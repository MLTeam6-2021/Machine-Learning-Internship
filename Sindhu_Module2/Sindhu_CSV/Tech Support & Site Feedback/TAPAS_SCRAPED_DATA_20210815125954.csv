2,Freezing and Crashing on Mobile Devices; Lag on Laptops,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello, I'm user Thirdly on tapas. I didn't know where to report this, but I have been noticing a frequent freezing up on some of my favorite comics that didn't happen about a month or so ago. It's been happening on all my mobile devices. It's on comics like #Muted by kandismom. I love the comic and the artwork, but I can't for the life of me read the last several updates on my mobile devices (where I used to before with no difficulties). The pages freeze and the tapas app crashes. I don't know if it's the high resolution of the images, the increased traffic of a popular comic, or a mixture of both that is causing it. But, I can confirm that on my laptop, there is a definite ""lag"" and ""drag"" whenever I try to scroll down to read the pages...while on my mobile devices, it just freezes up and crashes (my mobile devices are an LGK40 and an iphone, which is why I am so concerned...my LGK40 has limited memory, but my iphone is downright empty).","[""I don't have my iphone or laptop on me, but I can give out the information on my usual phone and will give you more information on the others later today when I'm home-\nMobile Device: LG K40OS: It's saying Android version 9 (there was actually an update when I checked it, so I am testing as I go)Browser: Actually, when I couldn't use the apps, I would try the browser and it worked a little better (I used Chrome on one and Safari on the other)App versions: LG K40- version 5.5.4 (which I don't think was the version I had before)\nI will keep an eye on the LG K40 and keep you updated.

11,Is there Alt Text/Image Descriptions for comics?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I'm uploading my first comic to Tapas and as a disabled person I try to keep accessibility in mind. One thing I do is provide alt text/image descriptions for all my images on social media. Is there such a feature on Tapas, as I can't seem to find one? If not, why hasn't this been implemented yet?
Thanks in advance.","['This is actually a really good point, maybe we could bring this up with the staff as a potential feature, @ratique ?', ""There's author's note, which technically works as any other description feature on other social media platforms, is it not? Is there other more convenient ways to do it, like push up notification when you click on the page you mean?"", 'You mean the note you can put at the very end? That\'s only once per episode, right? I would have to cram so much text into the author\'s note to provide image descriptions for every single page per episode, and it also wouldn\'t be lined up alongside each image.\nPeople who use alt text (I don\'t use it myself so I\'m just going off what I know) usually have software that reads it out to them. It looks at the image and then it looks at the alt text that\'s attached to the image and reads that out, if that makes sense. Like you know when an image on a webpage doesn\'t load properly and it instead says ""image_of_a_flower.png"", that\'s alt text. So instead of ""image_of_a_flower.png"" it would read out the full image description for that page.\nHere\'s an example of the kind of alt text I write for one of my pages:\n\n[Image description: A comic page of 6 panels in black and white. The art style is cartoonish with soft grey shading.\n1: A Victorian mansion sits amongst the English countryside. Caption boxes in a handwritten font say: ""November 1st, 1888. It is cold outside today.""\n2: A young man (Percy) sits indoors, writing in his diary. Caption: ""I almost thought not to go for my daily constitutional, but it is the only chance I have to see the outside world. In any case, I doubt Worthington would allow me to stay indoors, drowning in self-pity all day.""\n3: Percy looks out the window, watching another, bulkier man in working clothes - Worthington - tending to a bush in the garden. Caption: ""For a man who doesn’t speak, he can be surprisingly insistent.""\n4: Worthington looks up, meeting his eye.\n5: Percy looks caught off guard. Caption: ""Sometimes I think he can read my mind.""\n6: Percy looks away. Caption: ""But then, I suppose it is the job of a servant to know his Master’s whims.""\nEnd image description.] \n\nHope that helps clarify what I mean?', ""Yes, thank you. I don't know how it works on other sites, since for me most of them are the same (as in, you cannot put a description for every picture on Instagram or Twitter if you put a few of them in one post so it's the same as on Tapas, but I guess you can do it on Facebook).

24,Bug: Early Access comics don’t remember my place,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"This has been going on for months so I have a good amount of data on it: when I get a notification that an early access comic I'm subscribed to has updated, and I click that notification to go to the comic, it takes me NOT to the most recent page, but to a specific older page every time. Affected comics include The Flying Ship, Finding Home and Charity Case. I do not have an early access subscription to any series, so I get ""updates"" as the pages are released to the general public.
To use an example for clarity, the past eleven times I've gotten notified that The Flying Ship has updated, the link has taken me to episode 216 (4.37 - Of All The Days) instead of the most recent one. Before that, it was episode 200 (4.23 - SLAM!). 
It seems to have something to do with certain pages not being marked as read, since episode 200 appears in black in the chapter list while episode 199 appears in grey. Similarly, episode 216 and all after it are black, but 215 is grey. (See images) It seems like when I go to a series to see the latest update, it takes me to the episode after the most recent ""read"" episode, so if none of the pages can be marked read, I'll keep getting bumped back to that certain point in the archive whenever I go to read it.
Would love to see a fix for this very annoying bug.","[""It looks like some sort of fix has been applied?

There’s a really great series on Tapas right now called “Wait Where the Shooting Star Falls” . It just got officially released and translated not even a month ago (6/11). I was really excited to start buying officially UNTIL I began to relive that parts of the episodes were messed up! Last time I brought this up it was when episode 11 was missing an entire panel (with kind of a big reveal!) I brought that up and luckily it was resolved very quickly. But now, just four episodes later, there’s another issue! The panel is at least still there but look at the difference!(Click to expand)

Incidentally, when set to ON, the direction of episodes in the episode list (old (previous) is down, new (next) is up) does not match the direction of the arrows shown on the ""Prev"" and ""Next"" browsing buttons in the bottom button bar: there, ""Prev"" always shows as up, and ""Next"" always shows as down--the opposite of the direction readers are actually moving in the episode list when the episode is set to the Descending order ""ON"" setting.","[""That does seem to be a problem on my end as well, it's always going to the first regardless of how you've set it up.

71,Ad revenue stalled entirely?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"

The last date according to Tapas that I earned any ad revenue was on Feb 23rd. Every date until today is blank and devoid of data. However, the snapshot page shows that I've had ad impressions. A fair amount of them. So what's going on? I'd understand a few weeks of delay but ... a few months?

Anyway, @ratique , or any of the other mods (sorry I don't know which mod is over tech support to bug) is this supposed to happen? Because if it says the cap is 10 MB, then it's unfair to add a size upon uploading.

Am I the only one who feels this way?","[""The comics feed has been lacking diversity for a while where at first it was a rotation of a lot of the same most popular authors and now with bl/romance comics being what's most popular that i imagine is what's populating the comics feed.\nI'm almost certain that requests and concerns had been raised in the past about this but honestly I'm beginning to loose more and more hope that what's promoted on Tapas will change in favor of those who are lesser known especially in the realm of community comics.

It's not helping Tapas's case that their biggest competition are improving significantly in this regard.

(Still tilted toward romance, but that's unsurprising given the size of that genre.)\nI'm still on Tapas because I have readers here who I love interacting with, and I love the forums. But that's it.

I\'m a pretty avid reader but I often have to dig pretty hard to find things I like since I tend to not enjoy comics without fantasy or supernatural elements and a lot of the promoted BL tends to be more slice of life taking place in our reality (which is totally good but just not my cup of tea). I often either go through ""fresh"", look at people\'s recommendations, or scroll down to the ""new from the community"" section to find the hidden stuff. ""Community comics"" and ""staff picks"" can also have some nice new stuff, but lately have had a lot of repeats of  stuff with big followings which I have either already read or tried which is just not super helpful to me reading, in both regards to premium and free to read.

84,Size guideline “No height limitation ?”,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello everyone,It's really not in my habit to complain, but I will still share a great dissatisfaction that I have regarding the news size guideline.

Size guideline
You can upload an image of· Maximum capacity of 10MB· Maximum width of 940px· No height limitation(*Only if an image is in gif, height limit of maximum 1000px applies.)
Auto cropping feature
Images with a height of 2000px or higher will be automatically uploaded as multiple images.

At first i was happy to see that there's no longer a height limitation. I thought it would be easier for me to upload my episodes, because they're very long and i always had to cut them into many little images for each update. But then i was surprised to see that there's a limitation to 40 files max !
Which means that the size limitation is even more restricted than before! I am honestly disappointed with this change and do not understand it. I have always preferred Tapas to Webtoon because I didn't have the same concerns about uploading my episodes. But now Tapas became worse then Webtoon and I have to find a solution and cut my episodes in several parts which ruins the pacing.","['Oh no, that\'s bad.They should keep the old feature since it worked.There\'s an old saying, ""when it works, don\'t change.""', ""I'm pretty sure there was always a file limitation of 40 files per episode. If that's not the case, what was the file limitation before?"", ""It's always been 40 files, even back when they had height limits.

You're making a complaint about something that didn't change at all."", ""\n\nIris-Grimoire:\nYou're making a complaint about something that didn't change at all.\nAuto cropping is at every 2000px, that means one long file of 4000px after being auto cropped becomes 2 files of 2000 px each. That is a valid concern of the OP and for the rest of us who upload files in excess of 2000px. \n20 of these 4000px files will max out the 40 file limit that did exist before, but was not a problem when files were not auto-cropped."", ""The problem is actually the height limit to crop. Before, the height limit was 4000, now it's 2000. It means that a page with 4000 of height takes now the space of two files instead of one, so the total length maximum is smaller.\nI wish they would go back to pages of 4000px, honestly. I've been doing pages within this limit since always, and the cropping messes up the sharing thumbnail. They could keep the cropping feature, just increase the page height limit."", ""Yeah, and before that, the limit was 4000px, so you'd still need to use at least 2 files.\nedit: oh wait GloamingCat already brought up that. Well, I'd ping the community staff account to see what they have to say about that, didn't know it conflicted with the thumbnail either."", ""I never had that problem before, so something has clearly changed, and @CarltonIsaac just pointed out what it is. It's the Auto cropping at 2000px. "", ""I think it depends on the complexity of the piece--I can fit WAY more now than I used to, because my images are very gradient and color heavy. Before I was never able to actually splice to 2000px (or was it 4000px? I forget. But there was a cap at how big your file could be in MB and not in height), I would have to splice at 1200px.

Like how much white space is your file if a splice is only 148.5 kb? Mine are about 1 MB per splice. And like I took a peek at your comic and it's shorter than mine, but also less colors, so was this just an extra long one?\nHopefully it is just a glitch cuz that's pretty weird."", 'We will try to solve this problem asap and get back to you!', ""@ratique The concern clearly comes from the automatic cropping. Because, i quote : Images with a height of 2000px or higher will be automatically uploaded as multiple images.. Clearly if I download 4 files that are 25000px long, I would ultimately have more than 40 files/images due to the crop.

I think it would be valuable for Tapas to create a separate category for Paranormal/Supernatural versus Mystery as these genres are very distinct from each other.

They sent me this on May 19th, and are basically telling me that my whole series Hey, I'm Gay!8 was softblocked for some doodles I did back in 2017, which supposedly contain ""mature content"".
The doodles themselves:

insta stories_Tapas_doodles.png841x529 134 KB

I am okay with censoring my comic if that means I can show it safely. But I am not okay with staff members telling me that they have blocked MY WHOLE SERIES for 4 doodles that appear in a single episode.
They didn't warn me. They didn't even send me an e-mail about it, or even tell me:  ""Please, censor it today, or we'll have to softblock your series"". No, they told me they already have soft blocked my whole series TROUGH A MESSAGE ON MY TAPAS WALL. 
E-mails exist for something, and it seems they use it only to send ""news"" about their official comics instead of using it to contact the creators themselves. 
And why did they have to block my whole series? Making it impossible for readers to see my comic through the app? Why not just block that problematic episode instead?
My whole series has been blocked since May 19th, that's 12 days without being able to receive any view or ink drop from readers through the app.
Oh, and the most frustrating thing? They send this message, and then when you already censor it, they IGNORE YOU. I don't care if it's Sunday. They had me working in the censorship today as well, so I could have a chance to start having views today. BUT NO. They are not working today, they don't have any person in their social media.

I get that Tapas is a business and it's necessary to have these push notifications about new premium series etc....But one just crashed my computer and I really feel like I need to flag this as an issue.
I have my Windows 10 set up so that only ""alarm"" notifications will show up while I'm playing a game. This means that most Tapas notifications, like ones about likes and comments and the like will not pop up on my screen when I'm in the middle of something that's pushing my computer's processor.But lately I've noticed that the ones with the pictures about Tapas premium series still pop up even if I'm playing a full-screen game. Worse, it's impossible for me to make them go away without clicking on the ""close"" button, which jumps me from the game to Windows, which may be in a different resolution. Just now, this jump caused my whole system to crash as I tried to remove a big advert by clicking ""close"" while in the middle of a game of Warhammer II Total War, got thrown into Windows and then had my system freeze.
Is it really necessary for these advert notifications to be set as ""Alarms""? I don't want to have to mute all Tapas notifications just for this, or to mute all alarms because sometimes they're important things like reminders about meetings at my day job or appointments etc. I'm not asking for the removal of ad notifications, but I'd really appreciate this setting being changed.

100,Files are compressing on me,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Something I've noticed and hasn't been a problem with past updates (this is for something I uploaded this week to my scheduled updates) is that, while I expect some file compression on the files I upload to Tapas, I'm getting a LOT more file compression than usual, which makes a fuzzy appearance on my details. I did the uploads a few times, and I tested by resaving my files a few times thinking...maybe it's on my end. But, while it's a little hard to tell the difference, it gives my perfectionist heart an ache because I spent time and energy making this look clear, and now on the update it just...fuzzes it out anyway.
hopefully this won't compress the image as I upload it to the forum, but this is a part of the original file that has pretty crisp hatching (and this full file is 940 px wide, but so tall it will get cropped by the editor)

And after uploading, the same details become fuzzy.

the-fuzziness.jpg296x537 118 KB

Again...this may look almost the same, but previous updates never had this happen to this degree, so I think some update to the editor is causing it to just...compress more than it normally does?

101,I don’t get the library system at all,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"My biggest issue with Tapas continues to be with the library system and what episodes the site leaves me on and all of that. There's no way to sort the library other than ""unread,"" ""date,"" and ""name,"" but today, when I clicked on several stories to catch up on them, instead of giving me the episode where I left off, each story I clicked catapulted me to random episodes with a pattern I couldn't quite understand.
That's not to mention the site's very annoying habit of marking an episode as read just because you clicked on the story at all. Anytime I ever click on a certain story to, say, share the URL with a friend, the main URL will usually show me the most recent episodes I have not read.. and mark that as read as well. Then, if you refresh for any reason... it marks the NEXT episode as read as well!

Honestly, sitting there counting and trying to remember up to what day in the month or next month I have uploaded until is hard.

I go back to their page and the comic is there, it has been updated and works perfectly fine and I'm not blocked.

I thought I was accidentally unsubscribing because in the left side we have the chapters navigation and it randomly includes the subscribe/unsubscribe button, maybe I was unsubbing while navigating and that's why I didn't say anything. But  last night before going to sleep I had 99 comic saved, I didn't navigate any of them and today there are 98...so this one is not attributed to the accidental unsubbing.

151,Errors in statistics - subscriptions and likes,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello!
Recently I've noticed that there is a difference in numbers between what's displayed on my profile, on dashboard, and on the page of my one and only series regarding subscriptions and likes. As is: 
Subscriptions on profile: 125
Subscriptions on series and dashboard (and app): 124



However, when you count the subscribers by yourself on the list (on website), there are actually 125 after all (not that much counting, just number of pages multiplied by 20 which is how many subs are displayed by page + the number on the last page). I don't suppose it's the matter of having a lost subscription, as recently I did actually lose one and both numbers went down by a factor of 1.
A similar thing happens with likes, though it's even wilder in discrepancy. 
Dashboard: 193 (total) likes - does it perhaps still count removed likes or something?
Series info (website): 187 likes
And the app says 190 likes.
However, when you count likes on dashboard>performance, the total is 191. I'm also getting 191 after counting likes on series' episode list on the series sidebar.
Perhaps with the likes it's a matter of a delay in updates, but it's been over a week since I've noticed the subscriptions error, would it really take that long? It doesn't matter what browser I use either. Clearing cache and cookies didn't change anything as well.
Links to profile and series in case you'd like to check what numbers you see.

Of course people tend to say that there is copyright infringement, but, unless you are claiming to own the characters, or anything from the franchise (as logos, or music), you are protected with under Fair Use. The biggest problem here is not the protection under what the creator creates, but how he protects himself, as there is a disproportion of forces between the industry and the creators. For example, if you create a Fanfiction of Harry Potter, we all know how J.K. Rowling may answer if she get to know about it, and you will have to go tothe court to prove your point, and there is a big difference between the economic capability of a little fanfiction creator, and J.K. Rowling and Warnes Brothers to hire lawyers.In those same lines. for a site, like Tapas, Webcomics, or even DeviantART, its easier to don't expose Fanfictions to avoid all the 'cease and desist' orders, instead of offering the legal protection that we are entitled. It will cause too much noise, and for that they prefer the 'just original creations' aproach for their creators.Another way to avoid the 'cease and desist' orders is if the work is free to everyone (besides avoiding as much as it can the trademarked things, and give credit to the owners/creators), but as people mentioned before, there is the tricky part of the subs, and the redirections that you can offer in Patreon and donations sites. Fun Fact, Patreon is full of weird comic/fanfictions/mature content that are payed to be seen. How do they manage to keep working after doing what they do? I have absolutely no idea. Maybe because the patreons do not do much noise, and most of the content can't be seen until paid, the corporate industry don't bother with them.\nSorry for going outside topic, now you can go back to the genres and variety issue =D"", 'Understandable.

Though I am curious now, how exactly does it work? I'm still confused as to what I'm supposed to be doing to generate revenue, or if it's some form of passive income. Furthermore, I didn't see any spot for entering paypal information or do you have to wait until you earn revenue for that. 
Given I only have a hundred subscribers, I'm not expecting any revenue gains to be substantial. But I was planning on using them to pay for more artwork and other things to support the writing.

I saw some people thinking they will make a bank with ad revenue but it's not really a case. Still, passing 100 subs and actually unlocking ad revenue is still a big accomplishment itself. Many people never reach that number or get there after many years, so you should be definitely proud.\nThe real fun begins at 250 subs when you unlock ink support. With that, you can make some actual money, dollars, not only cents, but it still depends on how generous people are to you. Once you get 25 dollars and they are made available, you can withdraw the money. \nI hope this helps somehow.

197,FEATURE REQUEST: Stats regarding the percentage of readers accesing Tapas from mobile devices VS the website,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"This is something I'd find deeply informative, and very useful when making decisions about how my comic is formatted and released.
At the moment, I release Blue Star Rebellion in a standard comic book page format here on Tapas.  I have a vertical version on WEBTOON, a formatting decision I made because the audience there is younger, and many readers only have access to their phone as a digital device. I've been debating whether to make the change to a vertical format here on Tapas, too, but I've been hesitant, as I do like reserving a space for my page format version to be enjoyed.
It would be invaluable to have access to stats regarding what percentage of Tapas readers in general read on mobile vs webpage, and be able to compare those with the same stats but specifically for one's own comic. 
If, let's say, 60% of readers on Tapas read using the mobile app, but only 10% of my own readers do, clearly I'm missing a huge chunk of potential audience and I should probably change my posting format. But if those numbers weren't so disparate, I'd feel much more secure in my decision to keep posting my comic in its original page layout.
Is there anywhere public where the up-to-date stats regarding website vs mobile access for Tapas in general are available? Having access to just those stats alone would be pretty helpful. The last hard stat I could find was on a 'Creators Guide To Taptastic' comic from 2014.  (That one said 6 in 10 readers were on mobile.)","['Yes this would be a really helpful feature. \nI know the analytics we have are going to be limited by the fact that Tapas doesn\'t ask for a lot of data on our profiles (fair, can\'t complain, I know a lot of us are sick of giving out personal data), so I can\'t request things like ""how old are my readers? What gender? What country are they from? Where do subscribers and readers find the comic? (ie. app/page, external links like the forums, social media sites like twitter and insta)"" even though those are stats I\'d love to have... But knowing if people are reading mostly on the app or browser would be a nifty stat to have!', 'The common answer is to assume that the future is in the app. Tapas does always make and seek scroll format when they make their series.
