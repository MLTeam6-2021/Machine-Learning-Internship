1,"Webtoons View counter, BROKEN?",Answered,[],"I just updated my main comic as I always do on Saturdays, and I saw that in the Spanish version of the Webtoons site, my comic went from 2.4K views, to 3.1K views in 5 hours!
And the English Version on Webtoons also went from 1.9K to 2.1K within the same span!
I was surprised for seeing such a rapid increase on views, and subscribers too. I had something around 101 and now I'm at 117!
But then I updated my secondary comic (I have a more chaotic schedule on this one), and went from 202 views to 353 in less than 15 minutes.
I label it as Mature, so I expect it to have less views, and it seems suspicious that both comics went up on views like that.
Looking for answers on twitter I saw other creators posting how since yesterday their comic views and subs rocketed too, but no other comment on why.
Is anyone else experiencing this? Am I missing something? Is someone reloading the site multiple times or using bots or something?","['That\'s because of Webtoon event, which rewards readers with free coins for reading 10 episodes of a comic. You\'ve updated, and it landed you in on top on ""sort by date"" section, which meant people coming to get coins saw your comic. \nAs for why the second one didn\'t get a sharp increase: you may have updated it later in the day, when most active readers got their coins for the day already or/and the genre of the second comic either more competitive with creators or less popular with readers.', 'It all makes sense now! although LMAO, I guess  I have to stay tuned with these events.\nThanks!', ""Yeah the hashtag for the event is #canvashiddengems so go and use it to promote because it's been a nice boost.""]",7/31/2021 22:56

3,Comic artists with experience hiring an editor or writer,Answered,[],"Hi guys, first time posting here...honestly kind of nervous. Anyway, I have a script and general outline of my comic. I'm not the best writer, even writing a resume will take me 10 tries. English is not my native tongue although I have used English for a long time. That being said I am not the best writer in my native langue either.
For artists who hired a writer for things like dialogue or other comic-related things, what is your experience? And do you personally think it has increased the reading experience of your comics? I'm just not sure about my situation, should I hire a writer or an editor. I have a limited budget so I want to know what would be the most suitable choice for me.
Any suggestions or personal experience/thoughts would be great  
thank you ","[""I haven't hired outside help, though I can give some food for thought.\nYour English here is clear and comprehensible enough, so you could get away with an editor who has solid grammar to just tidy things up here and there. That being said...\n...a big part of what makes a comic really engaging, for me at least, is the believability of the dialogue between characters. Does it sound natural? Does it flow well? Does the personality of each character shine through in the way they speak?\nIf you're pretty confident with your ability to write down a conversation, you likely don't need a writer. If you can read back what you've written out loud, and it reflects your characters well, you're on the right track there. An editor can simply help you tidy up any mistakes.\nBut if you're not sure you can write a natural sounding conversation, this is where a writer comes in. You can give a writer a rundown of what the conversation needs to include, and the personalities of the characters involved, and a writer can turn that into engaging dialogue.\nIf you're unsure, have a read of other comics which have good dialogue in them, and read some conversations out loud. Then, read your script out loud. Compare the two. If your script sounds pretty good, and there are just a few clunky bits and spelling/grammar errors, an editor is likely all you need. But if the characters sound unnatural, and the conversation between them doesn't sound much like how people actually speak, you'll want it re-written."", ""Thank you, that is really some insightful feedback. I really want this comic to work out, but I'm worried the dialogue is shallow and frankly...not interesting to read"", 'I have a friend who helped me with the proofreading starting from chapter 20 or so and who is now helping me fix grammar mistakes in the first chapters as well. Can\'t really say much about hiring a writer, since I tend to prefer writing my own stories, but so far my proofreader has been helping me immensely <3 having a second pair of eyes to look at your work when you\'re not feeling 100% confident about it and/or someone who can confirm whether or not a certain sentence sounds good in English is definitely helpful. My proofreader\'s questions and insights have also been an amazing source of inspiration in some cases!  That said, it\'s also true that you should always keep in mind that the story you\'re writing is yours and that, as much as the help of a proofreader/editor can be valuable, nobody is going to know your story better than you, so if there\'s a suggestion you don\'t feel would be right for your story, you shouldn\'t feel forced to use it no matter what. \nOne notable example with my current proofreader would be with a chapter I was writing: they found the cliffhanger at the end not satisfying enough and, had it been up to them, they\'d probably have told me to edit it so that the ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys would fight instead. Problem is... at that point, the story was only halfway through and putting a fight there would have just brought things to a climax despite the fact that half of the main cast had yet to meet. Eventually, when my reader got to see the chapters that came after, they agreed that a fight at that point would have been premature and would have made the story too rushed. In short: listen to all suggestions, take notes, but don\'t be afraid to say no when necessary ^_^', ""From my experience, I can only recommend you to get more eyes on your project. Having someone to do the typos and grammar is in many cases a must. Even if you feel you have it all covered, you as the creator can easily become blind to small mistakes because you know your story and dialogues so well.\nHaving others to read your story and give honest feedback is also a treat. There are from time to time people offering reviews and other help here at the forum you can look out for. \nBut having a dedicated creator to help me out as I create is one of the best thing that I have experienced. Both paid and non-paid. \nAnd right now I have a little service that I offer here:\n\n\nFree dialog writer to improve your comic/script Reviews | Feedback\n\n\n    Hello! Jens Richard here, I'm about to go full business pro and will take commissions at some point, but for that, I need to practice my writing skills by offering free help for your dialog. \n\nFirst I will make it clear that this isn't proofreading or editing, but a simple adjustment to the dialog you already have, just to make it even better, more clear, or more funnier for the reader.  \n\nI will not run over your entire story, but I will give you some good examples where I find something that c…\n  \n\n"", 'Thank you for the input  I felt as much too. I think feedback and constructive criticism is very beneficial for emerging writers/comic artists. Did your readers notice the sudden change in dialogue after chapter 20? Was the change noticeable in a positive way?', 'Thank you!! I will take a look. Plenty thanks to the reply as well. Has your creators changed your plots for the better? For example you were favoring one idea but they ultimately talked you out of it because it wasn\'t suitable for the characters etc? I\'ve heard ""kill your darlings"" when it comes to writing~ So I thought I\'d ask.', 'Indeed they had. One of my stories was unintentional too dark and was more for the horror genre than fantasy. I quickly changed the tone, because that was not my goal and I didn’t see my story as horror. \nOther stuff that had helped me was me not give the proper characters proper care for the readers. They have to care for them to be able to follow them. \nRemember, characters come first then you place them in a world with a plot.', ""No noticeable changes to report  the work of an editor mostly consists of correcting typos, grammar mistakes and/or suggesting phrases that might have a better flow, and my proofreader does pretty much the same, so the writing is still mine! So far, there were just a couple of instances where my editor came up with a whole sentence to replace mine (again, mostly to fix the flow/grammar, not the overall meaning of the phrase): in those cases, I gave 'em credit for the help (I mean, I always do, but with those chapters I made sure to specify which parts of the dialogue my proofreader helped me fix in particular).""]",7/20/2021 5:04

It's just what is more beneficial for one.Hope that explains this. "", ""So basically, If I want my topic to be more viewed, it should relate to a lot of other people, and hasn't been made yet?"", ""Like I said in my first post; there's technically a method to the madness, but it's so complex and obtuse that it might as well be random. You can do some things that can affect your odds, but a lot of it is still left up to right-place-right-time. There's a balance to strike between having something accessible with a broad appeal that lots of people are going to like, and something niche and unique that doesn't look like everything else out there.\nFor example: 'promote your stuff here' is no different from any other promo post on this forum, so why would anyone click on it instead of any of the others? On the other hand something like 'Tokusatsu (small niche genre of Japanese television. Think Power Rangers or Ultraman) creators share your comic here!' is so small and niche that basically nobody is going to fit the bill and want to engage with that post.So something in the middle; the 'post your latest page' thread is a great example of this. It's something that everyone can do, no matter what type of comic they're making or what sort of skill level they have, but it lets each person post something unique. People are going to want to click on it to see what everyone's most recent art looks like, and they're more likely to want to engage with it.\nEven then, there's an element of randomness; if you post it at the wrong time of day when not many people are on, then it's off the front page before people who would have engaged with your post are looking, and they usually don't go digging through stuff that's too far off the front page. If you don't happen to get any good artists sharing their stuff then it'll look like amateur hour and nobody really cares. Alternatively, if you ONLY get really skilled artists posting, then less-experienced creators might get intimidated and not feel comfortable sharing their stuff.All of those things are, to some degree or another, entirely out of your control. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, which is why I said you just have to keep placing your bet until it pays off."", 'Alright, thanks for explaining!', ""You could do that.\nIf I may suggest, you could do a promo thread that asks for more creativity than just link dropping.Like, making a thread to promote like a door-to-door salesperson, perhaps?Of course, what you do is your business, but I can dig it more if I have to work for the promotion.\nJust don't get frustrated when nobody answers your thread. Here are a lot of users living in different time zones. Give it some time and somebody will answer."", 'Thank you for your response, I understand now!', ""Honestly in my opinion, promotions on the forums don't do too much to my numbers which is why I stopped after a couple few posts. It might even create more dead subs since so many people are trying to promote here and do sub 4 sub, which can make your comic/novel become even harder to find. and sure, having a popular comic/novel is great and all, but it's also interesting to see how well I can do naturally without pushing it into people's faces.\nA lot of people on the forums aren't looking to read topics that are self promotion, personally if I see any promotional threads, I'll just ignore it unless it's included with an interesting topic/question."", 'I\'ll be honest here. If you are just on the forums JUST to promote. You will not have a good time and would not last.\nAlthough self promotion does occasionally give you engagement, this is more a place to make connections and get writing and art advise, and ask for comics and novels to read kinda place. Really when all a persons posts are just;""HEY check out my comic"". eventually these people get ignored and I\'ll be honest I get 100% turned off from checking out their work.\nReally self promotion although happens alot here, rarely gets the engagement you will expect it does. Things like posting example art when a topic specifically asks for it can work. Read for reads also help gain readership. Although I have seen folks just link dump and go ""hey check me out"" and not bother read the other stuff on the thread. (a quick way to not make people engage with you again).

I myself will build sets for backgrounds in my comic, then screenshot the angle I need, and from there strip the lines and draw over any changes to make quick background line work, similar to how many comic artists use 3D modelers. However, the the characters, colors, and even much of the line art itself is revised to fit within my art style. While the Sims 4 can be great for set building, perspective angles, and even figuring out character outfits, I don't recommend using it for the entirety of a comic,.\nThis is not just because the art itself would not be coming from you, but rather a company as well as possible modders, but EA is also extremely intense over copyright infringements.

19,Survey for gamers,Answered,[],"I will have 2 gamer characters. They are side characters but one of them will be more important. I am not a gamer myself so I am unsure on how to show people that they are gamer (they can’t play games for the whole duration of the comic )
If you are a gamer, please give me some insights on:What habit you might have developed from playing games? Both good and bad.Any gaming jargons you use in everyday life?Anything else?","['Gamer here also in school for game development \nWhat habit you might have developed from playing games? Both good and bad.\nIt\'s hard to say whether the habits I have were developed through gaming or not. I have ADHD and because of that I am able to hyper-focus when I play and am also good with multi-tasking, which are great for gaming, but it was not caused by gaming. Though I will say, thanks to gaming I have had an outlet for my ADHD and other things. A lot of people tend to blame gaming for their sleep schedule though, so perhaps your characters could have a bad sleep schedule. And studies show that gaming increases hand-eye coordination as well as help with team building skills.\nAny gaming jargons you use in everyday life?\nI don\'t really see gamers using gamer jargon outside of gameplay much, especially not every day so that might be pushing it a little bit. One thing I do use regularly would be saying ""happy level up"" for someone\'s birthday just because it feels better to acknowledge they have gained more XP (experience) rather than just getting older. Sometimes I do say GG (""good game"" said after a match/battle) just for the heck of it.\nAnything else?\nIf you want to portray them as gamers, I would suggest for the most part having them wear t-shirts related to gaming or other merchandise that they wear or have in their homes. They might have game related ringtones. Typically, gamers aren\'t really over-the-top when portraying themselves in public (unless you want to write them in an exaggerated way like that), so I think it will be fine just to give them gamer merch and have them complain about their daily quests and rewards going to waste because they can\'t play.', 'Thank you!! Your explanations are very detailed and your tips are great! I can confidently develop these characters now with these information. Thanks!', ""1) What habit you might have developed from playing games? Both good and bad.\nI tend to always look for ways to optimtize things, in games if I notice dashing or triangle jumping makes me move a bit faster I do that even if it is excessive... I take that into real life too which can be great for work, but not so great for like... Cooking... Which I often screw  up because I tried to make it faster.I also do things like studying statistical probability in board games and apply that to my gameplans to help deal with uncertainty.I have also developed excelent spatial memory thanks to videogames... Like i can vividly remember a hotel room I went to over 10 years ago on a trip to the beach, even though I can't remember the people that were there with me... I could actually draw you a map of the places I was too even today xDProbably my worst trait is my competitveness... When I play a game, ANY GAME, my default brain is to try 100% to win... I often have to remind minself to tone it down when playing for fun otherwise I get super anxious and irritable, especially when playing with friends.And last but not least, I move around a lot while thinking... I only noticed this recently, but sometimes when I'm like playing a game and there is a puzzle I'll often jump around or do anything I can as I try and figure it out... I noticed I do that a lot in real life too, when i'm not busy i move through every seat in the house trying to find something to entertain with.\n2) Any gaming jargons you use in everyday life?\nI actually have always tried to avoid that... I see a lot of media that trys to cater to gamers doing that and I always found that cringy, the most recent offender i saw was glitch techs, they do that ALL THE TIME (and don't get me wrong, i loved that show)... This is due to me growing up in a rural city and video games not being popular when I grew up so it was always a 'weird' thing and I was 'the weird kid' who like it... So It's a personal thing, i'm not judging anoyone, and it's totally fine to do it, I just get embarassed for myself when I try it.That being said, I do use some table top rpg jargon IRL, but that is mostly because my friend groups are entirely revolved around that... Se we often get one another when we say 'I just botched my DEX save' or 'I didn't spec my character for CHAR'\n3) Anything else?\nI would highly recomend you research gaming things by generation... As I mentioned above, my experience as a gamer growing up was a lot different than some younger folks nowadays... Diferent generations of gamers will have different priorities, likes and dislikes... Like I for instance can't stand lootboxes and excesive DLC, and the whole pay to play thing mobile games do, but a younger gamer might be totally fine with it.I would also urge you to think carefully about what each game is targeting on people... Like a person whose favorite game genre  is metroidvania or RPG (like me) will have a completely diferent personality from someone who likes FPS, the games themselves are made for different kinds of people, so different people like them... And being a 'gamer' doesn't mean you like every game ever made.\nMetroidvania and RPG players tend to not mind graphics so much and are very throrough when it comes to exploration.FPS players tend to care a lot for graphical fidelity.Platformer players tend to care in great deal about mechanics and the deliberate use of them.Puzzle players want to take their sweet time and not feel like you held their hands.MMO players are veeeeeeeery patient, detail oriented, and will be okay with repeating content.And so many other genres, like sports games, strategy games, betting games, party games... You name it...\nEssentially, look for a game's main strenghts and say 'what kind of person would like this the most? And what kind of person would play this the best?' Remember, just because you're good at a game doesn't mean you like playing it... A musician could likely demolish most rythm games, but that doesn't mean they enjoy it.\n Finally remember that there is often the unspoken rule... Don't hate the player hate the game...Games (and particularly competitive games) have a way of awakening completely different versions of us... And that version is not us, it just a part of us... So a total cinamon roll of a person IRL might think gunning down civilians in GTA is fun, and that's totally acceptable and normal.Morality in the game ≠ morality IRL\nI would also encourage you to portray different types of gamers... Like... The stereotype for the word 'gamer' is either a super enthusiatic person who is WAAAAAY to into it, or an elitist nerd who thinks he is the absolute top notch person because he can speedrun mario without dying.Those are tired old stereotypes... Not to say you can't make characters that fit them to some extent, but remember a gamer is a person too, they have a life that doesn't involve videogames."", 'Here\'s a few little things that can show that they\'re gamers:\n\nIf there\'s ever a scene in one of their rooms, you can show a glowing RGB keyboard (they\'re just colorful keyboards)\nClothing-wise, you can make parody logos or homages to famous game franchises (God of War, Kingdom Hearts, literally any first-person-shooter logo, etc)\nShowing how their personality changes in a competitive setting. I\'m a really calm and patient person in nearly all stages of life, but there\'s something about the adrenaline rush of competitive gaming that awakens the predator in me! \nI blame gaming the most for this, though writing does it to me as well, time passes by quickly when I play games, and half the time, I don\'t even notice when morning comes. For a non-gamer, it\'s like when you binge-watch a show or stay on YouTube for too long. Same energy.\nSlang-wise, I try not to use any lingo away from my friends that play games, but the occasional ""gg (good game)"" leaves my mouth when either a long task is finished, or if I\'m congratulating someone\n\nHope this helped! ^^', ""What habit you might have developed from playing games? Both good and bad.\naside from an ability to multitask i'd say my hand eye coordination is pretty good as a result alongside spotting details, recognizing patterns and pretty god spatial awareness (tho more in games than irl i can't much help being a klutz sometimes). As for bad probably the development of a poor sleep schedule staying up for in game events or just being so fixated on playing that i lose track of time.\nAny gaming jargons you use in everyday life?\nit's usually random quotes but not so much in casual conversation than as jokes among fellow gamer pals or folks who i know would recognize them. More than anything it's the phrases I start using without realizing or it's something that was in my vocab that became popularized (like sus blowing up due to among us tho it's been a part of aave for a while i think). \nAnything else?\nevery gamer is different! so what one set of folks might have as normal behavior isn't the same for another. @djourner makes a strong point about looking at different generations of gamers and types of games.\nlike in my household my mom is more an old school gamer who grew up with arcade titles like pac-man and galaga and early home consoles like the NES. meanwhile i'm in the section a little while after with playstation, wii, xbox and switch and my preferences bounce around from racing to competitive co-op, action/adventure and the occasional rpg or dungeon crawler (depending on play style). and my younger sibling is the mobile games type with the few console titles being like pgr racing, surf's up or the mario & sonic olympic titles. it's different for everyone.\nalso wanna add while we don't live in gaming merch it's not uncommon for consoles to show up in a space or stuff like glowing keyboards or things associated with a certain franchise; think funko pops, figmas, tshirts or keychains. even notebooks slip into the mix now and then"", 'What habit you might have developed from playing games? Both good and bad.\'\n-unbelievable carpal tunnel-A lot of people who play games are really good at playing musical instruments--makes sense because we\'re kinetic. Either the music training influenced the way we play, or the other way around--it seems to work together to improve both skills. (so long as you don\'t get carpal tunnel) -Spreadsheets. If you get into games that have a lot of numbers, like card games or MMO\'s you gotta use excel to really figure out what your DPS is. So we like spreadsheets.-Listening to video game playlists, especially of very indie games no one\'s heard of but had a bangin soundtrack-Coding and breaking your computer: sometimes to get an old PC game to work, you just gotta...destroy your computer a little bit. Don\'t worry about it. It\'s fine.-Every person who likes games that much has made a couple games at some point. They lie unfinished in my hard drive but yo I even took a few classes about it, haha.\nAny gaming jargons you use in everyday life?\n-Well I\'d never use the word gamer! haha, it\'s kind of a hated word, honestly, especially if you\'re a girl, being called a ""gamer girl"" is the freakin worst. It\'s a word that marketers use on kids, so it\'s very condescending if you\'re an adult who enjoys games. If you\'re a woman who is constantly ignored by marketing at large then you doubly hate it. When gamers use it, it\'s usually as a joke to make fun of that type of aggressive marketing.\nAs for other things...there are rare instances I\'ve used jargon, but it\'s rare. Because life isn\'t like a video game, and when I use it, I do it in a joking way. I\'m never serious about using these words.:\n-Strats: anything I do efficiently I\'ll call my Cool Strats, but as a joke.-Speedrun: Most people know what a speedrun is now. So you can use it for things that aren\'t video games but are done really fast.-""casual"": I will sometimes say ""what a casual"" about things that aren\'t games as a joke since the word ""Casual"" has become such an overused insult that it\'s lost it\'s bite.-""cheevo"" for when you get an unexpected prize.\nBut I\'m having a hard time thinking what else I\'d say because for other things I try to keep video game jargon within a video game community. I don\'t really say it out loud. A lot of the jargon is through typing, said in chat (like ""F"" for respects)\nAnything else?\nEvery gaming community has completely different jargon. The fighting game community speaks differently than someone else who is from a Card Playing community or someone else who speedruns Zelda. So, you can just watch em on twitch to get a sense of how they speak. A Streamer will have a much higher tendency to speak in video game jargon, because theyknow their audience plays those games, too, so you\'ll get more notes on words to use.', ""@djourner @Oto_Kouda @VibrantFox @rajillustration\nWow thank you guys!! Lots of great tips!

You, as the writer should just go with the flow. You can create a situation of some sort, it could be romantic, but the way the character reacts to the situation, should be what would be normal for that particular for them and not what you're forcing them to do. \nI have three characters that went rogue on me and I honestly don't know what they're going to do next. I'm a little afraid."", ""I know it's possible, but is not that common. And the other thing is the character aromantic? Or asexual? Or introverted?If it's a short spam then there is no need, but if the character is not aromantic or asexual and it passes a long time then there should be something, I think only the athor could get to the conclusion cause we don't know the character, so we can't make assumptions about the personality.So @wekanian analyze your character, and do what feels ngood to you and believable."", ""I don't think it's weird at all but it all depends on the genre of your series. Honestly, some characters are better off without any love interest. If you think a love interest will further advance the plot then go for it, if not, then don't stress about it. My main character dan doesn't currently have a love interest and it will be awkward if he did. None of the females in my story fancy him or even care for him."", ""Whenever I see this dude , I can't stop thinking about the first drawing     PRICELESS!!!!!!!!!""]",5/23/2021 10:39
24,Workaround for Font Issues on Mobile?,Answered,[],"Hello,
I'm new on Tapas! Just started posting my novel a few weeks ago. But I'm already having troubles in using the site  When I view my chapters on the mobile app, the font style is not affected by the user preference settings (e.g. switching between serif and sans serif, changing font size). It's working with other novels but not with mine.
I googled a bit and found these two threads about the same issue:


I cannot adjust text size for my novel via mobile app Tech Support | Site Feedback


    When reading through my novel on mobile. I tried the font adjustment slider and the font change slider. Neither of them work with my novel.

Font issues with new novel episodes on app Tech Support | Site Feedback


    I had an episode update on Monday and experienced the same copy/paste, spacing, and text wrapping issues as everyone else. To fix this, I have been creating new episodes by actually typing out everything into the text editor, making sure nothing is copied and everything is fresh. I also found I can copy and paste if I hit enter in the text editor, then paste as plain text, then reformat everything. :unamused:

I tried to ""fix"" my previously published chapters based on the workarounds mentioned in the threads but my episodes remain the same.  
Things I tried:- clearing the formatting and reformatting on Tapas Text Editor- copy-pasting my work on my computer's text editor first (to clear the formatting, e.g. Notepad) before copy-pasting it into the Text Editor- switching to Firefox (from Chrome) and doing all of the above
Is there anyone else still experiencing this? Do you have any workaround?
Oh, and here's my novel that is having issues. Sorry if it's a bit of a shameless plug

27,HELP! I don’t know if this is the correct way to warn my readers!,Answered,[],"Hey, first of all, thank you for reading and helping. So to get to the point, there's a scene in my web-novel that depicts the use of derogatory names, sexual harassment, and a homophobic slur. I've checked the 'Content and Community Guidelines' and I am not breaking anything. I am not promoting nor encouraging hateful content. Now I just simply want to know if how I censored the content for readers was the correct way of doing it. Below I'll explain what I did.
So on the original chapter, I had written an 'author's note' to first warn my readers about the content. Then I suggested if they felt uncomfortable with the content, they could skip the chapter and instead read the safer copy of the chapter. (I clearly labelled the chapter title so they could find it.)
The safer copy of the chapter has those scenes and harmful words taken out, completely. Then at the bottom of the safer chapter, I wrote another author's note, indicating what had been taken out without describing the words and content.
I'm overall just hoping I did it right. I won't publish the chapter and safe chapter until I know it's okay. I don't wish to hurt anyone, but I don't wish to have to change the story because the chapter is an important part to my characters' story.
I also made sure to warn my readers in the summary description of my web-novel. I can't think of anything else I may need to do. My story is already rated mature and so are these specific chapters. I promise that my web-novel does not focus on such mature content, it focuses on my characters and their story. Please reply and let me know what you think. My web-novel is Past Life Lovers3.

30,[Answered] Advantages/disavantages of having a Tumblr mirror for comics?,Answered,[],"Hey everyone!
I recently learned that posting comics on Tumblr is a thing, and I wanted to see if anyone has experience with this (either as a reader or a creator). Mainly, I'm curious about the advantages or disadvantages of having a Tumblr mirror, or if there are any pitfalls to be aware of.
Thanks in advance!","[""If you do page format, you can make it look like a nice customized home page for your comic. I know a bunch of artists do that, and that's why they like tumblr for it--not necessarily for the sharing, but because it's easier to organize and post stuff than make a website from scratch."", ""I have my comic mirrored on Tumblr, actually. I've only just started, so it's hard to say for sure whether I've run into any upsides or downsides yet, but I CAN say that I've been on Tumblr long enough to have a modest but respectable following, which means I have another platform to promote on somewhat effectively. At the moment, I have the same number of subscribers on my Tapas comic as I do on my Tumblr (6 each), so it seems to be working so far."", ""@rajillustration - Thank you! That definitely makes a lot of sense. I'm not HTML savvy at all and want 0% of building a site from scratch. \n@scarlet_cryptid - That's really great to know that it's possible to build a following on Tumblr. Thank you for your insights!"", 'Pros:\n\nEasy to customize. There\'s a webcomic theme1 you can use, which you can customize with your own colors/graphics. Pretty similar to what you can do on ComicFury, with the main difference that Tumblr themes usually will also let you customize parts of the layout (colors, font and link colors, background,banners and so on) with a ""what you see is what you get"" type of interface, while on CF the great majority of customization has to be done in html and/or CSS.\nTags make your posts easy to find. Unlike Tapas, where episode tags do literally nothing, tags on Tumblr actually make it easier for your work to be found. Unless the site decides to shadowban you as it did with me, but that\'s another issue, I guess  anyway, make sure to know which tags work best to make sure your work gets seen and put extra care on your first 5 tags: apparently, they\'re the ones that truly matter to the site. \nReblogs are amazing for free promotion. If you get reblogged by the ""right"" user (aka, someone who has a huge readerbase) chances are your post could become pretty popular and more people will check out your blog. That isn\'t really a thing on Tapas/ComicFury/Webtoon and it is still truly one of the best features about Tumblr. \n\nCons:\n\nTumblr staff. I swear I\'ve never seen a staff that\'s so dead set on killing its own website like the Tumblr staff is. Every single new feature they\'ve implemented since the adult content ban has done nothing but break stuff that used to work perfectly and added little to no improvements to the site itself. Links to external websites? You can still post them, but your blog might be shadowbanned and not show up in search. So basically forget about linking to your Patreon, Redbubble, Gumroad or whatever. Oh, and even if your link is somehow NOT censored, Tumblr now adds url shorteners to your links that might be recognized as ""potentially dangerous"" by either your antivirus or by browser extensions such as uBlock Origin (gotta love how they did a whole campaign to ban Ad.fly and similar links from the platform because it was dangerous... only to add their own dangerous url shorteners to each and every link). Custom layouts? They\'re one of the key features of the website, but people are apparently getting banned from the site now for using them. Comments? We somehow managed to get them back after there was a HUGE uproar when the Tumblr staff removed them, but you only have a VERY limited amount of characters you can use and they\'re hardly useful for in-depth conversation (also, tags in replies only work once in a blue moon and people WON\'T be notified of your reply more often than not).The bots taking care of adult content? Sometimes they\'ll still flag completely innocent posts and then... good luck having an answer from staff. Once I had a post of mine flagged, sent an appeal about it... and absolutely NOTHING happened. For a year and half. Wrote staff multiple times about it, all I got in reply was a bot telling me to ""send an appeal"". Yes, I KNOW, that\'s exactly what I did, but you did nothing. Which brings us to the last point: contacting staff about any issues you may have with the site is basically useless. 9 times out of 10, you\'ll end up talking to a bot which suggests you to do the same exact thing you already did... and even if you get an actual human to answer, their reply is usually something along the lines of ""whatever, deal with it"". (YES, I\'M STILL SALTY, TUMBLR)\nReblogs are forever. Once somebody reblogs your post, you completely lose control over it. If you delete the original post, reblogs won\'t be deleted with it. If you edit your post (e.g. by updating a page), reblogs won\'t be affected, so you\'ll have old versions of your pages circulating on the website forever, unless you ask each and everyone of the users who reblogged your post to delete it. This can be especially problematic if your work ends up getting picked by a publisher, \'cos they may ask you to delete all pages that were posted online, but... if they\'ve been reblogged by a Tumblr user, you won\'t be able to. Pillowfort is much better in this sense, \'cos any post you delete will also delete any reblogs of it, buuuut... the userbase isn\'t nearly as big on there, the site is still in closed beta and the layout isn\'t as customizable as the Tumblr one.\n', ""@Llyrel - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such an in-depth response. I really appreciate that!\nAs good as the pros sound, it sounds like the cons are... pretty significant. I hadn't heard about the shadowbanning, the bot admins, or especially the reblogs. And that's crazy about the custom layouts getting people banned too! Goodness. I'm sorry to hear that your experience was problematic; a year and a half of appeals sounds incredibly frustrating! Did you ever get the issue resolved?\nSecondary question - Would you recommend ComicFury over Tumblr as an alternate mirror?"", 'You\'re welcome  yeah, the platform has been... kind of a mess, lately, at least from my point of view. Which is a shame, since I\'ve been on there for 11+ years and used to love it there. Most of my issues with shadowbanning were with an account I created about last year. I guess the staff decided it was a ""spam account"" because I was linking to my external blogs/websites (as I\'d been doing for years on my other account), but even after I contacted them and told them that I was not a spammer, they still did nothing about it. And then I started to have the same issues on my 11+ years old account too, so I decided to call it quits. As for the flagged post... nope, the post was still flagged when I eventually decided to delete that blog altogether, so it never got fixed -___- the only ""fix"" I could find was to repost the page as a new post and backdate it to make it show in the correct order. \nAs for ComicFury... yussss, I\'d totally recommend it! Mind you, the userbase is not nearly as big as that on Tumblr, as registered users on there are mostly comic creators rather than readers and there is no ComicFury app, making it more difficult for people on mobile to access your comic (unlike Tumblr/Tapas/WT), BUT the customization options are amazing and you can make really cool website, getting on the homepage is super easy (the site shows by default recently updated comics instead of popular ones), views tend to be higher (to compare, I have 14k views on CF and 3k on Tapas) and there\'s WAY less censorship about adult content (with a bunch of pretty in-depth tags you can use to specify the kind of content you make)  the forum is pretty nice too!', ""I went away with the porn.This topic itself surprises me. I didn't know tumblr still had a userbase."", ""It's nowhere near as big as it used to be in 2012, but some survivors are still there :'D only problem is that, as far as I could tell, they mostly seem to be interested in fanart. Which is a problem I forgot to mention, now that I think of it. \nOriginal art does have a chance to get seen... but overall interaction will be much, much lower compared to whatever you can get on fan art. I mean, just compare this nearly finished, almost fully rendered WIP of my OC Nigel1 I posted all the way back in 2018, with this extremely rough1 WIP of Julian from The Arcana I posted last year. The first one has 9 notes, the second one... 162 XD"", 'As someone who\'s read comics on Tumblr for a while now (mostly like fancomics), I can think of some:\nPros:\n\nTheme can be specialized for your comic due to how themes work. You can code them yourself, or you can search for one online.\nTumblr can accommodate about 10 photos in one post I believe? And you can actually hide a lot more under the ""Read More"" if you don\'t want your posts to be too long, so it\'s pretty convenient if you have a page format.\nTagging system is great. Seriously, I think Tumblr has one of the best tagging systems out there. I still get notes for art I did three years ago. You can even go on the search bar of a blog and search up every post in that blog under a specific tag (so for example, on your blog, you have a tag for #my art, you can search that tag on your blog and find all of your art posted in that blog).\n\nCons:\n\nIf you\'ve got an 18+ comic, you\'re out of luck. Your comic would get flagged (and if you\'re really unlucky, even your SFW stuff could get flagged too based on what I\'ve heard of how buggy the NSFW detecting bot is). Llyrel pretty much summed it up.\n10 photos in one post. Yea this is a con, but for vertical scrolling creators this time. As someone who works in that format, I know firsthand how many files a single of tose bugger episodes create once you split them, and I know 10 photos in a post is not enough lmfao. This is probably why the comics I read on Tumblr tend to either be in page format or very short, not-really vertical scrolling but it kinda is kinda way.\nCan be confusing for 1st time readers. The way Tumblr blogs tend to work is that they start off at the most recent post, so if you\'ve got a lot of pages... well yea. Authors tend to go about this issue by including a ""Next | Previous | First"" Hyperlink at the bottom, which kinda leads me to my next point....\nCan be frustrating to maintain, because you pretty much have to go through every one of your previous posts and add a hyperlink to your next page every time you post, and you probably also need to make an archive of some sorts containing all pages and extra content that readers can easily access and navigate, meaning regularly updating it, and having to go through huuundreds of posts and yea.\nCan be pretty hard to be visible there. Tumblr is a great place for artists to post through its layout, but sadly it\'s one of those sites that it can be hard to get any following for unless you make fancontent (which is par for the course for every social media site imo), my original art gets like 2 notes, but the fanart I\'ve made over the years still keep getting like, 20 notes. Seriously the dumb fanart I made for Brawlhalla in 2018 still keeps getting notes\n\nhehe just wanted to add on to Lyrel\'s list, as someone who\'s kinda used to reading comics on tumblr. Tumblr may be a hellsite, but it\'s not a bad place at all to post comics tbh. I don\'t really post on Tumblr anymore, haven\'t since like, last year? So I dunno. Take with a grain of salt ig.', ""@Llyrel - Agh, that sounds like a real mess indeed. Very sorry to hear that it went south like that, but it seems like you've found some good alternatives. Thank you or the information about ComicFury - I'll have to give them a closer look. That's pretty great with how customizable it is! \n@azzy-m - Thank you so much for explaining how the tagging system works and for the additional insights. I had very little idea about the tags, so that's really great to know! And yeah, it does seem like fanart is a requirement in order to get any kind of visibility, which is a shame since there's so much great non-fandom work out there. But good to know that it's not a terrible alternative mirror - maybe just one with a lot of caveats.""]",5/1/2021 1:38

The parents have plans to marry, so the boy and the girl will become step siblings, but they catch feelings for each other. They worry about the ethics of it all.
I remember there being a part where they were at a party (the after-party of their parent's marriage?) and they both were allowed to drink alcohol (it being Germany and all) and they both got a little too tipsy.
I also remember there being an episode where their parents go out for a few days and they both have the house to themselves, and they make a right mess, but I think their grandma helped?

I've got a question for the community this evening: How would you handle a significant change to your story?
The second chapter in one of my comics, which contains a B plot with a secondary cast, doesn't appear to be working for flow or visual storytelling. I know it's normal to lose readers, but I lost an unusual number of readers midway through this chapter. On top of that, my growth has stagnated for the last 2 months (about how long this chapter has been posting), so I know something is amiss.
Long story short, I think I want to cut the entire second chapter. However, I'm not sure whether it's better to:

Inform my readers and cut the entire second chapter
Quietly cut the second chapter and pretend it never happened
Make a new comic with the original uploads, minus the second chapter, and point people there
Something else...?

I don't want to lose reader trust, but I also don't want to push forward with the story as-is when it doesn't seem to be working... never mind that I'm not super happy about how it's coming across.
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much!","[""How far are you in the chapter? If it's like half done, may as well finish it, so long as it's not too much longer.

Tratr Website Design3.jpeg714x599 264 KB

Comic summary: The Raven and The Reaper is about Raven, a boy who was born with the ability to see death itself- the Grim Reaper. One day he wakes up only to find his parents brutally murdered with no one but the Reaper looming above them. Coming to the conclusion that it is responsible for his parents' death, Raven decides to seek revenge on the creature he believes robbed him of his loved ones.
Additional information:- The story is a thematically driven drama/mystery/hard-fantasy- While I currently don't know how long this story will be- I suspect its final length will be anywhere from 100-130 chapters. (6-8 arcs) - While I am mostly looking for someone to help me write/outline the future arcs and chapters, I do need help rewriting certain bits of dialogue and certain scenes in the first arc too (first 14 chapters, 12 of which are already published).- While this story has a lot of LGBT+ main characters, that is not the main focus. The main focus is the character drama and the mystery of the story/world.- The deadlines aren't set in stone yet. But I'd like if you were available to talk to once every 1-3 days.
It's currently sitting on 12k subscribers, and I have been publishing this comic for about a year now. And while I do find my ideas and concepts for this comic very fun and interesting, I am not an experienced story writer. I have never taken a creative writing course, and I've written relatively little in general. Which is why I realized that it's about time I get a partner to help me write this story.
This is a paid collaboration. While I don't know what are the average prices for hiring a writing partner, here's what I offer:- help with outline of the whole story (simplistic outline) - $25- help with outlining an arc (complete/detailed outline) - $50 (we will go arc by arc though- so by the end, it will be around $400 for all the arcs)- help with scripting a chapter (full script) - $15-$35 depending on the length (I won't always need help with scripting a chapter though)- help with proof-reading my scripts - $10- help with character analysis - $15-$35 per character depending in their importance/complexity
These prices aren't set in stone completely though! Also I won't pay all at once! Before every writing discussion/session I will pay the amount needed for the things we do that day!

63,Need a little help with perspective (+foreshortening),Answered,[],"I'm working on a ""big"" art piece and struggling a bit with its composition. I'd really appreciate some tips on how to fix it.

20201208-christmaseve-sketch-help.png600x960 357 KB

The green line is the ""eye line"", more or less. I wanted to do make this a POV kind of composition, like, it's seen through the eyes of the POV character (and it's their hand), but also a tall shot, with the Christmas tree visible (which is around 4-5 m tall) and after many struggles, and even trying to reproduce the scene with Sketchup... I came to think I can't make these go together and look plausible.
What I think (and have no idea if this is correct):- This shot, with the tree and all, and character standing in this exact place would be impossible unless there was a hypothetical camera panning up (which would work in animation, but this isn't) or the pov was placed much higher.- Even if the pov character was looking up, I don't know if this would be possible. Also, maybe there's some different issue I am not seeing? ...Am I just overthinking it?  
Things that maybe could help avoid the problem, but I honestly don't know:- Getting rid of the POV character, and placing the ""eye line"" much higher up... but would this really solve it? idk- Changing the composition to horizontal (would want to rearrange the background in that case tho...)
Bottom line: I'm very confused, this goes beyond my understanding of perspective, please help me. (Apologies if my sketch or explanations are unclear... I tried.)
Bonus round: Foreshortening!- Does this kind of foreshortening on the arm & hands look believable enough? Is there something I need to change? This is honestly my best attempt, from photo reference... Still doesn't look that good to me tho. ","[""I can't see any problems with it, tbh. The view works with the large tree, and really you'd only have to change where the person in the picture is if they, the one shown, is extremely tall, or if the person that we're looking through the eyes of is extremely short. \nLooks great!"", 'Hmm, not sure about the hand, but I think it should be a little larger. It is stretched out towards the viewer and is in the foreground, i.e. should be larger. When I used to draw a similar viewer oriented pose, I was guided by a set of ""follow me"" photos like this\n\nHowever, besides the hand, I would very much like to draw your attention to the background. It seems to me that the distant street lights create another horizon line and do not fit into perspective, and therefore seem to be floating in zero gravity, distorting the frame.', '\nimage.png736x604 307 KB\n\nimage.png865x960 295 KB\n\nimage.png467x677 121 KB\n\nimage.png1280x720 222 KB\n', ""The foreshortening on the POV character's hand is too small as it is closer even though it is holding the girl's hand."", 'The character in the picture is ~155 cm (5 ft), and the POV character is not much taller, so... should I change something? \n@alextsaraceYou are right about the background, I don\'t know how I haven\'t considered that before!The lights in the distance, I suppose the line below them is not really the ""ground"" as much as just a guideline for where they should start?  But I guess that\'s not the right place for these to start, it\'s not following the perspective that the grid would imply...\nSo the main thing to change would be the hands\' size? (Wait, was I really overthinking the perspective? ) They do look too small to me but any attempt to make them bigger just ended up somehow... not working lol.', ""Changing the POV hand size would cause the girl's hand to change size to compensate.....unless she has small hands."", 'I can\'t say for sure, but I think some of the ""off feeling"" might be due to how elements are being scaled. This is something I struggle with a lot so I\'m particularly sensitive to it  I did this really quick and crude redline/overaly to try and illustrate what I mean:\n\nimage.png270x667 100 KB\n\nThe red lines are just locking down the horizon line and vanishing point based on the floor grid you have laid out. It appears to be slightly higher than the green line, but not by much.\nNext I extended the canvas downward a bit to estimate how tall the whole girl is in dark blue. It\'s useful to see her full body for an exercise like this so you can scale her whole ""footprint"" and not have to guesstimate as you move back in space to where her legs will be visible farther back.\nThen I simplified her form into a rectangular box (light blue) that can more easily be understood in perspective, and lastly I scaled her back to the same depth as the front-most light posts (the purple line between the lightposts is just showing where they are relatively, and the blue box with the magenta outline is where the character would land in that spot if you follow the vanishing point back from her foreground ""box"". Lastly the magenta boxes I roughed in on top of the girl box was just to show roughly how many girls tall the light posts (and tree) are shown currently. \nAt the moment the light posts appear to be about 3.5 to 4 (I think some of my rectangles are longer than others LOL) girls tall and the tree is ~4-5 girls tall. Of course in art things can be whatever size you want, but I wonder if they look a bit off because typically they might be more like 2-3 people tall?\n\nWith another very quick and sloppy edit, here\'s what it might look like if the background element scaling was a little less extreme:\n\nimage.png460x691 176 KB\n \nI left the magenta boxes and old top point of the tree to show the difference a bit. Again though, that\'s only if the stuff in the back isn\'t supposed to be really super huge, sometimes that is fun and looks cool too  In cases where you do want to emphasize just how huge stuff in the back is, though, you can always consider adding a 2nd (or 3rd) vanishing point up above the tall stuff and converging elements to that as well. typically you hear about that sort of vanishing point in 3-point perspective, but you can actually use them in 1 or 2 point as well as the single or 2nd point.\n\nimage.png420x748 200 KB\n\nThis produces a much more exaggerated and dramatic effect which isn\'t always appropriate, but is great if you really wanna push how incredibly massive something is. An imposing tree like that decked out with all sorts of lights and decorations might look really cool @u@', ""I think I see a few issues:\n1) The far away lamp posts seem to have a different horizon line? Unless that's a wall? I'd consider moving them downto give a stronger sense of depth2) The character is placed too low based on where you put the vanishing line. If she were actually standing there, we'd be looking at her from the top down, almost bird's eye view. Given that we're actually seeing her mostly straight on, the center of her body should be at the eye line. It took me a while to get this too, but just because it's the eye line doesn't mean you line up the charater's eyes there. XD3) When playing with perspective, it's crazy how much the proportions will change. In the redraw I did for you below, notice how big the hand in the foreground is compared to if her hand was far away, and the hand in the middle. Even though I don't know if this is perfectly correct, our eye is actually more forgiving to the exaggeration than not. The reason that it would look weird for you to enlarge the hand and nothing else is because the arms also get bigger as they get closer to the camera. 4) This is just a suggestion for the composition. Since the main action is the hand grabbing, I wouldn't place it in the lower tenth of the image as you have it now...

Do you look like you're holding someone's hand? (Personally, I do not.)\nEven if it's possible to be holding someone's hand while in that pose, this is art, so that's not the point. ^^; The point is to get the viewer to believe it, and more effective foreshortening would help with that. At the very least, the subject's hand should either be turned toward the viewer or actively grasping/being grasped by the viewer's hand, to show the interaction.\nIf you're going to go the traditional route and do extreme foreshortening on the arm so that the hand is in roughly the same place, I feel I should warn you that both hands will have to get a lot bigger, and you may have to move the subject up in the shot in order for the viewer's hand to show. And since you're worried about the positions of the subject vs. the background objects, that would become a factor there, too."", 'Thank you, this is extremely helpful! \nI was not intending to make the tree & lights huge, more like... normal sized, yeah.

XD\nWell, the ""eye line"" here is the eyes of the POV character who\'s probably not much taller than the girl, and standing quite close before her, so I figured the horizon line matches up with it (though the grid is a little off from there, yeah). If I cropped the image just above her head, the composition probably wouldn\'t look so off? Hmmm... I\'m still confused, will give it more thinking.\n@DokiDokiTsuna  Hmm I know art doesn\'t need to be perfectly accurate, and I\'m not going for perfect accuracy either.

Maybe I'll try to do that keeping the rest of these tips in mind.\n Exactly so  In this case you may want to move them a little closer together first (maybe move them each inward like 3-4 of your floor grid lines) and then you can do the same thing I did with scaling the girl back but in reverse- draw a perspective box encompassing each of the distant light poles and draw a line from the vanishing point hitting each of the corners of the box. Then when you reach the point in the foreground that you want it placed, you re-complete the box from those guides.. Here's another crude example of that in action. This used the light poles at the size that I showed them in my 2nd draw over above (the one without the high vanishing point).\n\nimage.png379x602 158 KB\n\nCan just barely see where I moved the dark purple original light pole in closer in the back (it's conflicting with the green tree lines a bit) but that way when you project the perspective points forward they're still in the shot and not off to the side of the canvas. I picked where to locate them in space by selecting the high point of the pole that I wanted and drawing a line straight down from there to see where it hit the lower perspective guide (in this case you can't see it well because it directly overlapped the red line on the right where the center of the base is). I just free handed the left light pole in this case but theoretically you could do the same process to locate it more accurately, but I think it's close enough "", ""I could be in the minority, but I'm not a fan of the background symmetry.\nI get that you're using it as a framing device but a little asymmetry could help the perspective by staggering the distance of the lightpoles.\nJust my opinions.""]",12/10/2020 14:09

65,Is there a rule on Tapas regarding creating multiple accounts to surpass milestones quickly?,Answered,[],"I hope this doesn't come across as rude, but I'm really confused.
So, I just came across a novel by a creator who has the Support turned up, which is pretty normal. But, since the story I checked has only 20+ subs, I decided to check the creator's page. There are a lot, like I mean a lot, of incomplete stories on their page. I checked one by one, a lot of them were 1 - 5 subs, and most of them were < 25, to the point I really thought that the accumulation of subs determined the 250 milestone.
But, I finally came to the one with 250+ subs, and decided to check the subs. Most of the subs on the first page were random alphabets of a name. And even on the last page, most accounts only subbed to this specific story. So, my initial guess is that... the creator possibly created a lot of account to sub their story to reach the milestone.
Does Tapas have a regulation relating this? Or is that allowed?

For the LGBTQ+ genre. Is it okay to mark a story in that genre if it just features LGBTQ+ protagonists, or is the genre primarily focused on characters' experiences as LGBTQ+ people?

Like if a story has a superhero who's a gay man, but his relationship with his partner is more of a minor background plot with the primary focus of the story being his work as a superhero, would that still fit the genre? Or would it only fit if him being gay was the primary focus.

Basically re: what darthmangoose said. I did my first comic here on tapas with traditional linework and digital colors and the process of scanning and prepping the art for each page ended up being more hassle than worth. I went through a bunch of different methods over the run of the 70 page comic-\nat first I would use mechanical pencil, ink over it, and erase the pencils before scanning (much like when I do traditional marker art). I found that it was hard to rid the paper of all of the eraser shavings though and so a lot of my scans would pick those up which led to a lot of pre-coloring editing. Erasing also just takes a lot of time, especially on the big 11x17 paper I used.\nSo then I tried moving to non-photo blue colored pencil for my pencils because you don't have to erase it afterwards. That part was big time savings and no more eraser shavings on the scans was nice! But I found that I had a hard time seeing my sketches clearly because the color was so light and so I ended up having a difficult time inking and missed a lot of little details.\nFinally in the end I would do the sketch digitally and then print them off on 2 sheets of printer paper and use a light box to ink (at this point there weren't that many pages left so I wanted to finish the comic off with the same line quality, otherwise I would have just digitally inked).\nAll throughout this too, I only have a small scanner so each page required 4 scans to digitize and then I would have to piece them together (thankfully Photoshop does this automatically for me tho). \nThe reason I went through all this trouble was because at the beginning I felt the same- my digital art skills were shaky and I especially didn't like how my lineart turned out on the computer, so I felt it was faster to get nice looking drawings traditionally even with all the extra steps. While I was doing the comic though I decided to practice my digital art skills on the side. After... maybe a year of that I felt like my digital art skills were finally on par or better with my traditional art ones. Now, 2 years later, I can make pages digitally much MUCH faster than traditionally.\nNot only do I not have to go through all those extra steps, but I also have access to all of the digital shortcuts like undo, copy paste, being able to rescale and rotate things rather than completely redraw, etc. I could never imagine going back to traditional for anything other than standalone illustrations or very short comics. Anything that's moderately long, the time savings on digital is just too great."", ""Thank you for sharing.

Thank you again, I'll see what I can do with what you mentioned. "", ""This is a very great question and a valid concern. I want you to know that your worries are 100% justified. A lot of artists seem to mistake digital art as this holy grail that will make art easier and faster to finish. That is not at all the case. I'm working on a not-yet-published comic project with an artist friend of mine and we pretty much agreed that doing traditional and tweaking pages digitally is the best way for us to get in the groove. I totally agree with my artist's assessment, so that's what we've been doing now. But it is definitely subjected to changes as we go along the way. I suggest creating pages with and focus on just one medium first (either trad or digi) then if you find one of them much more comfortable to you, commit to it."", ""It all depends on if your doing color or black and white. If your doing color then digital is the way to go. As for black and white it depends on your preference. The traditional route gives less room for error and you might have to get use to a lot of erasure marks. The inking might take longer however the benefits of traditional drawing is that everything feels more natural and you have more control. It also builds up confidence in your strokes because the final inking process forces you to commit. The digital route might be more expensive since you might have to invest in software programs or drawing tablets. However there are free softwares available but don't expect the quality to be the same as the one you have to pay for. Me personally I do a mixture of both but most of my drawing and inking is done on paper but I transfer it to vectors to sharpen it out on illustrator. As for scanning, for convenience I recommend a phone scanner like cam scanner. Once you do that you can use image trace on illustrator to transfer it to vectors."", 'I’ve been drawing comics for a while now and there was a chunk of years i tried with purely going digital but I could never match the speed I have with traditional.

77,I can’t decide on a career path,Answered,[],"Like anyone, I would like to live as a functional adult life once I get ready to leave my parents'. I LOVE art, and ((indie)) animation seems nice as well. I'm invested in writing my webcomic series, as well. That's been a goal for such a long time. But webcomics, for the most part, don't pay the bills. I worry that it will knock the joy out of my hobby. So, I looked for other options. It'd be nice to be a director... but I'm not sure if my personality would be compatible with such a job. Hmmm.. then what about game design? I love video games, but after a long thinking process, I didn't have any interest in making it. Psychology was only an option for like 3 seconds. Business is the only slight appealing one. But even then, would I be happy? Art is a super competitive genre. And paying for a VERY expensive art school is scary. I love to write stories. I want to be creative. But I'm not getting any younger. I'll have to decide QUICK. Or else I'll be making a youtube channel lmao.","[""How old are you? I'm gonna assume teenager or young adult so the rest of the post is geared towards that:\nIf you're a teen and still in high school I suggest exploring your interests, try out new stuff every now and then, maybe for just a week or two.I tried out weird stuff like suddenly becoming an electronic musician, or learning German for a week, or learning Japanese for a week, writing a bunch of short stories of different genres for fun. I made a bunch of games with Game Maker, I studied different subjects like Psychology and Government in school, and eventually I saw what stuck and what interested me the most. (It was Japanese and story writing.)\nAfter that, consider community college; regular university is real expensive (if you are American) and art school is even more so. But at community college you can take much cheaper classes in a calmer setting and even take different classes for subjects you don't know much about so that you can see what exactly it is that interests you most as a career. You can do this at actual university as well, but that's gonna riddle you with debt (which most people do, including me, so hey go for it I guess). Universities will have many more class options available as well. You don't NEED classes to learn and study and figure yourself out, but honestly, not many people are good at learning without a structured setting...\nRather than thinking about a specific job just yet, maybe just think of a field. You've got a few listed here so far. Writing is a varied field filled with many jobs; art is extremely varied with jobs everywhere; game design is a pretty specific field but design in general is useful in many places; business is a bit TOO broad but the skills you learn will be useful. Once you dive deeper into any of these fields you can start to figure out maybe what you might like do actually do. There's always jobs open in all of these fields, so that part shouldn't be a worry just yet."", 'Can we see a portfolio of work you\'ve been making in your free time so far? Because I think the main thing you should look at for an art career is ""what am I so motivated to make, I\'ll make it even when nobody\'s paying me?"".', 'So, this isn\'t going to be everyone\'s experience, but I went to school for game design because upon finishing high school, because I didn\'t really know what I wanted to do so I took the ""childhood dream"" route. That turned out to be a mistake; I hated art school and couldn\'t stand most of my classmates, and the thought of them being my future coworkers really put me off, so I left after about a year to pursue something else. Art is still very much a hobby for me, but my career wound up going in a different direction and I wouldn\'t have it any other way.\nAnyway, I wouldn\'t recommend art school unless you\'re absolutely sure about it; you can learn TONS about art, animation, game design etc. for much cheaper online and a degree in it isn\'t really necessary, other than to possibly make connections.\nAlso, it is totally, totally okay to not know what you want to do yet, or to change your mind later. People change careers all the time, so don\'t panic too much--but I would definitely either put off college for awhile or go the community college route to save some money (granted, this is assuming you\'re American). You mentioned an interest in business; a business degree is super versatile and you can take it a lot of different places, so that\'s always a decent option.\nFinally, on the note of not thinking you have the right personality for certain jobs--don\'t sweat that too much. I\'m a bonafide introvert who still has trouble talking to people, and I accidentally fell into a security/customer service job and wound up being really good at it!

See what are the skills you need and the best ways to develop them.\nWish you the best on your decision! ', 'Unless you live in an area’s that has a major gaming studio , I would recommend against a game design major. I went to a university with a gaming department and there was a pressure within digital art groups to major or minor in gaming. However I was also aware that EA recently closed their local headquarters in our area and a former employee was working as a professor at the school. Work crunch and overtime is brutal in the industry but there has been changes in recent years to form unions and better work environments. My brother who was originally going to go into gaming instead did Computer Science and got a good job right after he graduated.\nFor animation, make sure the school has a good department. I made the mistake of going to one that bragged about having one and it was literally 2 basis classes for beginners, it taught me nothing professional. I ended up focusing on learning to paint and video editing, so I would not feel like I wasted my time there.', 'I was in a similar boat heading out of highschool, I had no idea whatsoever what I really wanted to do. I had a childhood dream of winding up in animation, but was never very serious about pursuing that. I kinda wanted to still wind up in an art/design based profession because drawing is what I had always been passionate about but I also didn\'t want to major in art because I had similar concerns about my ability to ""make it"" in such a competitive field- the absolute last thing I wanted was to wind up with a degree that wouldn\'t get to make use of after paying so much money to earn it. \nSo, I ended up doing some research into design-based/adjacent professions that had a more concrete career path. There are some options, like graphic design for example, that are still niche, but at least a popular niche that gets used frequently in day to day life. The option I ended up discovering and going with was architectural design- i had never really been that interested in architecture prior to college but after trying the intro classes sophomore year (after feeling the time crunch of needing to find something) I found it a lot of fun and it fit my criteria pretty well. It\'s design based, but also a career that had a pretty reliable out of school job acquisition rate; you go to school, get your degree, and with that find a job or internship at an architecture office. Recently some HTML and CSS skills I picked up in the past have even been coming in handy as the architecture company I work for has been having me work to rebuild our website lol. \nAgain not saying you should necessarily try to be a graphic designer or architect necessarily, but if you\'re set on doing something creative but concerned about freelancing, do consider looking into design-oriented jobs that aren\'t necessarily just wide open in scope ', ""I think you're still young, based on your post, so there's no need to rush. Take your time getting to know yourself and you should find out what career path you should follow."", 'Before I get started, I want to give the caveat that my advice (as well as everyone\'s) is based purely on my own personal experience and won\'t necessarily work the same for you or anyone else. Hopefully, you\'re able to coalesce all of the advice into something that works for your circumstances.\nFor most of my life, art was a hobby that I would have really liked to spend my whole life on but never considered as a realistic career option. So I lived my life as if I was going to have to end up ""some suit in an office who gripes about who he could have been."" Which meant I pursued the ""safe"" path - did well enough in school to get into a decent college, selected the college that seemed to be the best deal for my budget (in my case, it was a well regarded business school that gave me a full ride scholarship), and stumbled into a boring, but decently paid and comfortable, office job a few months after graduating with a business degree. \nAnd the entire time I was always second guessing myself - I would look at my peers who followed their dreams and headed straight into art school, or they would be super ambitious and go for the prestige careers like doctor, lawyer, banker, etc. But when I would objectively look at where I was - I had no debts (thanks to my scholarship), a low stress job (even though nobody would find it as impressive as ""med student"" or ""VP at a bank""), and I had enough free time and income to pursue my passions on my own time (drawing, writing, taking improv classes, doing stand-up open mics) - I was still advancing towards my dreams even though I couldn\'t post something on social media to ""prove"" to everyone that I was. Meanwhile, some of those same peers I compared myself to were extremely stressed, overworked, and questioning their path but reluctant to change it because they\'ve already invested so much into it. \nAnyway, less about my life story, the advice this amounts to is this - if you\'re uncertain about your career path, do the safe option: pursue an education that won\'t break your bank and try to get a degree in something with decent job prospects. In my experience, this could be a business degree (e.g. accounting, finance, marketing) or something involving computers/coding. This sort of education has a lot of generalized use that can lead to decent pay. There may be some fear that the people who do really well in these fields are overworked and have no free time, but you don\'t have to be one of those people who wants to excel in these careers, especially if your aspirations are in a completely different field. You can do just well enough in a job that covers your basic necessities but doesn\'t demand too much of your life that you have no time for your passions.\nI know this isn\'t the most romantic path - artistic types always seem to idealize the ""struggle"" of being a creative - but it\'s been working wonders for me, so far. Unless something crazy happens in the next couple of years, I\'m probably well past the point of ""up-and-coming young talent who comes out of nowhere!"" and I\'m fine with that, I\'m taking things at a comfortable pace. And the little secret about those young talents is that they usually come from well-connected and/or wealthy families - they usually aren\'t ""discovered"" by some enterprising agent slumming in a bar. For regular folks, you should really get comfortable with the prospect of not ""hitting it big"" as soon as you dive into the industry, and the likelihood that if you do end up being successful, you might not know it until significantly down the line. In the meantime, you need to find a reliable way to keep yourself alive.', ""If you're super passionate about art and comics and it's something you want to seriously pursue and you recognize the monetary limitations, look into animation maybe? I see it as an extension of my hobby that would provide me the learning environment I need as well as stable income while I work on comics on the side."", '\n\nHazumirein:\nAnyway, I wouldn\'t recommend art school unless you\'re absolutely sure about it; you can learn TONS about art, animation, game design etc. for much cheaper online and a degree in it isn\'t really necessary, other than to possibly make connections.\nThis reminds me of a wise quote from Lindsay Ellis, ""Don\'t go to film school. Watch Youtube videos.""', ""You have to search for what kind of lifestyles you'll get from each career you're considering.\nLet money and fame aside for a while (well, keep the money idea, but not that much), and see which career gives you a lifestyle you can live with after finishing your studies as well as which values define you and which career has the most fitted values (consider the school values too).\nNo career is completely made for us, we have to adapt to them at some levels, and it's usually hard. Choose the one were you have to adapt the less."", 'Something that most people won’t say: you don’t have to know  \nI’m a firm believer that all of our experiences, both positive and negative, lead us to where we need to be in life. We don’t have to know as soon as we enter college what to do with “the rest of our lives” and it is REALLY okay to change things up if you don’t like them! \nTry new things out, take some fun extra classes, check our videos or blogs from people in career paths you are interested in. And then, if you aren’t happy with where you are in a few months or years, change it up. Our parents and grandparents generations were taught to get a job and stick with it until they retire, but that’s not an option for many of us and the world doesn’t operate like that anymore, either. Utilizing various skills from a variety of jobs can be a fantastic thing. I used my customer service skills ALL THE TIME when I was working as an electrician and it made my life so much easier compared to some of my coworkers because I already had that skill. They seem so unrelated, but it was really helpful.

I generally know the guidelines for posting mature content on webtoon but the details are still a bit unclear to me. I'm thinking about a story that shows the relationship between a succubs girl and young church man in the Renaissance period, just by this you can tell that it's not gonna be a very ""innocent"" story, i'm planning to turn this into a comedy-one like, but yeah, the succubus characters has her breast totally uncovered in her original form and there are quite many sex scene (though i don't have a problem with censor them). My main concern is the ""graphical nudity"", this comic idea is basically an ecchi, and i'm not sure if just labeling the comic for ""mature content"" will be enough....","['First of all, that will be an amazing story. Depending on the religion and denomination of your ""church man"" (I assume he will be Christian since you are referring to a church), you will be able to play on very raw emotions of guilt, repressed desire, need and self-immolation that will highly enhance the sensuality of your sex scenes.\nWhere I am concerned, art shouldn\'t be leashed up. If in literature there is a genre called erotica that permits the full focus of a whole book to be on sexual relationships, then I do not see why some tastefully (your drawings seem very tasteful for what I have seen) drawn sexual scenes would be any less acceptable.\nRather than wondering how far you are willing to go where the depiction of the act itself is concerned, I would rather think about how to render it sensitive taking into account the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of religious leaders of different religions and denominations. I assume you want to go for the Roman Catholic priest (as opposed to a Protestant preacher, a Orthodox Christian or Greek Catholic Priest) since it is expected he has pledged a vow of celibacy. At the same time, sexual abuse at the hands of Roman Catholic priests has been very mediatized and your idea could bring back bad memories to people or ruffle some feathers.\nYou seem to be a kind, sensitive person, so I would tell you to go as far as your moral compass permits you but to keep in mind that some people will maybe need for you to add a disclaimer and to offer some emotional support.\nI wish you a lot of luck with your work! I am sure it will be great!', 'The only mature content in my story is gore and explicit language.', ""Wow it's already enticing  Looking forward to this story\nWhile I'm not sure the risks on sexual themes on webtoons though but I'd like to see your story made"", 'Hello!!

Just keep in mind that i have the perfect title for the story: Blasfemia.....so yeah, this is a comedy but still somehow ""scandalous"". One another thing that concerns me is the overall religion theme, because in a comic where there are a church man and a Succubus, from someone who\'s not a devoted like me, it would turn out quite ""satirical"" (maybe it\'s too strong like a word) of course i don\'t want to unintentionally criticize anything, i respect other\'s people religions and opinions about them, but the comical part is about this devil outgoing girl being quite sarcastic about it  for the sake of ridiculous. BUT i might want to criticize how much the catholic church was corrupted and twisted during that period (i got only inspired by the Venetian Renaissance period for a series of fitting reasons) and the critiques always come from the devil\'s point of view, who, in this story, is way more intelligent than common humans (since she\'s been living with them since almost the beginning) and know things that are not written in certain books of official documents, and she think that the religion of that time is too strict and at the same time hyprocrital to their worshippers, still she\'s the ""necessary evil"" that the town needs in order to be kept in control (she works like a prostitute in order to satisfy men that otherwise would make the city a living sin of uncontrolled sexual desires and rape cases) ...in this scenerio we have this young priest, fresh-out-of-the-oven that arrive in this fiction Venice town with the best intentions and goal for his honest career but instead he finds himself in the mot sinful city of Italy. \nThis is would be sense of the plot, more or less, in a comical way though.', ""I see, in the comic i'm posting right now, there is a scene where the heroine is totally naked and some implied sex panels but weirdly it wasn't taken down °° therefore i asked because i don't know with how much i can get away with it...my comic was also featured in the risintlg star category once!

I emailed Webtoons and they did put my pages back up, so the content of those pages were in line with their policy. The problem with pages getting taken down is that Webtoons doesn\'t notify you when it happens, they\'re just listed in red as ""removed"" in the \'edit\' tab. \nI notice that your webtoons page also has an advisory attached to it, so I\'d guess your content wouldn\'t be removed by webtoons since you\'ve already labeled it for a mature audience.', 'I see.

Character sheets: Solved.","['Nothing disengages me like a character sheet. . . or multiple. It make me feel, as a reader, that you don\'t trust yourself enough to weave descriptions and background information into the story in a clear and concise way. If a character is a ""ghost or a reaper,"" I would hope something like that is plot relevant and can be explained later. The trigger warning is fine, even explaining the the story is a slow burn is excusable, but is the multiple episodes (or even one episode) worth of character sheets and background exposition necessary? I don\'t think it is. The story is a slow burn, that mean things are going to take awhile. You have them time to place those elements in the story. I or any other reader shouldn\'t be waiting to the seventh episode to get into the actual literature of the story. If the character sheets and exposition is so necessary, create a new novel for them and link them off in the description. Inform the readers that more information and details about the world and characters can be found elsewhere, not info-dumped at the top of the story before the reader has the chance to care about the characters they\'re reading about.

Someone could be the most attentive and careful reader and still feel as though they\'ve wasted their time reading what you or what anybody else has written. That\'s not on the reader. It\'s not really on the writer either, but don\'t start pointing fingers. And even if you have worked hard on them, readers don\'t have to sympathize with your efforts. It\'s better if they do, great even, but don\'t always expect it. I can\'t say anything on the actual literature, I didn\'t read it but I did notice a few typos.

93,"Hosting your own site (Tumblr, Wix, or?)",Answered,[],"Hi hey hello howdy
 I'm new here-- but I've been lurking the forum for a little while and thought I'd ask a question thats been on my mind pertaining to webcomic-ing. I hope this wasn't already asked/discussed--- but if so-- SORRY 
BUT, on to my question;
What platform do you find is best to host your webcomic independently? Meaning, how do you go about making ""your own site"" for just your comics content. 
I am personally thinking of two options. 

Tumblr: I've seen a lot of creators use tumblr as their main comic posting hub-- where they get a custom url or they life-hack it so the url (that seems custom) goes directly to pages which the url is not necessarily custom. The pros with that being is that its a familiar thing to work with and theres like.... 5000 tumblr layouts you can modify and even a few JUST for comic posting. 
Hiring a webdesigner; Now, personally, I am POOP at code/designing/etc.. So I feel like gettin' someone that knows the ropes to help me out would be best.  I really like the idea of haveing a website of my own without haveing to use a.. ""platform"" of sorts?? I know there are a lot of other more techincal benefits of going about hosting your comic this way vs tumblr. 

I'm teetering between these two ideas. Both have pros and cons.
idk! I just mostly wanted to get perspective from creators that have thier own site. My comic is currently still in the works, this isn't anything immediate for me. I tend to think very far ahead I guess? which idk is a good thing or bad thing in this case--ANYWAYS THIS POST IS SO RAMBLY OH MY GOD IM SORRY. 
I apologise if what I'm asking isn't clear or that my explanations are confuseing. Anyways! thank you to anyone that gives some insight on this ","[""I used to use a Tumblr for my comic, but now I just use  a wordpress/comic easel with own fancy domain name and everything right here457 and I love it.\nWhile Tumblr kind of worked for me while I used it,, it was always a very boring and generic looking site. The customization options were rather limited. The plus, however is that it was very simple to use, it took me under an hour t get a comic Tumblr set up. Still, I could never stand how unprofessional it looked so I eventually switched to getting my own site and just using Wordpress.\nNow for getting your own site, I don't think hiring a web designer is really necessary if you're willing to do some tinkering. I knew literally nothing about webdesign/html while making my site, and I think it came out pretty decent, and I only had to write like half a line of code. The Comic Easel plug in I used with Wordpress already gave a lot of options for customization, and I've seen some people make pretty cool sites with it. It can take a while to learn how to use Wordpress, but once you've got the hang of it, it's pretty simple.The main con of having your own site is the cost. I think on average a domain with hosting costs around ~$50 per year, assuming you don't get insane traffic. \nOverall, I prefer having my own site a lot more now that I have one, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.

(Numbers are examples only)."", ""Och, yeah! That is exactly it!!!\nIt reminds me of my youth, when I was reading fanfiction. You come across something that appeals to you, something that at a specific moment in time corresponds to what you want to read then. And you sub it (we did not sub, back then; back then, we followed).\nBut at the end of the day, you never really get the time to read that work. Because when you do have time, something else catches your eye. And that is how you get Ghost Subs, as we call them (actually, as I call them).\nTruth is, I can't even read 2-3 series at once, taking into account I want to feel every chapters and then I need to express my feelings (in bold, because we all know how much my feelings are important - Your (sic) not that interesting, dawg. Me to myself) through comments and enter into a cycle where I can't even finish one short webcomic or novel. But the number of works I must read just accumulates and accumulates and accumulates.\nAs well, there is this something called sub-culture (you see what I did there?!) The more subs you have the greater the chance someone reads your work. So you go and sub someone else's work to induce that artist to sub you back so that your number of subs increases as to give off an impression of success! And thus continues the cycle of Sub Life on Tapas.\nWe should make a documentary about the Tapas Wildlife."", ""I think maybe 25% of my subs actually read my comic, and about 10% actively engages with it in the comments.

Some kind of hoarding thing ? It's almost comically depressing though, when you work hard on something, do your best, give it away for free, and then even most of the people who noticed your stuff, don't even wanna look at it anymore, lol.\nThe sub-for-sub thing...can't say I haven't been tempted to sub people who sub me out of sheer gratitude, but I've managed to limit my library to comics I actually enjoy. It can be a hard principle to stick to, when you get subbed by someone who's really nice and seems to genuinely like your stuff, and then you check out their thing, and your fancy isn't struck, so you don't sub....hate when that happens. Makes me feel like such a jerk.\nAll that being said, I do have two readers who subbed like 10 months ago, and who only now have started reading, liking and commenting, so that does happen too."", ""To be honest, I'm one of those binge readers XD. Usually I bookmark comics that I find appealing and if they have lots of updates already I wait until I have more time before I start reading them.

So, it's been two years since I started writing the script for my series and only recently I finally decided to make a step forward and make the manga version I've always dreamt of.

Sucked into the game | Tapas
The story follows Jason. An average guy with a nice family, a loving boyfriend, good friends, a good income, a nice house and a sneaky serial killer to catch, that might destroy it all, if Jason allows them to.





","['Okay, this comes from a fast review, but let\'s see if I can help  \nFirst: Have you interacted with others work since you started posting?\n\nBefore ask, you have to give: Give others the attention you\'re looking for and they\'ll feel more inclined to do the same for you.\nSecond: I took a look to the first chapter of ""Sneaking on piano keys"", it looks well-structured, no big errors at first sight \nThe only thing I would point to would be to retire that first ad chapter. Links to your other stories are already at the end of each chapter, so avoid throwing off possible readers that are already enticed by the summary and wanna know a bit more with an useless ad.\nThird: I took a quick look to the first chapters of ""Sucked into the game"" and I found an odd detail:\n\nThere\'s no narration in the dialogues. I spotted it right away because I have the same problem, so I write the dialogues and then I go back and include what the characters are doing and feeling. You seem to have the same problem here, you may know what the characters are doing with their hands, their expressions and other nuances, but the reader doesn\'t and that makes the dialogue loose all interest.\nThat\'s my three points of advice, hope I helped ', 'Well for one, Sneaking on Piano Keys begins with you telling the reader to look at something else even before they know if they like the story they clicked on. This story is also barely a month old on Tapas; it\'s going to take time for people to find and be interested in it. \nLet\'s look at your synopsis first.""After years of homeschooling and appointments with a psychologist, Max has finally been considered ready to go back into the outside world, and everything goes well for a while, but then karma and puberty decide to strike him down and now he has to pretend to be normal or he might end locked up for ""being crazy"", which isn\'t easy when the dead (many of which are mangled in some manner making them horrifying to look at) are begging you for help.\nYou have some overly long sentences and some unnecessary information. Information the reader could and should learn about while reading. Here\'s my edit:\n""After years of homeschooling and appointments with a psychologist, Max has finally been considered ready to go back into the outside world.  Everything goes well for a while, but then karma and puberty decide to strike him down. Now he has to pretend to be normal or he might end locked up for ""being crazy"", which isn\'t easy when the dead (many of which are mangled in some manner making them horrifying to look at) are begging you for help.\nInstead of being one long uncomfortable sentence, it\'s three more manageable sentences.\nI\'m only going to speak on the first two episodes since that sets the tone for how the story is going to go. You started the story with a character waking up, and while this isn\'t a no-no in terms of writing, it is cliche and shows inexperience. \nYou have a few typos, and your sentence structure is wildly all over the place. Again, some are distractedly too long. Others are to the point, but not in an interesting way. For example: \n""He spent the last few years taking classes at home so he wouldn\'t fall behind  the other kids of his age, studying Portuguese so he could do something as simple as ordering a pizza and he went to appointments with a psychologist to help him cope with the changes in his life"" \nThis is a paragraph in itself. It could easily be split into two or three sentences, like so: ""He spent the last few years taking classes at home so he wouldn\'t fall behind  the other kids of his age . Max studied Portuguese so he could do something as simple as ordering a pizza . He also went to appointments with a psychologist to help him cope with the changes in his life"" \nI mentioned before that it\'s cliche to start a story with the character waking up, and it is, but you can always make it more interesting to show off a character moment. Maybe instead of Max waking up on time and perfectly ready to start the day, you have tired from a sleepless, excited night. Maybe his aunt or uncle come in to wake him up, but he\'s already awake and they catch him practicing how he\'s going to introduce himself to his peers with his cat. Maybe he\'s late, and there has to be something extreme and lucky to happen for him to get to school on time. Something, anything else could work.\nI think the mention of Max needing therapy should\'ve come up later when it was plot relevant. Maybe he had a tough time at school that first day and he comes home and fiddles with the piano keys. Then there\'s the opportunity for his aunt to come in, ask him about his day. They have character moment together and the reader is informed of the psychologist. And then you can also have the aunt remind Max that he could play for rich people one day. Boom. Three birds with one scene. Literature is all about informing the reader in the most efficient and interesting way possible. (Also even if the psychologist is mentioned in the synopsis, there is a chance that someone will skip it and get right into the story.)\nThis is just a personal gripe, but I found the use of -hyphens- to show speech confusing and frustrating. If it\'s an aesthetic thing I understand, but using ""quotation marks"" is just as well and you won\'t turn off readers that way. \nI don\'t really care for Daniel\'s introduction. . . or Max\'s. Probably because I don\'t know what they look like. Maybe physical descriptions are hard for you, I can understand that. Even if that\'s the case, you should still take the time to right a sentence or two describing your characters. \nYou can easily write: ""Max was a kid of thirteen years, with tanned skin, dark brown hair and almond sea green eyes. His round nose scrunched up due to the cat hair in the air, which caused his scarred hands to brush it away.""\nAnd while those sentence may not describe your actual character, it does give whomever reads a clearer idea of Max in their heads while also raising some questions, such as: Why is his skin tanned and why does he have scarred hands? Is it because of his cat, or is it because of something else?\nThe dialogue is curt, uninteresting and stilted. The conversation between Daniel and Max isn\'t the worst but I feel as though it could have been executed better.\nLastly, I don;t really understand who Max is. Now may that gets better as chapter goes on, but as for right now, I, and anyone who reads the first two episodes, doesn\'t have even a little bit of an idea of what t expect from this character. \nI\'m not going to read Sucked into the Game. I\'ll just say, if you find any similarities in that story and Sneaking on Piano Keys, then refer to the critique I gave here. There\'s not a lot of intrigue for these stories from my own perspective, even though I like the premises. I mean I loved ParaNorman which has a similar premise to SOPK and I like murder mysteries which is similar to SITG. It\'s a matter of execution. You\'re very early on in terms of posting to a platform so as you get better you\'ll have more eyes on your work. \nGood luck and I hope this helps.', 'Thank you for the review, I\'ll review my writing them. But I feel as I should give a few clarifications:\n1: The story is set in Portugal, we don\'t\' do the ""putting the new student on the stand and force them to talk about themselves"" here. Here, when you\'re the new student, you sit, and pray that no one goes ""hey that\'s my seat, get out"".\n2: The narrator is omnipresent, but in other to keep the action fluid I avoid stopping it for descriptions. The readers will receive hints of a character face, etc. if another character is thinking about them or analyzing them or if it can be fit in a description of a movement.

I know different languages use different things for speech, but I feel like your story starts in the wrong spot, so it comes off like a summary. You talk about how he learns to cope with whatever he went through via the psychologist's descriptions, but there's no hook, no intrigue.Try starting off with some action like: Max Costelllo stared out the car window as his mother drove into his new school. It was a tall red-bricked building surrounded by trimmed green grass. It radiated a sense of authority. It seemed like the sort of place where one knew the teachers didn't allow the students to get away with any form of bullshit. As the car slowed near the drop-off zone, bright-eyed students navigated through the maze of vehicles in the parking lot and pushed their way through the glass double doors of the front entrance. They wore uniforms. They all sported black vests, but while the boys wore baggy khaki pants, the girls wore plaid skirts. Max sunk lower into his seat, wanting to disappear. His throat was tight with worry. His hand tapped his thigh. He liked to keep his hands busy. He found it prevented him from thinking about other things.... Things that could destroy one's sanity.\nTry to be subtle like that.

106,Need help with a trans character!,Answered,[],"So, I'm writing story with a trans girl in it.I already did some research on my own, but I'm still left with some questions about how exactly her body would be like.
As far as I understand(still, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong please):- Transitioning may leave trans woman sterile (even without the bottom surgery).- Trans woman have less testosterone then cis woman, and therefore have less muscle mass, and are weaker then cis woman.- Hormones will make facial and chest hair disappear, but will no affect ""private"" and armpit hair.- Even though hormones will give them boobs and redistribute fat (giving them a more feminine silhouette), they still need to get boob surgery (because their breasts look more like man boobs then actual boobs) and a surgery to get larger hips.- Trans woman may end up developing breast cancer during their transition.
Things you should know about the character:- She started her transition before going through male puberty.
Now here are my questions:- Would the hormones affect her dick's growth and development? (I know she'll most likely be sterile and she'll still have ""private"" hair, but like, will it stay prepubescent forever or be unable to become stiff?)- Will her boobs development just like cis grill's? (she never really became a man, so... IDK, in my head it just seems like she wouldn't have man boobs).
Thank you in advance for any help you can provide me with.","[""Estrogen/androgen blockers don't work the same on every person because everyone's biology is different. I guess at a younger age it has more of an impact on biological sex, but that's as much as I know, maybe someone else has a better experience in chat."", ""Wow okay there's.... a lot here to break down.\nI'm out right now but will type out a full reply soon, as soon as I get to my pc. I am a trans man, not a trans woman, but I know enough about the topic to give you some useful info."", 'I\'m trans masc so I can\'t help with all of these, but I know some from my hormone research.Also... be careful with what\'s relevent to your story. Your readers probably do not need to know the nitty gritty of your character\'s bodyhair and genetalia. Even if you need to know for art reasons, be careful not to get too... Bill Nye the genetalia guy about it in story.\nHormones will make facial and chest hair disappear, but will no affect ""private"" and armpit hair.Nope. Testosterone will help you grow hair, but estrogen will not reduce it. However, since your character started hormones young, she may not have gotten some \'male pattern\' hair with puberty. Most trans women who start later in life have to use other methods to stop hair growth. (pretty much all the same methods cis women with unwanted hair use)What does change is hair texture, often becoming softer and finer. Less testosterone also means less chance of balding.\n- Even though hormones will give them boobs and redistribute fat , they still need to get boob surgery (because their breasts look more like man boobs then actual boobs) and a surgery to get larger hips.Mixed. Nobody ""needs"" any surgery. Plenty of cis women have boobs that look like \'man boobs\' and what an individual woman\'s look like is going to depend on her genetics, body type, and other factors.Trans women may be more likely to have certain kinds of chests, and more likely to be bothered by it, but, at the end of the day, whether they \'need\' surgery is just the same as a cis woman who doesn\'t like the size or shape of her breasts.\n- Trans woman may end up developing breast cancer during their transition.Cis men can also get breast cancer. Having more breast tissue, by weight or hormones, does increase that risk.\nA lot of your questions are pretty personal physical questions, so I really hope you\'ll handle your character\'s anatomy with respect. I don\'t think cis authors shouldn\'t write trans women (or transmasc/nonbinary authors, I don\'t know your life), but I do think the sort of story that gets into the details of genital development is the sort of story left to trans authors.\n\nwill it stay prepubescent forever or be unable to become stiff?Don\'t want to get into too much of this stuff because it feels weird to me, but did want to explain one thingShe is going through puberty.The dick and the clitoris are actually the same structure. When hormones kick in before a child is born, they define how that structure forms. Like body hair, this is a one way process. The structure grows on T, but does not shrink on E (well, it does change in some ways, but it\'s more about make)And, just like the penis, blood flows to the clitoris when aroused. A hormonal shift doesn\'t mean the structure no longer works, it means it responds like a clitoris instead of a penis.\nAt the end of the day, if you want to draw a hairless trans woman... we don\'t need to know how she got there. Most cis women don\'t have smooth legs either, but we don\'t need to be informed they shave to justify not drawing leg hair. Focus on building her as a well rounded character, don\'t worry so much about her cup size.', 'Thank you for your help.\nAlso just to clarify.\nDuring my research I looked up stuff like tucking, and in my brain it just makes sense that the more you have to hide, the more trouble you\'ll have hiding it, and one of brain cells was just wondering if the hormones would affect that, so I just wanted to know what she will be dealing with, like ""will she need a gaff or will she be able to make do with two pairs of panties?"".\nAnd the breast thing, well I wanted to know if she would need a surgery or not. Not that I\'m planning to make the series last enough for the readers to see her as an adult. But it was something I needed to know for a possible scene I\'m thinking of.\nOnce again, thank you!\n(And don\'t worry. I\'m not going to write explicit descriptions of her body or anything of the sort.)', 'Let\'s start off by making one thing clear: Transitioning looks different for everyone. Transitions can include any combination of the following, ranging all the way from all/several of them to just one/a few:\nNon medical transitioning- Voice therapy- Name change- Change of pronouns- Changing the legal gender marker (The one on your ID. Do note that in many countries, we are still not allowed to do this without having gone through some amount of medical transition. Which kinds of medical transition is required varies. Many countries also require a ""real life experience"", where you live with your transition results for a period of time - usually months to years - before they allow gender marker change)- Clothing, hairstyle, other non permanent visual changes- Mannerisms\nI\'ll place this inbetween the categories, as it is technically permanent but not as invasive as most of the options under medical transition: Laser hair removal. Many trans women use this to eradicate unwanted facial and body hair.\nMedical transition- Hormone replacement therapy (estrogen for trans women, testosterone for trans men, hormone stoppers for young people awaiting evaluation. Nonbinary people may also go through hormone therapy)- Chest surgery. Implants for trans women, mastectomy or other chest flattening procedures for trans men. Nonbinary people may also get chest surgery of any type.- Facial surgery. Some trans women get feminizing facial surgery, some trans men get masculinizing facial surgery (although this is more rare since testosterone often masculinizes the face enough to satisfy the individual). Some trans men get a hair transplant to form a beard, if they are not satisfied with the beard they get from testosterone or if they don\'t go on testosterone at all but want a beard.- Vocal chord surgery. Very rare but some trans women ""shave"" their vocal cords to make them thinner, thus giving them a higher pitched voice. Like all surgeries it comes with many risks and complications, one of the risks being practical loss of the voice.- Genital surgery. This is what people often talk about when they say ""the surgery"" about trans surgeries. We are often asked if we have had ""the surgery"" yet. In reality, ""the surgery"" doesn\'t exist. There are many different types of surgeries a trans person can opt for (as you may know now by this list), and even within the area of genital surgery there are many different options for either gender!- Other surgeries. Like all people, trans people can have insecurities with their body. Some trans women undergo surgeries to get broader hips/a bigger butt, some trans men liposuction their hips or butt, and there are many other procedures a trans person can undergo to alleviate dysphoria that most people wouldn\'t even think of!\nSometimes the transition forms a person chooses are because of dysphoria, sometimes we may undergo procedures just to obtain a more functional life. For example a trans man who isn\'t all that bothered by his chest may still choose to get surgery in order to be able to swim and bathe in public with his friends like any other guy. Sure, it would be great to live in a society where he wouldn\'t need to do that, but society isn\'t there yet and he should neither have to wait nor suffer until it is!\nWith all of this out of the way, I\'ll adress your specific questions.\n\n\nynes160515:\nTransitioning may leave trans woman sterile (even without the bottom surgery).\nThis depends. I will assume here that in this scenario, you\'re talking about a trans woman who is on estrogen.\nHormones only: The reproductive organs usually don\'t produce functional reproductive materia anymore during hormone therapy. It does vary a lot, however, and even on hormones it is still recommended to use protection if one wishes to avoid pregnancy (in case the trans woman is sexually active with someone who has ovaries. Of course whether protection is needed or not also depends on the type of sexual activity they engage in).\nShe is not permanently sterile though! If she quits her hormone therapy, most of the time she can produce reproductive materia again.\nIf she has had bottom surgery: A competent doctor will always recommend and give the option for a trans person to extract and save some reproductive materia before any hormonal or genital transition is initiated, so even if she became sterile due to either of them she could still have a biological baby.\n\n\nynes160515:\nTrans woman have less testosterone then cis woman, and therefore have less muscle mass, and are weaker then cis woman.\n??? This is one I have never heard of. Where did you hear this?I can actually neither confirm nor reject this one, but I will say I know several trans women and have never heard of this issue so if there is a difference it\'s probably not that big. I would love it if someone who knows the answer to this could educate me.\n\n\nynes160515:\nHormones will make facial and chest hair disappear, but will no affect ""private"" and armpit hair.\nA trans woman who goes on estrogen will not get more facial hair and chest hair than they already have, and in many cases it will lessen a little. In practice this means it all depends on when she starts on estrogen.If she starts on estrogen before puberty she will most likely not get any chest hair or facial hair at all.If she starts on estrogen after/late during puberty she may already have gotten facial hair and body hair. If she has, it will lessen but usually not disappear. Luckily, laser hair removal can still help her if she wishes to get rid of it!\nArmpit hair is pretty much the same for either gender tbh.\n\n\nynes160515:\nEven though hormones will give them boobs and redistribute fat (giving them a more feminine silhouette), they still need to get boob surgery (because their breasts look more like man boobs then actual boobs) and a surgery to get larger hips.\nThis depends a lot on the individual... There are trans women out there who pretty much had boobs already before hormone replacement therapy, just like there are trans men who never have chest surgery and are still perceived as flat chested. You would be surprised to know how different bodies can be!\nA trans woman\'s boobs will not automatically look more like man boobs as far as I know. The shape of someone\'s breasts will differ a lot from one person to another, this is true for cis women and trans women alike.\nHow her breasts change on estrogen depends on genetics. Trans women are often told to expect to get 1-2 cup sizes smaller than their cis female family members. This expectation may have changed in recent years with new data being available, but last time I checked this was still something doctors told transgender patients... I would imagine the shape of her breasts depends on those same genetics.Genetics play into pretty much everything here. Her hips and her other changes depend on genetics. Same goes for transmen. It is a common misunderstanding that trans men will not get all that deep voices, but in reality they get pretty much the same depth as their cis male family members.\nThere are of course exceptions!\n\n\nynes160515:\nTrans woman may end up developing breast cancer during their transition.\nBreast cancer being a risk of hormone therapy is a fear that has been prevalent in the medical community surrounding trans people for many years. Most licensed doctors don\'t consider this factual anymore though. There is no reliable data that proves the risk of breast cancer to be higher in transgender people who go on hormones than in the general population.\n\n\nynes160515:\nWould the hormones affect her dick\'s growth and development? (I know she\'ll most likely be sterile and she\'ll still have ""private"" hair, but like, will it stay prepubescent forever or be unable to become stiff?)\nFirst off, please do not refer to her genitalia as a ""dick"". Some trans women do that, but most do not. As a cis person writing a trans character, the wisest approach for you to take would be to call it ""genitals"" or any female coded genital word.If a trans woman chooses to use words that have traditionally been considered male coded to describe her genitalia, she has every right to do that. But only she has that right, and she only has the right to decide that for her own body - she does not have the right to decide what to call other trans women\'s genitalia.\nI understand you probably just used ""dick"" here for lack of a better word and to be specific, but I figured I would point this out to you since you are making an effort to do respectful writing and it would be good for you to know!\nWith that out of the way, a trans woman who goes on hormones after puberty often sees some shrinkage in the genital region.A trans woman who goes on hormones before puberty will not see any growth in the genital region to begin with. The potential downside to this is that if she wishes to have genital surgery, her genitals will not be able to create a very deep vagina. For some trans women this does not matter, and there are also other ways to form a deep vagina if it does matter to her. In practice, the pros of early hormonal transition often outweigh the cons for most trans women.\n\n\nynes160515:\nWill her boobs development just like cis grill\'s? (she never really became a man, so... IDK, in my head it just seems like she wouldn\'t have man boobs).\nI have no specific data on this since early transitioned trans women are not so common yet, but in most cases an early transition will mean it is harder to differentiate the trans person from a cis person of the same gender in the same family. So it is pretty likely that her chest size will be similar to that of her cis female family members. Once again, the shape already depended on genetics so that won\'t differ much. If her cis female family members have round, perky, droopy, pointy, whatever breasts then she will most likely have whatever they have.\nAlso an adult trans woman never ""became a man"" either. She was a woman all along, she just didn\'t experience circumstances where she could live as her true self until adulthood, or maybe didn\'t even get the chance to realize until adulthood.\nThere are of course exceptions, a few people have a type of gender fluidity where they feel fully like a certain gender for many years of their lives, then later may feel a different way. But this is not the case for most trans people, so unless they tell you otherwise, don\'t say a trans person ""used to be a man"" or ""used to be a woman"".\nHopefully this helps. You may want to listen to the perspectives of some trans people, I would recommend checking out Kat Blaque and Stef Sanjati. Aside from Stef\'s transition logs there aren\'t many videos specifically adressing their transitions, but there is something much more important there: Their experiences in life as trans women! Listening to and learning this can help you better understand trans people (trans women in particular), and thus make it easier for you to respectfully write your trans character\n If you explore further than these two trans youtubers, bear in mind that there are trans youtubers out there that don\'t promote understanding but rather sacrifice their own community for ad revenue, attention and acceptance from transphobes. One example of this is Blaire White. Avoid her videos like they\'re the plague.', 'Thank you so much!\nAlso, the testosterone thing was something I found initially on Tumblr under a post of Samus saying the secret for her strength was estrogen, the op explained that testosterone was linked to muscle mass, and because of testosterone blockers, trans woman have less testosterone then cis woman, which means less muscle. But I also found a phrase referring to that on one of the sites I stumbled into while researching.\nAlso sorry if the ""never became a man"" was offensive, I meant it like ""she never went through a male puberty"", I know that a trans woman is still a woman even before finding out they\'re trans.\nOnce again, thank you for all your help.']",1/24/2020 10:56

Maybe what I have in mind for my comics isn’t okay for tapas..? I’m not really sure. I’m sorry if what I’m trying to say isn’t really clear either lol
What I have in mind is one story I’m a little concerned with, but not really and I already posted the script over here12 for that one. It’s the other 2 I’m more concerned about.
One story is supposed to be happening at around the same time as the first one but it’s being told from the perspective of two minor characters in the first story and the other one is about the rise and fall of a famous jazz pianist and has little to do with the other stories.
My concern comes from the plot I have planned for the second story and the relationship between the jazz pianist and another character, a famous comedian. I’m worried that the plot is “too much” I guess? And I’m wondering if their relationship is too “showy”..? Not sure how to describe it without going into a bunch of detail here..","['To better explain: What concerns me about the second story’s plot is the fact that the whole story involves mobsters...

145,*FIXED* Tapas word counter error?,Answered,[],"EDIT: Issue resolved! The Tapas staff emailed me back, and @spicy_sweets was correct. I just had to go back and ""update"" my early chapters that were uploaded before the word counter was installed.The novel's word count is now rightly up to 32.9k.  
Leaving original post up in case anyone else has same problem:

Hello all, 
So I reached 50,000 words in my novel2 today (I haven't posted it all to Tapas quite yet because of scheduling) but I'm a little bit nervous that the site might not actually be counting the words accurately. I was wondering if anyone else was having this problem.
According to Microsoft Word, which is where I'm typing the draft, what I've uploaded (up through Chapter 9), is about 29,000 words. My dashboard says that the sum of the chapters is ""20.9k"" which is almost 9,000 words short. Since I've really been looking forward to finally having some Ink with which to support my favorite creators, it's made me a little nervous.
I've already emailed Tapas about this, but so far, I haven't heard a response, and since we're closing in on the deadline, it has me kinda worried. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Would there be a particular reason for the discrepancy? Things like hyphenated words, italicizing, etc.? Am I overthinking this?
Hope this is the right place to ask! ","[""Different algorithms do produce different wotd counts. When shooting for a specific minimum word count, I like to have a buffer of at least 200 words. A 9000 word deviation within 29,000 doesn't seem to me like a difference of opinion between one piece of software and another. Hyphenation doesn't explain a 20% difference. This does seem like a software error.\nYou did the right thing by contacting the staff. This being a holiday weekend (the Tapas office is located in California), I am not surprised that no one has gotten back to you yet. I wouldn't even look for a response until Monday. You still have a few days left in November to resolve any problems.\nIs there any chance that you simply misread your word count in one program or another?\nYou can confirm your word count on the NaNoWriMo site or here: http://www.wordcounttool.com1"", ""If you posted your work before the word counter was implemented, those chapters won't be counted until you open them and save."", ""@spicy_sweets Oh, good to know!

There two kids a little brother and his big sister. They go into the woods and find a rock and somehow fix it which summons a massive superpowerful genie like creature.
The little brother ask for lazer vision the ability to fly and explode.
the big sister ask for the ability to create anything, then destroy the rock that is anchoring the superpowerful genie to earth, severing it link to earth.
After this there a timeskiip and in the flashback covering the timeskip the little girl basically brought about the apocalpse creating magic, monsters and an rpg system for people to level up, then took over the world and has been ruling it ever since.
back in the post-apocalyptic future a robot girl is trying to fix a food making machine but she doesn't have the necessary part or something and apparently this is happening all over the world.the only one who can fix these machines is the big sister who is somehow still a little girl and called god by her subject(the world) however her servants keep blocking the robot girl from telling her about the food crisis.
so the robot girl goes on a journey to find the big sisters little brother and finds him a pocket dimension inside a time loop and he is now a teenager despite his older sister being a little girl still.
after free the little brother they join up with the rebel in an airship shortly after an epic battle in the sky between the rebels and the forces of the big sister takes place.

Zeus was into mortal women and a major cheater, Achilles had his legendary tendon, Midas was greedy and so on - a character's dramatic and narrative potential is ultimately decided by their faults, not their strengths. Not giving them a weakness might make readers feel indifferent towards your character. Again, if this is purposeful, then great. If not... well, not every weakness needs to be major.

Eg. for me, things generally considered positive like being very confident, or being bubbly, are flaws and will almost always make me suspicious.

163,Requesting honest critique for my comic,Answered,[],"I think now is a good moment to ask for some serious feedback for my comic - it's not a very long read yet. I don't know if anyone will want to do it, as I have nothing to give in return. But, big thanks in advance for taking your time and effort! 
Some background info... TFD is my first comic project. I know everyone says to not jump into making a super-long series with no prior experience, but on the other hand, I also saw advice like ""just start it, don't overthink it, or you'll never do it"". I had enough of myself procrastinating and wanted to start it at last. Now I wonder if it was a mistake.
I have two motivations for making this thread. First one is... Well, I wasn't expecting instant popularity, but I still find the amount of attention my comic gets rather disappointing.I know the longer your series is, the harder it is to attract new readers - which makes me kinda worried for this project's future. I'm determined to finish it, but it's going to be quite a long story (I already wrote the script, more or less - it still needs a lot of editing, but I can't make huge changes at this point). If I have no hope of having this comic recognized during the years I'll spend on it, what I'm even doing this for? If I was making it just for myself, I wouldn't have posted it online...
I'm not sure what's not working here. Does my series go unseen because I don't promote it enough, or is it ignored because of its low quality? I don't have any real social media following, so trying to promote on tumblr and twitter doesn't really do anything, but I suppose it's also that my comic just isn't particularly good. But, I need to know what specifically is wrong with it and how to fix it?
This brings me to the second motivation - I need critique on my art. I don't really have any opportunities to get feedback, so I'm left to figure out my mistakes on my own, and I think it's dragging me down. My art has been going through this cycle of ""artblock-mild improvement-artblock and skill decline again"" for a longer while now. I'm not really sure how to move forward anymore.
tl;dr I want to improve my comic and hopefully make it more appealing. No headpats please, I want honest critique here. I'm mentally prepared. :'D Critique my art, paneling, anything else you notice; nitpicking is fine, too. Even if you think it's just your own opinion, feel free to share it, maybe I could find it helpful.
https://tapas.io/series/TheFragmentedDream43","['So I just checked out your comic, and I’d say you don’t promote it enough. In all honesty, its quite good. But to nitpick, maybe the pacing is a bit slow. Also, keeping your readers confused/in the dark or not giving the story a clear sense of direction for too long might lead to readers losing interest. Can’t give much advice on art. Just try to get your comic out there so that people will know it exists in the first place.', ""I agree with @Deadpan_Tran that upping your promotion game would probably go a long ways. Even if you don't have large social media followings yet, I'd start working on building those :> Slowly but surely they'll grow. My art accounts are only about a year old so I don't have a large following by any means (~130 on Insta, 50 on Twitter, 30 on facebook) but I still notice a significant difference in views when I promote my releases vs. the few days I've missed promotion (I've missed promotions twice, and each time I had like half the release day traffic than I normally have. RIP)\nI'll try to return later after work and give it a proper read and see if I notice anything else though~"", ""Thanks for replies so far!\n@Deadpan_Tran you might be right with the slow pacing? There's still a bit left before chapter 1 ends, but I definitely need to speed things up in future chapters, just trying to figure out how to \nAs for self-promotion, well it's hard to promote yourself when everything you do is just screaming into the cold unhearing void. And it's not like I started posting yesterday, either. I extremely rarely get +10 notes on any art I post on tumblr. The most I ever got was ~80, and it was (obviously) fanart.\nI know many people get a lot of traffic on instagram but I'm unable to post there (yeah there are ways to get around it, but they sound not worth the trouble). Facebook is, uh, just no. And in general, I don't think I'm good OR lucky enough to get popular just by posting fanart or putting a tons of hashtags on everything...\nThough I suppose promoting yourself as an artist is a whole different problem, soo I guess let's put that aside for now."", ""I have a little feedback for you, I hope it's  helpful. \nIn lot of ways your comic is already very strong. And I don't know if I'm an oddball, but I'm more likely to read a longer comic than a new/short one. I like a good comic binge so if I'm into a comic I'm happy when there's lots of material. I'm not going to nitpick, but here are a couple things that stand out to me.\nAs far as pacing, I enjoy the conversations and think they're fine. But when it comes to some action scenes it gets a lot more confusing. Pages 20-23 I was really confused about what happened and I think it would help if you showed it and talked more about what physically transpired. I think character conversations and interactions are a strong point, but character transitions/dramatic actions could use some work. \nI enjoy the sketchy and emotive style. The more you work at it and study real human anatomy to see how you want to stylize, the better it will get. A lot of the artistic improvement is a mileage thing- just keep going, but definitely do anatomy sketches and study effective interpretations from other artists to hone it just that much more. \nOne tangible thing I think you could do to improve right now, artistically, is to push the values. I really like the monochromatic pages, and you already incorporate some value distinctions. My encouragement would be to do it more. Get some highlighting and shadow details and each page and panel will seem so much more alive and interesting. I took the liberty of quickly adding a couple highlights and shadows to a panel to show what I mean.\n\nimage.png553x541 308 KB\n \nYou don't need to go crazy- this took like two minutes of my life- but I think it makes a huge difference! I'd look at other artists who work in monochrome or limited color palettes and see how they handle it, and apply whatever is useful to you in your own work. Good luck!"", ""@Kat: yes it helps, thanks!\nI do feel like action scenes are my weakness, but I didn't know how much it is showing   So those pages are more confusing than intended (it is weird stuff happening that will be explained later, but it's not intended to be incomprehensible...). Good to know.\nValues were something I sacrificed for time-saving's sake. I agree it makes a difference, and I wish I could do more with them - but figuring out where the shadows should be is still not that easy for me, and I don't have a tablet (yet - hopefully... sigh), so more detailed coloring takes a while (above example would take me... more than 2 minutes to do for sure, lol). But I'll see what I can do."", ""Fair enough, and it always takes time- lots of it- to learn something new, but you'll get faster at it as you get used to it. I really think a lot of it is just mileage. Just keep going, you'll figure out what works for you. And ultimately it's a question of how much time and resources you're willing to put in. I think it's not a bad thing to just pump out pages or to slow down to make them as good as possible. It just depends on what your goals are, but either way I think you'll learn valuable skills, improvement, and efficiency over time. Definitely look into getting a tablet, that will speed things up a lot! You can get pretty cheap ones that aren't fancy but get the job done. You might even look into finding a collaborator who will apply values for you. There lots of possibilities and I think you're doing better than you think you are. "", ""Sorry to bump this  But I would still like to get some more feedback, so... anyone? Again, you can be blunt with me, I don't mind; in fact I'll be grateful."", ""I think it pretty great so far. Although the anatomy isn't all that great and there are scenes that are too dark. You could use stock references like senshi stock, Line of Action1, or yourself for practice.

Thanks in advance ^^\n  \n\n"", 'Thank you, this will help a lot', 'Try not to be too nervous, but I totally feel that! I\'ve only started uploading since October myself and taking that first leap is intimidating!\nI\'ll feed a few recommendations that can maybe help getting started easier tho:\nRegarding your art...\nIt\'ll never be good enough, so feel free to start way before that! Seriously- part of being an artist is that your drawing\'s always getting better as you draw more, and we\'re also often our own worst critic. As long as it\'s ""good enough"" you should just get started, it\'ll continue to improve over time! This includes consistency too... I have consistency issues still but it\'s not something my readers have complained about yet and I\'m working on it haha\nRegarding planning...\nThis kinda depends. How long of a story are you planning? If it\'s long definitely make sure you at least have the basic plot points mapped out from beginning to end. Starting a long story with little structure can lead to a general lack of focus and potential plot holes/issues. Not to say you have to have every detail planned out first (in fact don\'t do this xD) but it\'s useful to know what points A, B, C, & D are so you can at least continue steering the story in the right direction as you go. Maybe you hit sub plot A.5 but after that\'s done continue on towards B!\nBUUUUUUUT\nI would personally recommend you start with one or more short stories before hopping into a long one myself. Maybe some that are like between 10-50 pages long each. There are a number of associated advantages to this:\nWhen a project\'s short, you can feasibly complete it. \nWriting some complete stories front to back is important to learn how to end stories properly (which may never happen with a long project). Also it just feels good to finish things xD\nYou can use short projects to learn how to make comics better. \nThis ties back into ""your art gets better over time"": when you\'re first starting out you\'ll probably not know yet how to effectively use panels, lay dialogue, get a feel for how much or how little dialogue to include, etc. You can also feel free to be really experimental in a short story w/o feeling like you\'re tied down for 20 chapters with that experiment xD\nYou can get your ""test pages"" out of the way and start the next story off stronger\nAfter you complete a number of pages and get into the flow, your pages will be much better. It\'s useful to have these ""test pages"" in short projects so that you don\'t look back on the early pages of your long series and be like ""crap I had no idea what i was doing and now that\'s the first impression everyone who reads my story gets"". Granted that\'ll still happen since you\'ll keep getting better... but each new story will start off stronger than the last. First impressions count, and all that.\nI guess the tl;dr of that is consider starting with a short story to get a feel for comic-ing, even if it\'s just like a ""pilot episode"" for a bigger story you want to tell. Making comics is already scary enough, so don\'t feel the need to necessarily rush into a giant epic project right away ^^ If you do go this route, I would advise you quickly write something up and just hop right on in.

Something I made also to remind myself.', ""Lof of good advices here.Also: always remember that you HAVE the RIGHT to drop/delete/redo any project your working on. You don't owe anyone and if you start something and is not pleased with it, you can re-start or change projects as many time as you want. You have nothing to lose from starting your webcomic. "", ""Getting followers in general is an extremely difficult task and like it or not no one will really see your comic at first. You should use that time to just go crazy with what you want to do because no one (and you included) will see your art as enough. When it comes to planning, just choose something consistent and stick with it, like a page every Saturday or something. Just make sure you get your plan in order by the time you start updating, because if you don't you'll end up like me and not update for 3 1/2 months."", 'Do you have a comic ready? Or is everything still just in your head', 'Let me just say first, your art will never be good enough in your own eyes. You are your worst critic, and that\'s just how it is for all creatives. So get into the mindset that you will always need improving, and move on. Those thoughts will only hinder you from creating anything. Someone, somewhere, will love your story and art. You have to love your work too or else it will show through that you don\'t. Improvement is inevitable. You won\'t be perfect right away, or if ever! But you will get better and better the further you go.\nAssuming you haven\'t really drawn anything but you have the story idea, here\'s what my process is right before I start creating the darn thing.When I\'m starting a new story, there are a few key things I have to have done before I ever start drawing the comic, and especially before I post anything online:1.) Have the 3 ""acts"" or arcs of the story planned out. Know the beginning, middle, and end. Any important ""scenes"" in between will fit in somewhere and then fill in the gaps later. But for now, make sure you know how the story will start and end so that you aren\'t making it up as you go. Changes can be made later, but the goal is to START, so make sure you have a solid start. The hardest part is starting.\n2.) Characters. Have your characters actually drawn out first, like a character sheet, just so you have the image of them in your mind. Also make character bio\'s if you want. It\'s just fun.\nOnce I have a general idea of the story flow, and I know what characters will be showing up in the beginning, then it\'s on to the storyboarding phase of the first chapter or prologue!\nRough out your pages, or in Tapas or LW case, your long scroll formatted pages. Don\'t just start drawing willy nilly. Plan out the layout of the whole first chapter. Use reference of successful comics and study their layouts.I would probably do this for the first few episodes.Plan several chapters in advance. Since you\'ve already been planning so much, then perhaps create several chapters first before you post even one. If time isn\'t a concern for you, don\'t rush into it!  \nAnd that\'s how you start! It\'s really all up to you and when you feel ready. That could be now, later, or never. Just know that your first comic won\'t be your best, but if you don\'t take the leap you\'ll never make anything. If you have everything I suggested done already...what are you waiting for go go go!!! ']",12/12/2018 19:37

I've been observing their behavior and the discover section for years, I know what webtoon is about. Those section is really for them to make certain titles rise above others and boost them to top. The front banner has appear only their favorite so far with the exception of a few random ones. Yes, they may use some random comics to put randomly to cover up their favoritism but it's so obvious.

198,Some questions about premium,Answered,[],"I've been looking around Tapas and reading posts here and there but I can't seem to find the answers to the following questions. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

How long after you complete your premium series will you continue receiving payments? Say, for the sake of an example, you finished your series in a year but it remains on Tapas indefinitely. Will you keep collecting revenue indefinitely as well or will revenue stop at some point?
Can a premium series be paused or go on hold? Is there a wait period until it is removed from the premium section or does it stay up there until you continue? 
Is there a minimum number of views and subscribers to maintain after the series has began? What happens if you dip below it?
Tapas premium vs Patreon, which is a better option?  (provided you can get into Premium in the first place)

Thanks in advance.","[""You would have to ask a premium creator or @STAFF that question, but I think I can answer #4.  As far as Patreon goes, you can still have one if and when you get on premium, but I would recommend you get one because there's nothing wrong with having the extra money.  They work well together."", ""Thanks for the info. I appreciate your input. \nAlso, it's nice to know that incorporating Patreon can still work, I thought one would suffer over the other."", ""\n\nMichaelmyila:\nHow long after you complete your premium series will you continue receiving payments? Say, for the sake of an example, you finished your series in a year but it remains on Tapas indefinitely. Will you keep collecting revenue indefinitely as well or will revenue stop at some point?\nThis depends entirely on your individual agreement/contract, you will keep gaining revenue as long as the agreement runs (so basically as long as you and tapas are in an agreement that allows them to showcase and sell that comic. Soooo as long as it's on the app, to my understanding.) If you and tapas both wish to renew the agreement towards the end of its period, it will keep giving you revenue as long as the renewed agreement runs.Revenue depends on sales, so if you finish your comic long before the agreement runs out and then say a year after you finish it noone buys it anymore, then you will get no revenue anymore simply because there's no revenue that your series has gained.\n\n\nMichaelmyila:\nCan a premium series be paused or go on hold? Is there a wait period until it is removed from the premium section or does it stay up there until you continue?\nI have no input on this, only observations. Some comics do go on hiatus when a season runs out, preparing for the next season. I've also heard whispers from other creators and readers that at least one premium comic was taken off because the creator couldn't keep it going. Obviously if you long term find yourself unable to provide your end of the deal, that will be cause for the contract to be ceased for both parties' sake.\nThe update rate can be discussed with your tapas contact if you ever find that you aren't able to provide updates as fast as before. I have changed the update rate on mine a couple times; Once I upped it to twice a week, and then this year i lowered it back to once a week. I do believe the preferred rate is at least once a week though to keep your comic fresh in the readers' minds.\n\n\nMichaelmyila:\nIs there a minimum number of views and subscribers to maintain after the series has began? What happens if you dip below it?\nNot really. Obviously if your comic gets very popular that means it is more likely to attract more good deals along the lines. And more unlocks sold = more money for you. So there are things to be gained in better stats, but not really any punishments for bad stats.\n\n\nMichaelmyila:\nTapas premium vs Patreon, which is a better option?  (provided you can get into Premium in the first place)\nMy suggestion is to have both. If you are able, it's good to have some free content that is NOT tied to your premium comic (for obvious reasons, things that belong to your premium comic should remain within the bounds of the contract unless there are exceptions agreed upon between you and tapas) running on the side with extensions of that free content (early access, special illustrations) available on Patreon. This will give readers a chance to ease into your content before deciding to invest in you whether that be in your premium comic or your patreon."", ""You've definitely answered my questions, thank you so much.\nI agree with you about leaving some free content available. Since you've clarified that it can be discussed in the contract what can and cannot be included under premium it makes planning much easier (provided one qualifies of course).\nThank you for your time and input."", ""\n\nMichaelmyila:\nSince you've clarified that it can be discussed in the contract what can and cannot be included under premium it makes planning much easier (provided one qualifies of course).\nI should make clear that I don't know to which extent they are willing to stretch as I have not attempted anything of the sort."", ""I see, so then it's better not to assume anything until the talks begin.\nHowever, knowing what options are available to you can make a difference.""]",10/3/2018 4:30

Reckless Is He
What If the most powerful tool in the universe was a suit that allowed you to manipulate and travel through time?  What would happen if that very suit  just fell into the hands of your most unreliable friend?

**New episodes bi-weekly **





","['You misspelled Divine on that first text piece. That\'s already not leaving me with a good impression.  \nMmm as for the exposition, I personally don\'t like the tone of how the characters speak to each other in. It feels disrespectful and edgy of the character and it makes me not like him.\nThirdly, there are edgy words being thrown around in dialogue like ""The Reckless"" that I have no clue what that means as a casual, fresh reader who\'s just checking out the comic. \nI personally didn\'t actually read past the first 4 or 5 panels of the first episode because I don\'t have a lot of time to sit down and dedicate my brain cells to interpretation a clearly vast planned world with various conflicts. I am that internet reader who just wants a short comic snack. So I guess audience should also be taken into consideration.', 'Salutations!\nFirst thing\'s first, patience is key. More often than not you\'ll be in a situation where gaining subs is a slow crawl. This is okay, it happens like that most of the time and the best way to grow your audience is to interact with them across multiple platforms and make connections. Nothing happens overnight, so don\'t be discouraged if you don\'t see thousands of people clamoring for your work in a single month. Things just take time.\nNow, to get a better idea of the issue you\'re having I sat down and I read the work you have available. I\'ll start with the first thing: your title. Titles are THE way people find your work and your title is just a single word. Not to mention, if I go into google and search ""Reckless comic"" I get a spate of other works that aren\'t yours. I went through several pages just searching that title alone and I didn\'t see your work anywhere. Now, your title doesn\'t have to be something out there, and Reckless isn\'t a bad name by any means. However I wanted to give you the heads up that, you are hard to find with google search results. \nWhen I first started reading Gunnerkrigg Court, I remembered the name because it was so different, and often I spaced the author, Tom Sidell\'s name when searching. However, if you type in Gunnerkrigg Court in google you get Tom\'s comic right from the off. Now, this doesn\'t mean you have to change your title completely or something, maybe add a section to the title that sets your work apart from others with the same name. Example: Reckless - Suit of Time (or space or whatever you feel is best. Haha this is just an example don\'t take it too seriously XD ). Adding a little something to it, will make your work easier to find if you\'re coming from other platforms and can even set you apart on webtoons if there are others posted on that site that have similar titles.\nSo that\'s the bit with titles. Now onto the work itself: the first thing that hit me was confusion. Not with the plot, that was pretty straight forward. However, your panels are suffering from resolution issues. It\'s as if all of your drawings were made for a completely different platform and in order to get them onto webtoons you made them bigger or mushed them up to fit a size requirement. There are also panels that are squished into place such that the art is distorted and everything looks off. You also have the problem of losing details and, I\'ve noticed you\'ve drawn over some of the lines that didn\'t acclimate well to their change in size. In a visual medium when the story needs to be told in a visual way, this isn\'t something you want to have happen.\nTake panel two of episode two10 where Tyrone is in bed. You\'ve gone over some of the blurry lines and the sections where they\'ve been altered stands out from the rest of the piece and looks as though it doesn\'t belong. There\'s also the issue of the resolution making everything fuzzy in some shots, and then in other panels everything is fine. This lack of uniformity puts me off as a reader because I don\'t get access to consistent detail and important scenes really suffer because of it. I can\'t concentrate on a story when I\'m looking at something that\'s been blurred and had lines redone over the top of them, because I get distracted. You don\'t want your readers being distracted.\nThere are a couple ways to solve this issue. Resolution settings. I don\'t know which digital art platform you\'re making your work with but, I\'ll make an example of the one I work in primarily: Photoshop allows you to reduce the size of your drawing or to make it bigger without damaging the work. You just have to make a few choices when going into Image>size and choose whether you want Bicubic Sharper for reduction or Bicubic Smoother for enlargement. Also keeping ""constrain proportions"" on will make sure that you don\'t accidentally stretch the piece. This way, you can draw using a much larger canvas but still maintain all the beautiful details you\'ve put into the piece. Now, like I said this is for photoshop and if you work in a different program what you\'ll want to do is find out the breadth of their reduction and enlargement settings. If the one you have isn\'t adequate to the task you might look into other programs that can give you more the results you want in that regard. Another tip: knowing the website dimensions for the platform you\'ll be working on is key. If you work to those dimensions you\'ll be able to have the details you want and still satisfy the requirements of your host site so, I\'d look into those for webtoon and any other platform you want to use.\nFurther with the art, your characters don\'t seem to stay on model and are also inconsistent. Now, this is just something that happens to everyone, especially if you\'re getting used to the modus operandi you\'ll be using for your creative process. (It\'s different from doing single pictures because you have to work in sequence which presents challenges all its own, hahah) However, this is also off putting to a reader because the lack of consistency is distracting and can pull your readers out of the story. Now, you just put your comic out there and there are bound to be consistency issues, it\'s par for the course, so don\'t get too worried about it just yet. However, it\'s good to know it\'s there so that you can address it and work to keep everything on model. My best recommendation for this, is to draw out character dimensions2 as references (height, weight, etc. From different angles: front, back, side, and so on). This way, if you ever run into a modeling issue, you\'ve got shots of your characters from each angle and can use your own work as a reference. It\'s a very helpful tool (and one that lots of people make use of to help keep character\'s consistent over the course of a work). \nI would also include character close ups, face charts, etc. So that as you go along you have general consistency overall. Again, this is stuff everybody has to tackle in their own time and so there\'s nothing wrong with not being spot on right out of the gate. It\'s just one of those things and you\'ll get there in your own time, don\'t worry. You might also check out some tutorials on youtube to help you with modelling. Another thing you\'re going to want to think about with regards to your comic is consistent shading/lighting. When Tyrone was kidnapped and in a dark and dingy place, the lighting in the room didn\'t suggest that intensity at all, it was just about the same as the lighting outside. \nOne thing about lighting and shading, is that they can put an intensity into a scene that otherwise wouldn\'t exist, such that you sometimes don\'t even need words if you have the right shadows playing around in a scene. Experiment with lighting in each scene and see how the overall mood or feel changes. All that being said, your art is by no means horrible. You\'ve already got your style established and you have a strong skill-set at work here, it just needs some fine tuning and polish to really shine. I have no doubt you can make something incredible with your story as you go. Also, be mindful of your backgrounds. You have a problem with them being inconsistent and without shading as well and they\'re often blurry in sections (which, some of this might be due to the resolution issue) so, I\'d look out for that as you go.\nNow I know this has already been pointed out but, spell checking is also important so you don\'t derail your audience with spelling errors. Always run your text through a spell checker (especially if you\'re working late and your tired hahah) just in case. So, there are a few things that I think can help you out in the long term. You have an interesting story to start with and you do have some strong work. All you need to do now is just polish as you go. I hope the resources and examples I\'ve linked help you out and I wish you the best with your story. ', ""Ok I mean, they're not the best, but this reply was just reeking of condescension and rudeness. Secondly, what you like isn't universal. I found the banter funny, as did others. You could've just given an unbiased opinion, no?Look at how @SynCypher did it."", ""So for less salt and more review, some words are misspelled. Second, this is more art related, some frames are blurry and out of focus, especially on the old white man lol (forgot his name). Blurriness is good for background but not for main image. Third, your story feels a little bit rushed sometimes, especially with the roommate part. It kind of felt like a jarring transition. These are just small flaws, but you have an overall good comic. I recommend getting a beta reader since that helped me a lot after my 4th page. Also, stop LOSING CONFIDENCE! Building an audience takes a long time especially in a highly competitive site such as webtoons. Show yourself out more, make a social media page, etc. It'll pay off."", 'Hey! the style is very nice. English is not my first language but I think ""Reckless"" is pretty self-explanatory and attention-grabbing.   Others pointed out that just the word might not be distinctive enough when you search, maybe add a subtitle. I think there is a ""technical"" issue with your comic, the images look blurry. I can see the pixels, as if the images don\'t have good resolution. I thought that my laptop was not loading them properly, but  Some images look good some others pixelated. I think most users are willing to forgive flawed art, but the image resolution makes it discouraging and even difficult to watch. Also, the comic just started, some users wait until you have more pages to sub beause is too early for some to decide. Be patient and do your best  ', ""Hear hear on because this comic just started out, most folks probably aren't subbing yet because there isn't a lot of content to really sink their teeth into. I think it was like what? 2 Chapters or so until people really buy the story? Your first chapter being what hooks in the initial curiosity, and the following on to expand on what's been presented so far.\nAlso I think it's pretty normal for subs to peter off for a little bit before it picks up again. I see this in other comics I've done in the past as well as friends' work: you get a surge of followers, then it drops, then it picks up, so on and so on.\n@SynCypher wrote a pretty comprehensive review of areas that may need the most improvement. In my opinion, I think the messy, blurry visuals is what turned me off the first few pages. The sharp lines that are drawn over the blurry portions comes off to me, as a first-time reader, that you don't care enough about the quality in the first place. I'm sure that's really not the case! Because comics are such a visual medium, readers might not consider your efforts and just move on to the next title.\nAnother thing you might consider is that your summary doesn't do your story justice. When I read your summary, I expected something lighthearted, but it started off very dramatic and tense! D: \nSummaries are best written when there's a mystery for the reader to follow along on, or it ends on a question: Does the 'expert slacker' stumble upon a bigger conspiracy only his new-found suit can stop?\nI mirrored my comic on Webtoons and I notice it's a LOT harder to get newer subs there; Tapas and Smackjeeves and even TUMBLR has had more steady growth compared to Webtoons. But like many others have said, it's a waiting game and putting out the best work that you can!\nAll the best to you friend!"", 'Not gonna say anything on your lack of followers because you\'re one month old and calm down, please, they will come.\nI will say this. I HATE the font you chose for your speech bubbles. I think it makes it look really amateurish and cheap, and a little childish. I don\'t think it goes well with the tone of the story you are trying to tell. Also, a lot of the speech bubbles are REALLY crammed, your text should never touch the edges of the bubbles, so make sure you leave a nice margin all around.\nMoving on to art. I will say this, seeing the cover and then seeing what is inside was a huge shift, I think that\'s also a big factor why people don\'t stick around. When the cover looks better than what\'s inside the comic that\'s a huge let down, like, personally I saw that cover and I was excited to read but then seeing the panels I was very quickly put off by it. False advertisement is not cool. I also have a feeling that you might be making this comic as a regular comic and then translated to a scrolling comic? The pacing is really not great. The first panels have all this black space between them and everything is framed really tight, it doesn\'t feel inviting and more like I have to force myself to stay in this story. When we finish that prologue and jump to what I am assuming is the present (???) I get hit with this really zoomed in phone screen and it was very jarring and a complete change of tone, like break neck speed, which is sometimes good when used correctly but it really misses the point here. I think that phone text scene could work better if you have Tyrone in front of an indistinct background and have the text bubbles fly out of the phone. Also, When Tyrone is texting he should be texting in a professional way if he really wants to sound convincing to the audience, the moment he wrote ""... my work. My responsibilities..."" informed me he was full of shit and I immediately disliked him. Fool your audience longer, keep them in that realm of ""trust this guy"" after all he is your main character and you don\'t want the readers to immediately dislike him.\nI get you are trying to write these sassy, witty characters but it\'s just... not happening. Most of the time they come off as assholes and condensing, they\'re not fun like Deadpool or Spiderman levels of sass, they just don\'t even sound like real people. You don\'t want to create these strawmen characters no one can relate to because no one really talks like that... or acts like that. Who is he talking to when he gets off the phone? Is he talking to us? Why? The whole point of a character breaking the 4th wall is that they have been established as being completely aware of everything, aware of the pages in the comic, the confines of the panels, the person writing and illustrating them, far as we know Tyrone is just some guy, why is he breaking the 4th wall? Is it for exposition? Whatever it is, I feel like a main character shouldn\'t break the 4th wall (unless they are completely chaotic from the start).\nI checked out your Instagram and you have some pretty nice art! Your style is pretty cool and I just don\'t see it translated in this comic. Maybe you are rushing things? But really take your time to put quality work out there because like some people have already mentioned, readers don\'t like mediocre work and that\'s a huge reason why a lot of people don\'t stick around. Be mindful of the resolution of your panels and the consistency of the characters, they are all over the place. If you are making a scrolling comic, make a scrolling comic from the start! A side-to-side comic doesn\'t translate well into scrolling, just choose a format and go with it. Stay consistent and keep learning, don\'t take our critiques too harshly and use them to improve. I have been where you are (hence why I\'m rebooting my comic) so don\'t lose confidence! Keep working!', '@J.Z.Castillo So I\'ve been getting a lot of great feedback on here, I asked for it, and I appreciate it. However, I\'m responding directly to this one because you made a few comparisons that I don\'t agree with. On to ""no one really talks like that, or acts like that"", I\'ll argue that no one you know talks like that. A lot of this banter is taken from my shitty friends. I\'m not trying to make these characters sound familiar to you. Also, You aren\'t supposed to ""like"" Tryone. I\'m not trying to make him sound like Spider- Man or Deadpool. This isn\'t a superhero story. I want people to ask ""why him? He is breaking the 4th wall because it his a tribute to Ferris Bueller, which is how Tye sees himself. The episode is even titled ""Bueller"".  I won\'t defend anything else because I see your other criticisms as fair, I welcome that kind of advice. Thanks for taking the time to check my Instagram art. I\'m working to bring the same level of quality to the story.']",9/21/2018 14:52
201,Length of Updates,Answered,[],"Hey, if you are entering the webtoon contest, you probably know that there is a minimum panel limit per episode for your entry to be eligible. In my case I have to make sure that the first 4 episodes have at least 35 panels. I update weekly. While i usually might not be able to make 35 panels per update, i am trying my best to do this to make sure i'm eligible. 
My question is though. After the contest round ends, I will probably have to change my length of episodes. 
As a reader or comic creator what do you consider too short an update? 
I want to try my best to be consistent but I also want to make each update worthwhile reading.","[""as a new creator i try to keep a 20 panel per update minimum.as a reader, panel count doesn't really matter as long as the update properly presents a meaningful action/conversation/idea across.(actually the only times i count the panels is just to gauge what an acceptable panel count per update would be for at least the Webtoons audience)\nKeep in mind your readers will always ask for more no matter what you do so don't worry too much about it lol."", 'I have been thinking the same thing! I have already uploaded my minimum of 4 episodes with 35 panels so now I have let myself relax a bit and not be as concerned with the Episode length.\nI don\'t think there is any easy answer to this question though. I think the most important thing to consider is the story. Readers would much rather have 10 well thought out panels that further the story then 20 ""fluff panels"" that really don\'t add anything new...', ""I think in terms of print media, where a story-driven page consists of roughly 5-7 panels. If you're doing one weekly update, 15-21 panels, or 3 pages, seems perfectly reasonable. In the end, it really comes down to staying consistent, so go with what your schedule allows.\nI personally prefer smaller, more frequent episodes thanks to the annoying scrolling nature of current webcomics. I simply lose interest if an episode is more than 10 panels."", ""Funny, I tend to not think a story is worth my time if it doesn't have the content to fill more than ten."", ""Well that's your personal problem I guess. No 4-koma for you. I'm gonna make every scene I write 1000 panels long because that means there's more content right?

If panels are not necessary, get rid of them."", ""Hmm I'm gonna just do 15-20 panels per update and see how that goes. Got multiple comics I'm working on, so that's the best I can do, even with a buffer. \nPersonally, I'm not a fan of short updates. 19 Days is basically the only comic I read where that is the case, and it's probably only tolerable for me because its comedy/romance. However, I'm not a frequent reader on Discover but from what I've seen shorter updates aren't much of a problem as long as they're sufficiently frequent and regular.""]",9/2/2018 13:21

Also does anybody knows if the Webtoons that are promoted at the bottom of the homepage if they're handpicked by staff or automatically selected by the system after specific requirements have been met?","['I want to know the mystery too~!', ""Depends the section you're talking about, but here's what I noticed.\nHot Today - Switched around every 24 hours, but some series get kept on up to 2-3 days.

i would be grateful feedback and first thoughts about the comic i have not long started posting. as i am not sure at this point if to just start over. the comic is aimed at mature readers and first made for a spanking art site (but the comic has much more than just spanking in it) At present i don't know if to keep posting what i had done before and phase out the unpopular stuff or start over and cut it all together? personally i think society has become far too censored but if i want followers and subs i have to keep my personal opinions about that to myself and just do what fans want i guess?

221,Trouble picking which story of mine to make first,Answered,[],"Hello! I've recently been trying to follow my goals of creating stories, starting with making comics since it's truly a medium I love with all my heart, but also something I'm really unsure how to start.
I've heard a lot that you aren't meant to start with your important projects, to instead start with one that's not as dear to you, so you can give yourself room for mistakes and growth. I agree with this completely so that's what I was scripting, but after a few months I realized that even though I adore the characters I have on this practice project, the story part just wasn't working. My goal is to create something that I personally want to read but I just can't put much emotion and complexity on the current plot.
Now I feel a little trapped. I have a lot of other stories I can tell, but they're all so important to me that I can't decide which one to become prey to my beginner mistakes. I could try and keep developing the one I'm meant to be working on until something clicks, but what if it never does.
I would really love to hear other peoples' stories of how they chose their own first comic, or advice on my current situation.
Thanks so much for taking the time to read either way, have a good day! <3","[""Start with the story you believe you would be able to complete. That's where I started! \nOr, well. Tbh, I started with Heritage first, but I was never really happy with it. It was this huge elaborate idea where I wanted to make 5-6 different comics that would later be intertwined and... The more time passed, the less I felt like I would be able to continue working on it. \nBut we also need to start somewhere. I wouldn't worry about making mistakes at all, because we all do them and learn from them! Even tho I've been making comics for 10 years now, I still learn. \nStart with a story for about 5-10 pages, make it short. Make it about whatever you would love to read about, and go from there once you've got a story you're ok with. \nI know the feeling far too well tho, I have about 5-6 comics I want to make, but they're still in the making in my head. I still haven't figured out some of the important plot points and details to further the story, which is why I've been waiting with them. \nSo, start with a story you feel is more or less finished and take it from there, maybe? "", ""I agree with @Chopythes, start with what you think you can complete. If you get the point where you really wanna work on something else, then there's nothing wrong with dedicating a little time to something else. If nothing else, it may help you prevent getting burned out on your main project. \nI've been working pretty steadily on my main novel recently but I got an urge to do short stories too, so now I give myself scheduled breaks from my main novel to work on the short stories. It can be really refreshing actually. "", ""@Chopythes; It never feels like I can make a story that small, but I suppose it would be best to try for that ;; Though I do have side plots that are fairly short of much larger stories I have. Maybe cutting around the edges would be best even if that leaves a possible audience out of context? \nYour reply helped me feel a bit better, thank you! And much luck with your stories, that intertwining idea sounds really cool. I'll definitely check out the projects you have up now "", ""@Peni That's true too, gotta be mindful of mental/physical limitations instead of just creative ones. Thanks! Smart thinking, keep creating!  \nLet's be honest, I'm gonna look at everyone's projects on here, it'll be repetitive if I keep announcing it pfft"", ""Make a story about someone buying groceries or something mundane? Or take some inspiration from other people's short stories?  \nIt's only to make you get a feeling for how you wish to do your comic, but you're always allowed to experiment!<3"", 'While there\'s definitely value in practicing storytelling on something short before you jump into the deep end (the first comic I drew was a 100 page story that a friend wrote and paid me to illustrate), I think it\'s also valid to create a thing you really care about early on, as long as you\'re willing to surrender the idea of it being PERFECT and know that the story and art will grow along with you (Runewriters is the first comic I\'ve actually tried to write myself, and Lord willing it\'s gonna be like 700 pages).\nIt\'s really easy to feel like you have to save your most precious story for later, and not work on it until you\'ve really cultivated your skills. But I also look at ideas as having an expiration date -- that I will change as a person and if I don\'t tell this story for years and years, eventually my voice will be different and it won\'t fit that story that I created years ago anymore. That story was an expression of who I was at the time -- I can\'t tell it now without changing a lot. So it makes more sense to tell the stories I have to tell now, while I still can.\nMaybe in 10 years when the comic is finished I\'ll look back and go ""man, I could\'ve done a lot of this better,"" but by that point in time I\'ll have so many new ideas I want to create. It\'s okay to go ahead and get out the ideas you have now; you don\'t have to treat them as precious nonrenewable resources because like.... look, you\'ve already got 6 ideas. You\'ll make even more. Don\'t worry so much about saving ideas until you\'re a perfect storyteller because that\'ll never happen; just get some of these ideas out of your head!!\nI had a professor in college who made a goofy journal comic out of sharpies and hilighters, and it was a weird style he kind of got known for, but the webcomic he was working on starting some day was planned to be like, kinda realistic and beautiful and detailed. He had a lot of plans for that comic -- until a year after our class, when he got in a hiking accident and was killed. It struck me that everyone who drew tributes to him tried to mimic the hilighter-and-sharpies look of his journal comic -- the one thing he did get around to making.\nIn the end, the work you\'re known for isn\'t the beautiful idea you\'ve been perfecting, but the imperfect thing that you actually create.', ""I think it could be a good idea to start with a smaller story, but maybe you should also consider starting on one of your important projects and maybe going back later when you've developed as an artist to redraw some of the earlier episodes and maybe polish up the dialogue. When I've done that, it's been very rewarding to see the improvement between the first and second version of a page. Raining knives is a story that started out with art that wasn't always perfect, building a bit of a following in the process, and then was rebooted with a more developed art style, to the delight of its readers. It may or it may not be the best option, but I think it's definitely worth considering! "", ""I had a similar problem recently, I had to pick a new story to write for the writers camp. I had three stories in mind that were kicking around my brain, one of which was actually written in a script format to turn into a graphic novel. What I ended up doing was writing a few chapters of each and seeing which one came together the best and which one I thought I could finish more easily. It's a lot of work, especially from a comic perspective, but it helped me objectively compare which story was better."", ""This... This oml, this is one of the most important things I've ever read... I needed this so much, I've just been sitting here for an hour awestruck. Thank you so much!! Words can't describe how much this changed my thoughts. I'm definitely gonna think over this way more and start working properly! I need to write this in a notebook because this is something I can't afford to forget. Just... Thank you with all my heart  Your words have truly touched my soul."", '@Progg, @JackRasputen, Thanks to you two as well! All of your words mean a lot and I have a lot to think about. This thread is extremely important.', 'Hey, I\'m just gonna pop in here because i think you may have misunderstood something about the ""don\'t start with your magnum opus"" approach.the reson people, as far as i know, often say that isnt necessarily because of your artistic abilities! you might be fantatsic on the get-go and even more likely, you\'ll probably always be improving and dislike your old art. that\'s part of growing as an aritst!i think people tend to advise against starting with your most important project is that they\'re hard to complete. they\'re often these huge, 5000 pages projects with super complicated plots and world-builds. starting with that without a previous readship, and without experience with the workload, can be difficult, and of course- finishing you comic is such a huge part of the satisfaction of making it, singing up for a 10 year project off the bat can be hard.i think if you think you\'re ready to make that commitment- do it.and if you\'re not, but still want to work on your favourite projects, you can make little spin offs for them, teasers, or AUs, so you\'re experiencing them in a bit of a different way. either way, best of luck, man!', ""That's very true as well, though admittedly I would've failed that as well with my practice project because I was trying to make everything interesting, which would lead to a large amount of pages for side plots hhh. The school life was the only part I enjoyed, maybe cutting it into like 3 stories in the same world would've been more enjoyable to read and write as well. Woah you're giving me a lot of ways I could revive the series haha this wasn't anyone's aim. I'll have to sit on that for a bit. Thanks though!\nIt's not so my much my art skill itself, since I've basically accepted that even the most practiced artists doubt themselves from time to time, so as long as I continue to practice heaps, that'll be fine. It's more nervousness on comic layouts and fear of endings hhah. But recently discovering someone remade a comic ending 4 times completely before they were happy with it makes me feel a lot better-And you're very right, though I'm totally okay to have a day job for life, it's still a lot of work, especially for my bigger projects I'd need to do large research about minerals, fossils, cultures, history, before I can really finish writing o o ps at least learning is fun\nI've decided to do a really stupid side story of my character's past that no one will really understand the context but hey, a fun sorta challenge! And it'll be a handful of pages so fitting in all the advice. I can just totally delete it off the internet if I regret it later but would love to see if I could get criticism somewhere when it's done. :0\noof sorry for rambling, but thanks so much for the reply! A lot more good brain food definitely. Best wishes to you too!!"", ""I recommend starting with the shortest story you have that you can still feel very passionate about.Or, if you have trouble starting anything, then just start with the story that you WANT TO write. Just write it, ruin it. You can always REWRITE it from the scratch, anyway.\nIt should be remembered that there's a subset of writers(a certain Paolini comes to mind) who start with their magnum opus and, through years of writing, hone it to relative perfection. Just start writing.\nHOWEVER; this is all in relation to novel writing. Comics are a harder beast.... although I would still recommend doing something that you're passionate about. That way, even if you fail, you'll want to keep going because you love the story. In the end, it's the act of creating that keeps us doing what we do. The love of the craft."", '\n\nStaticReality:\n\'ve heard a lot that you aren\'t meant to start with your important projects, to instead start with one that\'s not as dear to you, so you can give yourself room for mistakes and growth.\nOne thing that stood out to me in the OP was this line ""not as dear to you"", and I just want to offer a small warning about that! It\'s not so much that the story should be less important to you than your ""big, amazing best story"", but just shorter and more complete-able. I\'m like 99% sure you already understood this but I just wanted to emphasize xD\nI\'ve just gotten back into making comics recently for the firs time since Highschool, which was like 6 years ago now. Starting in December I started working on remaking the big fantasy story that I\'ve had bouncing around in my head since middle school, but in January after completing page 8 forced myself to stop. I had been thinking about the early chapters (I had about the first 8 chapters fully planned, and a general sense of the middle (probably like 50 chapters) and the ending) and realized ""wow, the first fight scene wont be completed until like the end of 2018"" and that\'s when it hit me: That comic was waaaaaaay too long to start with LOL I still looooove the characters, setting, concepts, but there was no way I could commit to that right out the gate. \nSo I stopped and begun developing a shorter one-shot story in February. I took a group of side characters from my main story and developed them into the main cast, and set the story in a world similar to, but different, from my main project\'s. The finished story will be 66 pages long, hopefully complete at the end of the year  I\'ve just started coloring the 3rd page last night. After spending 2 and a half months going from base concept to finished storyboards I\'m really excited to be working on this project, though! It doesn\'t hold the same nostalgic weight as the story that\'s been bouncing around in my head for 10 years, but I\'ve managed to create something shorter that I\'m just as enthusiastic about!\nSo... I rambled a lot to get here, but just be sure to work on a project that\'s still dear to you, in short!', ""@shazzbaa I was gonna go foray into this forum parroting the main question, as I too have too many stories I wish to write, but honestly, you just gave the best answer. And I want to thank you for that! I'm petrified about not being able to get any of my ideas out there before something bad happens, be it career/health, so this is kind of a weird confirmation that I should really just get on the horse, y'know!

To pertain more to your question at hand: I wouldn\'t tag it as ""Military"".

270,Other Sites For Art? [ Answered: THANK YOU! ],Answered,[],"Okay I'm half scared to ask since I've never been on actual forums before but I really want to ask this question.
I've been on sites like: 
Tumblr, Deviantart, and even Twitter for art posting but I feel like the communities aren't as great.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the lay out or how the sites function.I've also seen very amazing work but I'm finding myself very limited.
I've been told Pinterest and Buzzfeed are other places to go to but I'm not so sure.I've also had concerns to post on facebook for how my friend has mentioned Facebook's copyrights being ableto override your and allowing them to use your work so I'm a bit subconscious to doing so.
I was only asking if anyone knew any other websites besides:* Deviantart (I'm not too fond of it for the things I've run into or people I've met)* Tumblr (A bit too pornographic based but I'll live.)* Pinterest (Not so bad)* Twitter* Facebook* Buzzfeed* FurAffinity (I just hate hearing my other friends bash on anthros/furries because they're inconsiderate and treat them like they aren't people...)* Instagram

In this ship, there's a monstrous amount of books from that time. Wati needs to read them for plot reasons (and she also is really interested in the ''ancient world''), but the problem is that I'm not sure if it's believable to have her language be somewhat similar to what it was 300 years ago. It's not exactly the same. There are words that changed, and the idioms/expressions are not that same. She would have some difficulties to read the books and understand the meaning of some things.
Is it realistic ?","['Consider it this way, can you read a story written in English from 300 years ago? Shakespeare\'s plays are over 300 years old but we are able to interpret and analyse those. I think the fact that your protagonist is interested in the ""ancient world"" makes their ability to read the text even more believable. \nIt\'s important for a main character to \'stand out\' in some way from the rest of the cast so maybe the way your protagonist stands out is that they have a \'codex\' of knowledge on this old civilisation which enables them to interpret the language.', ""I mean, formal written English really hasn't changed in the USA since the Constitution was written, which was 240 years ago.

You gave me an idea with the cellphone example.  Since many things from 300 years ago doesn't really exist anymore, Wati would know what some objets are !"", 'No unless it is a dead language. A good example is latin it will never change because anybody use it for daily activities but it is the root of many languages such as Spanish, Italian or French.', ""I don't think 300 years is that long so yeah it is realistic, languages like arabic, while arabic dialects have developed and changed, formal arabic had been kept the same for much much longer than that because there is an effort to keep it the same, like we learn it in schools and it's the language used for anything formal (speeches, the news, etc) and it is the language used in writing but not in speech. I'm not sure if you're going for your own language in your story but if it's not english then I suggest looking at languages from other cultures too, because there are a few that didn't change as much as english."", ""It depends on the language but I wouldn't say it'd be a big problem.

285,How long does it take for tapas to answer after a book submit?,Answered,[],"Hello! as the title says, I submited a story to tapas and am waiting for a response! No one knows how long does an answer usually take?","['Hate to say it, but technically you are not entitled to a response.  Tapas is an established publishing company, and like all established publishers, unsolicited manuscripts end up in the slush pile.  Yes, while its not polite to give no response, many publishers are inundated with hundreds to thousands of pitches and manuscripts and they simply lack the time and/or resources to respond to every one of them.  Many agents and publishers  state on their submissions page that if no response is received after X weeks, your submission should be regarded as a no.\nThe slush pile is reviewed when there is available time.  To the best of our knowledge, given that there is only one acquisition editor at Tapas, and if that editor\'s queue is full, there may a very long wait time.  Because that editor also receives vetted manuscripts from authors represented by agents, an agent represented manuscript will always get first consideration because it has likely been seriously critiqued already.  By nature agents will only represent strong work they think they can sell.  Consequently an acquisition editor under a load is going to go with manuscripts that have already been cherry picked, rather than sift through the haystack for a needle. \nTo give you some idea of the wait time, back when Tapas did their well promoted 30 Day Writing Challenge, all entries waited approximately 2.5 weeks for a response.  To the best of our knowledge ultimately there were no winners.  Entries instead received a semi-form rejection letter with two fonts, one font for standardized text, and another front for customized text.  (Keep in mind that generic rejection letters are considered standard for the industry.)  The rejections were short and to the point.  Please understand if you receive a rejection (which is the most likely response) you will not likely get any meaningful reason as to why or how to improve as it takes time/resources to compose a detailed response.  The most common rejection is ""your submission is not a good fit for us"" which again, is the most common response in the industry.\nHere are some good guidelines for a successful submission at Tapas that is not represented by an agent.\n1) Do you have an established, significant social media following that you can monitize for sales once your book is available on Tapas?2) Is your pitch/manuscript already formatted for or able to be broken up into ""bite sized"" portions of episodic reading, with each portion ending in a highly addictive manner that keeps a reader hooked and purchasing more?3) Is your story appealing to the young female and/or LGTB demographic? (Fantasy, romance, and LGTB books are the most purchased content on Tapas.)4) Is your story well written and ""turn key"" with minimal editing required to make it ready for market?\nWe certainly hope that you receive a positive response in a timely manner.  If not, hopefully the above information can give you some direction on what to consider when trying again with a submission to Tapas.\nSincerely,-Rejected', 'Hm, yeah @GoldenPlume is exactly right. In a creative industry unsolicited pitches more likely than not get no responses back. Keep at it though. It just takes that one yes to make it happen.\nGoing to mark this thread as answered but please feel free to continue discussing.', 'Thank you so much for your detailed answer! I was lucky to receive an answer yesterday - rejected too. But I know what to expect from a process like this now. I will try to improve my story following your  advices ', 'If you don\'t mind sharing, so we can help future authors with questions, was your rejection a short, ""not a good fit for Tapas"" or something else?']",5/2/2017 0:00

287,Organizing comic order,Answered,[],"Hi,
I drew about 30 episodes of my comic and uploaded them so that they would come out on Monday-Saturday.   Sunday would be a day off and then a new week long story arc would follow.  I'm up to episode 42 and episode 7 just came out. 
As I go along though something will come up so I draw it up and publish it,   I'm wondering if there's a way after the dates to organize it so the stand-a-lones don't interrupt the week long story arcs?

Accumulate a total and divide views or subs for one series by the total views or subs for all series combined. That way you can get a popularity percentage that indicates how much of the tips should go to that specific series.\nThis method, however, only works in theory. It doesn't account for that one really supportive fan that tosses you all the coins they have. I think 95% of my tips come from like 10 or so really passionate fans rather than a wide group of people. That one fan might only be interested in one of the series.So another alternative I guess is to either just split the tips equally, or go into a deeper study of audience engagement. For example, I could probably name 5 of the tippers that I can assume to be the most active as of right now, and I can name which of my series they really care for.

I'm making up a bit of a fantasy world with some made-up words and other imaginary things, and while in writing I know it's best to ""show, not tell"", I feel like trying to do that in a comic/through a visual medium can cause some confusion and awkwardness in the flow of scenes. 
For example, in the culture I am creating people have two names; a ""true"" name known only by family and loved ones, and a nickname which is generally used by everyone else. This isn't really something I can show through my drawings, and just directly applying it in dialogue by calling a character by two names can get confusing. Yet having a character verbally explain the entire concept to another character also seems a little strange and unnecessary (since all characters are supposed to be familiar with this naming system). 
The kind of note I'm thinking about I see used a lot in manga, usually to explain Japanese puns, and looks a bit like the text between panels on this9 page (sometimes put into a separate box or sideways). 
Is this generally acceptable, or would it be considered tedious and the best option is to try and convey everything through drawings and dialogue?","['It\'s not so bad, but it can get excessive and it puts some people right off by insulting their intelligence. It\'s much better to explain things through dialogue and imagery, allowing the reader to naturally figure things out gives them a greater connection with the world you\'re creating. It is a balancing act, as being too obtuse can just be alienating – the opposite effect. You can afford yourself a certain amount of exposition to explain things through dialogue - known as an ""idiot lecture"". Which is still clumsy, but less immersion breaking than explanatory boxes out of nowhere. My main issue with them is they instruct the reader to become familiar with - and care about - a world by reminding them that they\'re not a part of it. It\'s much better to immerse people – create something they want to explore and learn about.\nThere is a much better way to do it though: clue your reader in. Give them a scenario or a line of dialogue that centres the concept and then use small moments to create a firm idea.\nFor example, the two name thing is easy enough (though I don\'t know much about what you\'re setting is), why not just demonstrate it by two characters referring to a third by two different names  – and then having the non-close character say something along the lines of ""So THAT\'S her familiar name!?"" If you then follow up with characters in situations where they\'re named differently by different people, it should give the reader plenty of scope to figure it out.', 'i think sometimes its necessary, but as others have said you have to be careful not to get excessive as it gets a lil insulting. i once read a comic where some of the scenes were set in south london, with london slang, and everywhere there were asterisks. as an east londoner this was... really funny, and made the dialogue sound awkward, because it was spattered with these slightly-off-the-mark translations. in that case, it was something they could google, or get from context clues.\nin other cases, id say its the lesser of two evils. either you explain it in a footnote, or youre stuck doing an exposition panel / page that youre struggling to fit in comfortably. like, for some elements of the culture and words.', ""In this case I would definitely avoid it. Don't explain your plot through side notes. I would generally only use those for explaining, like, cultural things or language discrepancies, like in the translated mangas. I've seen the true name/nickname thing done before without side notes, so I'm sure you can find a way."", ""Bruv*, best allow** the side notes. Man's*** got no time for that.\n*Friend**Stop it***I/he - collective pronoun that's applied flexibly."", 'basically lmao\nrudeboy* buff** sideman***\n*referring to a stranger, derogatory** good looking*** sidekick / kissarse. ill allow em that one tho bc sideman means a TOTALLY different thing in america', 'I would avoid it, as it can be clunky. If you feel you have to explain some things then it may be that they aren\'t written clearly enough for the reader. At the same time, most readers are smart and can figure things out based on context cues.\nThe familiar name, nickname thing can be easily solved by just having characters with different relationships use the different names. Admittedly, I was worried about that in my own story, I have a character whose name is Dionisia, her husband calls her Diot, and her grandkids call her Grandee, but so far no readers have mentioned they are confused. They relationship of the characters is spelled out and people ""get"" that a grandkid wouldn\'t be calling their grandma by their full name like a colleague would.\nI think most people have experience with professional and personal names and nicknames. We all know at least one person who goes by different names, so it isn\'t a completely foreign concept at all. You can also have the character be offended that someone called them by the ""wrong"" name, and it could be an interesting character moment.', 'yueu:This isn\'t really something I can show through my drawings\n""Show, Don\'t Tell"" doesn\'t mean ""use pictures instead of words,"" just for the record. You can ""show"" using dialogue. ""Show, Don\'t Tell"" just means to let the reader see evidence of something and draw their own conclusions rather than telling them how to feel.It\'s not always applicable -- as a silly example, having a character say ""My name is Jack"" is a bit of exposition, but if you try to figure out how to ""show"" that instead of directly saying it, you\'re tying yourself in knots for something that\'s really not worth it.\nSo, for the true name vs. nickname thing, I don\'t think it\'d be a sin to have a note, as long as it\'s efficient and doesn\'t insult the reader -- like, a protagonist is introduced and a caption says ""his truename is Sparrowhawk, but since truenames are sacred, he\'s called Ged,"" then that\'s pretty efficient and lets the reader come to some conclusions on their own -- now, a character calls him ""Sparrowhawk"" and we immediately understand something about that interaction, and have to piece together on our own what kinds of people are allowed to know or use that name. It still allows you to ""show"" the significance of that practice.\nOn the other hand, if your footnote is also a short explanation of this practice and its cultural implications, I think you\'d be over-explaining, and explaining those things wouldn\'t have the same impact as watching interactions and piecing together exactly how the different names are used.\nAs DMBrigman and shiftingverses pointed out, it\'s usually possible to fit this sort of thing in the narrative -- if you just use the different names, I think folks would miss the significance of the Truename and assume it\'s just a nickname, but if there is space in the narrative for, say, a character to ask about another character\'s truename (""I can\'t tell you my truename, I just met you!"" is exposition, but isn\'t weird for characters who know about truenames to say to each other), that can make the whole thing feel more natural.In general, I think anything you can let the audience put together in that way feels a lot better, and makes your world feel real in a way that constant footnotes do not. Bringing together characters who feel different ways about established pieces of the world makes it much easier to talk about and also puts those pieces into context. But it\'s also sometimes not worth tying yourself in knots trying to avoid saying a single sentence directly -- so I think what\'s the best way to convey it is going to vary from example to example!\nIt\'s not so much about restraining yourself to ""the drawings and dialogue"" specifically, and more about looking for places for this cultural or world detail to be demonstrated through interactions and through the story itself!', ""I tried the text between panels for an older comic of mine, but I found it got really distracting really fast. So I deleted all of but one or two of them when I posted the comic online. It's like watching a movie with some random person giving commentary that you didn't ask for. Some people might like it, others...ehhhh..."", 'If you\'re really concerned about the specific name problem, something that may differentiate the nickname vs true name is having a figure of authority around. It\'s one thing for a bunch of friends to call someone by a nickname, but it\'s entirely another when an angry mom does that whole ""LOREM IPSUM!! GET YOUR BUTT IN HERE!"" Perhaps there\'s an elder in the culture that refers to them as their true name. If you give the person saying it obvious authority and formality in the culture (and I don\'t mean by being snobby or whatever, just that they\'re serious about their job) you can imply the formality of the true name they call your characters. \nAs for showing not telling? In my comic we get around the whole needless notes on world building by doing two things:  1. The most important. Give. Hella. Context. Clues. Use your page space to spell out the ideas as quickly and completely as possible. For example on this page and this page we talk about HIVES. They\'re kinda like security cameras that just kinda float around in the sky. We show the HIVE when we talk about it, have the character looking at, talking about \'needing eyes\' and \'tapping a hive\', again the same character is looking at these objects as the person they\'re talking to say\'s they can\'t \'tap in\' because \'they\'ve gone dark . It was easy our readers to understand that the characters are talking about hacking these flying security cameras.  2. We put anything that we feel would be a cool additional note, character trivia or something needing further explanation into the bottom text description. Internally my team calls them worldbuilding notes. We don\'t say anything about them, and they\'re usually under the \'cut\'. So the only way our readers know about them is if they click that page. The readers who discover these world building notes absolutely LOVE them. Bonus is that it gives your readers the chance not only to talk about the comic, but put context into how the notes weave into the page, and greater story. They lead to some pretty interesting conversations. \nOkay I lied. I have a third thing you gotta remember when you\'re doing this kinda work. When it comes to ""Show, Don\'t Tell,""  you have to have faith in two things. You must have faith in yourself as a creator, and you must have faith in your readers. Comic readers aren\'t stupid. Trust them to be able to put two and two together.  ', ""Thanks everyone for your input! I'll try and avoid using side notes if I can try and find a better way to convey cultural concepts, and thanks for some of the advice on how I could employ dialogue and context clues ""]",4/7/2017 4:48
301,File size frustrations,Answered,[],"Hi, I'm new and I'm sorry if this is in the wrong spot. I'm having a hard time...
I'm not exactly sure how to change the file size to my comic pages. Is there a certain site that people use to do this or a specific program or can you easily do it anywhere without screwing up the quality?  I just don't know how to easily do it...
Sorry if this has been asked before..","[""How are you creating your pages? If you're making them digitally you should be able to edit the size in that program. For instance: photoshop or manga studio."", 'I draw the pages with a tablet and Manga Studio. I first thought to use ""change image resolution"" to scale them down. \nI guess I\'m just unsure if they\'re scaled down enough (what is acceptable. The help section comic made it seem as though anything in the hundreds like 150 or something like that is too much).', 'You\'re on the right path!\nOn Tapastic, the maximum size of a file is 940x2000 pixels. If you\'re not making a vertical scroll comic, the first number is most important since it dictates the maximum width of a single page. The width can be any number smaller than that, although I wouldn\'t go below 700 - you want to keep the text readable. \nIn CSP, use the change image resolution tool as you are. If you\'re using a template with pixels as the default measurement, just type ""940"" in the width box and the height will automatically downsize. If you\'re using inches instead of pixels, go find a pixel to inch calculator and use whatever number it gives you.I\'d also reccomend saving the resized comic page separately from the full size, full layer file. In case you need to change things or you need a different size, you don\'t want to save over your work!', ""Oh okay. All of my pages are basically 729x1032 (and horizontal is the opposite and it does say that it's too big so I have to fix those). I was so worried about the file size because the pixels sound okay but the kb seemed too big; I'd scale it down so the kb was lower but the pixels were lower (below 700). It sounds like things aren't too bad though. Thank you both for your help!"", ""Manga Studio 4 does the same thing to me. Even though I set the pages a certain size, it still doesn't cooperate with me. I use a converter to change my pages. The tough part about it is, is that I have to do this to every individual page. Just make sure your saving your work too because MS also tends to delete everything and change the formatting of the pages at random too. If you need me to link the converter, just let me know! Good luck! "", 'What might help is if you can ""flatten"" the file. I use photoshop to do this, it should reduce the file size. Paint tool SAI can do this too. I haven\'t figured out how to do it in CSP though.', 'never like that part', 'Hm-m-m, what looked like a pretty straightforward question actually turned out to be a quite interesting research. There are actually many different ways to reduce the file size and it\'s very dependent on which file format you use and for what purpose. My guess is that you are trying to reduce the file size for .PNG or .JPG file for posting your comic page so it should be a pretty straightforward process. \nIn general, when you save .PNG files they have a compression option that lets you reduce the file size without losing quality (as PNG compression is lossless by default) and there are plenty of programs that can reduce .PNG even further by removing some extra data from it – for example, it looks like that PNGOUT plug-in is quite widespread and can be used within several different programs like XNView or IrfanView. By the way, both of these programs can batch convert images so even if there are several files to convert, it shouldn’t be a problem.\nIf you are going to use .JPG format as an output, there are also several options you can fiddle with and besides the usual “Optimize” and ""Quality"" options it looks like you can also choose different sub-sampling methods where some can yield smaller file but with more compression artifacts while other methods can yield bigger file with less artifacts. I think it’s up to you to find out which options are available in your software, whether you want to use additional programs or not and which options will give you best results.\nIf your question was about using other formats for other purposes like storing your working files, it all depends on the format itself and the general usage of that file – you can flatten unnecessary layers, use formats that can compress data and so on, but again, it’s pretty much up to you to find out the best possible solution for your working pipeline.\nAnd by the way, resizing the image, while being the most obvious solution, also has a couple of things to keep track of: since there are various algorithms for upscaling and downscaling, in some cases it makes sense to fiddle with options and see which one has the best output. As far as I can see, most people seem to agree that Lanczos yields best results in most standard cases, but different programs can have different resampling algorithms so it’s hard to tell which one is the best one.And the last but not least – I’ve heard that some people prefer to add text bubbles after the page was resized to its output size so text won’t be affected by compression and downscaling algorithms.']",4/6/2017 17:04
302,Just some questions about starting a comic from a newbie!,Answered,[],"Hi there! Just to introduce myself: I'm Izzy, fifteen years old and (hopefully) starting my first comic soon! I've looked around the forum for some answers to my questions (apologies if they're floating around somewhere and I just haven't been able to find them) but ultimately decided to just make a new topic. Here are some things I want to know:


Is it bad if I can't update regularly? Since I'm still in high school and trying to work hard and get into a good uni, I probably can't update much. I would say maybe a few (3-4) pages updated once per month, maybe more, but definitely not a weekly schedule. I understand that would probably put readers off; should I persist and try to get my comic out there anyway, or is Tapastic just not for me?

How much do I have to script or plan before I start drawing and posting? So far I've got a start and an end in mind, some main characters and backstories, as well as some jigsaw pieces of the plot in the middle. I know it's definitely not enough to start yet, but I was also wondering, when should I? Can I plan as I go along or should I plan the entire thing? I'm thinking 8 volumes of 5 chapters / 120 pages each; would I need to script it all out before I start? And leading onto my next question...

Is that too ambitious for my first comic? I'm keen on trying, but unfortunately self-doubt likes to punch me in the face every once and again.

If I intend to print my comic eventually, should I think about that when I'm deciding on canvas size? I don't want to have to redo things when (or if) I print my comic one day. Should I be worrying about technical things like that or is it too early? And finally...

Do most of you draw your comic on a larger canvas and make it smaller to post here? I believe the maximum width is around 940px if I remember correctly? And personally I find that incredibly small (at least for printing?)

Thanks in advance, and sorry for bombarding you with so many questions!","[""updating irregularly is only bad for you,it limits your exposure only updating a few times a month it also might put some people off. It might be better to just upload in batches.\nfor planning it's different for everybody, some like to plan it all out some dont as the feel constricted to follow the plan which sucks some fun out. For me personally I plan by having basic goals for a chapter or scene and improvised the in between, but there are advantages to both. Planning keeps consistency. Besides your 15 and 8 volumes is a big commitment, you might get bored quick. best thing to do is just start drawing, its going to be bad either way. Its your first but you got too start some time.\nYou never know...but its a good habit to get into now and you'll appreciate it down the road. Yes we all make a larger canvas, i personally do it twice as much but feel free to find something you like."", ""Is it bad if I can't update regularly?If you can't update regularly, I recommend having a buffer of pages, so you can at least upload something once a week. And like Thomassayle above me mentioned, it hurts your exposure, and your fans will never know when they can expect the next update.\nHow much do I have to script or plan before I start drawing and posting?It's best to have your story all planned out, from beginning to end, but don't worry about the details. You just need to know the main things that happen in each chapter, and make sure to maintain the flow of the story without getting wrapped up in the tiny insignificant details. As for scripting, I personally don't think it's necessary to write out EVERYTHING, I know some people do it, but I tend to focus on the script per chapter. If your plan is set up properly you don't have to worry about inconsistencies in your story if you write it per chapter.\nIs that too ambitious for my first comic? I'm in exactly the same boat as you on that one xD I have attempted making long-running comics in the past, but never finished them because I lost interest over time. But if you're dedicated you should be able to pull it off. \nIf I intend to print my comic eventually, should I think about that when I'm deciding on canvas size?Yes, you should. You can look up the standard size for comics, there are several standards. The most important thing is to keep the bleed in mind: that's the part that will be cropped from the printed version, so the canvas has to be bigger than intended.\nDo most of you draw your comic on a larger canvas and make it smaller to post here?Yes, everyone does, if I'm not mistaken. ^^\nI hope that was useful! >.< If you have more questions, just ask away!"", ""Is it bad if I can't update regularly? \nSchool should always come first, so I would encourage you not to worry about how often you can update.  Some people (like myself) do like to create a buffer to work around drawing slumps, but I wouldn't stress too much about it when you're just getting started unless you think it'll help you keep updating, because for some people (again like me) it keeps them more motivated to keep working because the stress of having to hit a deadline on a regular basis can wear them out, while other people, that stress is a motivator, so they don't bother with buffer in the first place.  \nRegular updates are all well and good, but as long as your readers are aware of what's going on, they're usually okay with whatever you need to do.  Regular updates are really only important if you're trying to be a professional (and even professionals need to break up their schedule sometimes)\nHow much do I have to script or plan before I start drawing and posting? \nAs @thomassayle said, planning is different for everybody.  Some people plan as they go, others plan ahead of time, just as long as you do start eventually, there's really no rules on when you should start.  Some of my projects I knew exactly what I wanted going into it, while others, I'm flying on the edge of my seat with the planning.  What you've mentioned just there is absolutely enough to start, in all honesty.  There are definitely people with successful comics out there who've started with less.  \nAnd for that much work, I personally wouldn't try scripting that much before starting.  You're talking years worth of comic right there, and I can guarantee you're going to want to change things along the way as you're working on the art that could force you to either want to rewrite it all long before you hit the end, or make you feel like you have to stick with an idea in the story that you're no longer feeling.  I mean, if you really want to write that much ahead of time, more power to you, but my recommendation is maybe write one or two chapters ahead, and maybe just keep your rough outline on hand.  (But again, some people don't do this.  One of my comics, I don't even have a script for it, because I've never felt like I really needed one.  I just thumbnail the chapter and my edits come in the form of taking my thumbnails and placing them in my page files and looking over the story again, and then a third time when I'm cleaning the roughs up.  Not my recommended way of doing things, as scripts are helpful for helping you feel like your story isn't going off the rails, but its doable)\nIs that too ambitious for my first comic? \n My honest answer is yes.  If you want to make sure you're going to finish it you'll want to start smaller, BUT!!!!! I also think if it's what you want to do that you should absolutely do it.  Being really ambitious helps you learn what your limits are, and dude, some people their first comic really does end up being a thousand page epic.  Who says you won't be one of them?  I would never have learned anything about my own limits if I didn't push myself to the extreme, so I am not one to discourage others from doing the same.  \nIf I intend to print my comic eventually, should I think about that when I'm deciding on canvas size? \nOkay, this one you do need to keep in mind ahead of time.  Standard comic pages are done at 11x17, and you'll want your DPI at 300 DPI or higher (I work in 300, some work as high as 600-700).  If you're planning on doing your comic in color, some would also recommend you stick to CMYK and just change your jpgs or pngs to RGB when uploading (CMYK doesn't always work when uploading on the web, but what you send to printers you'll want to leave in CMYK).  You CAN stick to RGB color mode as printers are getting to the point where it doesn't really matter which you use, but if you want to be safe, use CMYK (this does change how colors will look in your paint program so if something isn't showing up exactly right or how you want it, this is probably why.  CMYK's purpose is to avoid colors that printers can't print)\nIf you want to be really fancy you can also look into methods of preventing color bleed and all that, but that's something you'll probably be okay if you don't really get into until later.  I'm pretty sure most webcomic artists aren't even aware of these and again, they're mostly methods that HAD to be used in the past because comic printers were a lot shittier than they are now.  \nDo most of you draw your comic on a larger canvas and make it smaller to post here? \nAbsolutely, even folks who aren't planning on printing.  If you want to print your comic later and want good quality prints, this is pretty much a requirement, but if you're just doing whatever and don't care if your comic makes it to print, it doesn't really matter if you do or not, but it does make it easier for if you decide to post your pages on other comic sites or even make your own site, as size requirements and recommendations are different depending on where you are."", ""On whether something is too ambitious for your first comic or whether you should plan —\nJust go nuts! I wrote a book when I was 14 (as in, 400 pages, full-length, 24-chapter high-fantasy novel) which is RIDICULOUSLY ambitious. You know why I was able to do that?\nBecause I had no IDEA how hard writing a book was supposed to be. I just went for it and did what I loved and was passionate about. You've got a LOT of time to learn how  be professional/successful at comic making. So lighten up, do what gets you going, and go for the jugular. -C\n\nhttps://tapastic.com/series/ParlorTricks2"", ""Updating:It helps to have a specific update day, but it's not required. Just be honest with your readers and keep them posted when there are going to be long delays.As a couple people have mentioned, a buffer can sometimes help with this: if you're able to do ~4 pages a month, and you work four pages ahead before you start posting, then you can schedule each page to go up once a week so that you have a regular update schedule, but you don't have to finish one page at a regular time to keep up.\nScripting/Planning:As others mention, it depends on what works for you -- there's not really a point where You're Ready To Begin, it's just, when you feel ready to begin. When I started my comic, I had half of the first chapter mostly scripted, some rough ideas for the next four chapters, and a general timeline (that would later be completely rewritten) for the rest of the story. I don't regret starting at that point! If I'd planned any more, i would've had to rewrite it, because I needed the experience of making a comic before I really knew what I needed to plan for making a comic. But thats just my personal experience; others found the most success when they had everything all planned out. Follow your heart!! When you feel ready to go, go for it!!\nRe: too ambitious:A lot of folks will advise a shorter story as a good way to learn how you work, and it's good advice! But if this long story is burning in you and it's the thing that gets you fired up enough to draw, it's better to start with a long story you love than a short story you're ambivalent about. The one piece of advice I'll give if you decide to stick with the long story is to let yourself be flexible. You might want to change the style or techniques you use after drawing the first 50 pages, you might want to shift a character design, you might want to rethink character motivations or change the upcoming plot to be different from what you planned because you had a better idea. These are all normal, and for a first comic that's going to be running for years and years, you don't want to make yourself feel locked in to your earliest choices. Let the comic grow with you."", 'Is it bad if I can\'t update regularly? I would suggest building a buffer first- get a bunch of pages done before you roll out the ""grand opening"" of your comic. That way you can be ahead of the posts, and if something happens that you have to stop to focus on your studies, your comic doesnt suffer.\nHow much do I have to script or plan before I start drawing and posting? That, is entirely up to you- if you have a clear vision on where you want your story to go, then I would say write ahead and save some time, but leave the structure fluid enough if you decide to make changes.\nIs that too ambitious for my first comic? If you plan accordingly, then that elminates a lot of ""ambition""- especially if school/studies is priority.\nIf I intend to print my comic eventually, should I think about that when I\'m deciding on canvas size? Work at a larger size- I dont site specifics via pixels, but I usually work at 11"" x17""(traditionally AND digitally)...I then reduce the size to 7"" x 10"" before doing the lettering. After I do the lettering, I save a copy in the format that is need to upload to Tapastic. 7""x 10"" is also the standard comic book size for print unless you want to use another style of print format.\nDo most of you draw your comic on a larger canvas and make it smaller to post here? Some artists work larger then reduce, while others may work a little smaller.', 'I want to talk about the ""is it too ambitious?"" question primarily. I think it\'s really important for you to know what you\'re getting into.\nIf you have 8 volumes, each being ~120 comic pages, that\'s 960 pages of comic. And at a rate of 4 pages per month:\n960/4 = 240. 240/12 = 20. That means it will take you 20 years to complete it if you don\'t pick up the pace at some point. \nWhich, I\'m sure you\'ll get faster and you\'ll be able to start doing more as you progress! But it\'s something to keep in mind, especially since life has a great way of messing up plans.\nDoing a comic and sticking to it will teach you a lot. It\'s a great way to foster skills like self discipline, scheduling, project management, etc. in ADDITION to the obvious ones like improving your art, pacing, and writing. But I don\'t want you to overwhelm yourself and then beat yourself up if you can\'t do it. I see a lot of artists go through that.\nYou\'re young, and this is a great time to make a lot of things for the sake of it. If this story is YOUR BABY, and you think you would regret doing it now and potentially having to drop it because you don\'t have time, or if you want it to be perfect and won\'t allow yourself mistakes, I would either find a way to cut down the story by half (and be okay moving on from it because you\'ll have newer, better ideas as you progress) or think up something shorter that is super fun for you but you\'re not INVESTED in long term.\nPersonally I think a project for your situation should fit these criteria:+ Fun to do+ Low pressure to do it well (quantity over quality in this case)+ Start small and expand if the story opens up organically.+ Small scope/expectations for how it does online+ Not being devastated if you have to set it aside one day\nFor example, in my junior and senior year in high school (I was 16/17) I literally did a page of comic every school day. It was on lined notebook paper, and usually with pen, following the misadventures of my teachers re-imagined as sea life creatures fighting against aliens. Me and my friend would go to my teacher\'s room (who was the main character) after school each day and give it to him to see his reaction. It was wacky and silly, but eventually grew to have a plot. I didn\'t care if it was pretty and I was invested on a personal level, even played with the idea of redoing the pages to make something of it, but in retrospect it was great for what it was: a building block.\nDespite them being crappy, I ended up learning a lot about pacing, different kinds of panels, and bubble placement from it. It helped my fundamentals without being bogged down by a need for perfection. You don\'t have to swing it to be as quick and crappy as mine were, but that\'s the kind of thing I think would help you most. \nOf course, my experience is one in millions, so if you feel strongly about a different path, do that. Best of luck no matter what you choose!', ""I'm fairly new at this too, but I'll do my best to give advice that helped me get started.\nIs it bad if I can't update regularly? \nWhen it comes to updating, I agree with the others. It's better to have a solid update schedule and to update weekly if possible. \nYou say you think you can make about 3 or 4 pages a month, so if you can't manage to do one page a week, then I'd recommend building a buffer. \nI'm currently taking a break from school (I know I won't be able to draw as much when I start taking classes again), so I'm spending a bunch of time drawing the pages. I launched my comic this week, but it was after already finishing 14 pages. If you can finish a bunch of pages and then launch that could help you have a regular update schedule.\nHow much do I have to script or plan before I start drawing and posting?\nTo be honest, the most important thing is to have an ending in mind. Scripting the whole thing out didn't work very well for me because I always write too much dialogue when I write a script. So I ended up doing layouts by chapter based on this video:\nyoutube.com/watch?v=1c1LFjD59lA\nObviously it might not work for you how it worked for me, but it was helpful and helped me get out of my creative rut so I'm sharing it.\nIs that too ambitious for my first comic? \nOne of the best pieces of advice I got when I was starting out is that your first webcomic should not be a project to close to your heart and do you should come up with a different idea to start off with. I came up with my idea and it was supposed to be a ten part mini-series, but it ended up expanding past as I fleshed out the characters and worlds, but it's still a smaller idea than any of the ones I've been working on for  a really long time. \nStarting with a different project will give you room to grow and mess up in ways you might be afraid to do with a project that's really important to you. (Though if your anything like me, the project will become important to you.)\nIf I intend to print my comic eventually, should I think about that when I'm deciding on canvas size?\n Yea, if you intend to print you'll want a more standard size. I can't give you much advice on that front because I formatted my webcomic for tapastic and tumblr. If you need any advice on formatting for the web though I'd be happy to help!\nDo most of you draw your comic on a larger canvas and make it smaller to post here?\nYes, it's kind of necessary to start off bigger if you want room to draw."", ""\n\nyueu:\nIs it bad if I can't update regularly?\nitll make gaining subscribers harder. some people care a lot about the reliability, and either way people will lose interest over time. that said, it wont stop you from gaining subscribers, just slow the process.\nid say your best bet is to not start posting your comic until youve made something like 50 pages (or, post them on a tumblr at a page whenever you make it, but not on tapastic until 50 or so) so you can maintain regular updates even if you cant draw regularly. with your kinda schedule, which i imagine is already quite busy, this could lead to your buffer running out every so often, in which case youll take a hiatus to build it back up again.\n\n\nyueu:\nHow much do I have to script or plan before I start drawing and posting?\nthe more you plan now, the less stress itll be later.\nid say, at the very least, bulletpoint out your story. all its plot points. if you get stuck, think backwards (so this happens at the end - why? because plot point y. why did y happen? because x. because w. etc til u get to where you got stuck)\nat most, write your entire story. in its basics; dialogue and actions, plus maybe how the characters feel. look at films scripts for inspiration maybe, or plays if you want sparser scripts. this is long and can be boring but it means you can catch any important plot points you tend to stumble on as you get into the flow of writing, and means you can make any edits to your scene and character designs you want or need before you start drawing pages\n\n\nyueu:\nIs that too ambitious for my first comic?\nit is if you wanna stick to a tight schedule. because shit will go wrong, on your first go. youll take a sudden hiatus to improve your art, or for exams, or because its not whats in your head and its really bogging you down. but if youre gentle with yourself schedule wise (be gentle, always) then i dont think so. if youre worried about not doing the story justice, you can always redo it when youre a bigshot professional.\nfor this first comic, accept that its gonna be a lil awkward, and over time youll come to hate the early pages and youll change so many things half way through because this is your space to experiment and learn and figure out how to make comics and art and writing work for you. dont get boxed into a stylistic choice or drawing style you grow to hate just because thats how you started the comic. change drastically and unapologetically, and take note on what youll do better next time. eventually, you wont be able to do this, but right now you can.\n\n\nyueu:\nIf I intend to print my comic eventually, should I think about that when I'm deciding on canvas size?\nthe bigger the better. im talking bigger. use the biggest canvas your computer wont freeze working with (when you have 3 or so completed pages open, with layers, and your computers throwing a hissy fit id say thats your limit)\nyou can always scale down, but scaling up is a bitch. that prolly answered your last question too.\ngood luck, man. youre gonna be awesome - eventually. everyones allowed a crap phase, rejoice in it, remember that youre a superstar next to yesterdays you."", ""Thank you all so much for your advice and answers; I really, really appreciate it! I'll definitely be building a buffer, so thanks to all those who suggested that! I think over the next week or so I'll work on just outlining my entire plot and hopefully developing my world and characters further. I'm going to stick to my current long story idea knowing it'll probably be incredibly hard and not turn out GREAT, but hey, I'm really loving the concept and it'll be a fun first comic.\nI do have some follow up questions:\n\nWhen I said I can't update regularly, I didn't mean I'll have erratic updates as much as I mean't I can't update very often. Would waiting a between a fortnight to a month for updates put people off? I've been browsing some comics here to get a good idea of how often people update, and some of them update daily! Is releasing, say, five pages a month too slow?Also, is taking a hiatus (giving notice beforehand to readers, for example, because of exams) something that's tolerated?\n\nI've looked at standard comic book sizes a bit, and I was wondering if the sizes are international? Because I've never come across these before (especially since we don't use imperial units where I live)! Or maybe I've just been living under a rock with little to no comic book knowledge. Is it particularly difficult to print custom size (I was thinking 15px width, 20px height), perfect bound comics? Since I've realised that the common service printing companies offer is standard comic book size saddle-stitched products?\n\nAgain, thank you so much for the helpful replies and encouragement!"", ""I update my comic every 2 weeks with 3-5 pages because it's a long form story that doesn't do as well with single page updates. I don't know if I would push it to a monthly update though, I think people would forget about it faster and not stay invested. Maybe you could do something similar and schedule 2-3 pages every 2 weeks?\nThat said, if you really want to do a monthly update, that would still be okay. Consistency in when your readers should expect an update is always better than being sporadic.\nUnfortunately, comic sizes aren't standard internationally from what I've seen. I know there are comparable sizes between countries, but they tend to be slightly different (Or maybe it's just America that's weird since we're backwards and won't convert measurement systems!!). I use the american manga size so I can't really help much on that front, sorry. :x  \nIf you can look up some printers in your country, check out their printing options and download some templates if they have them. That'll give you the size you need. Just remember it's always gotta be at least 300dpi and include a bleed. \nHere's an example from a U.S. printer:4\nThe red is your bleed. You need to draw your art all the way out to the edge of the document so that when it's trimmed, the printer has a margin of error. Where the red meets the yellow is the trim line, this is where the printer will cut the paper. The blue is your safe area--you shouldn't have any word bubbles or important imagery beyond this point, otherwise it runs the risk of getting trimmed off."", ""\n\nrevisionstudios:\nI update my comic every 2 weeks with 3-5 pages because it's a long form story that doesn't do as well with single page updates. I don't know if I would push it to a monthly update though, I think people would forget about it faster and not stay invested. Maybe you could do something similar and schedule 2-3 pages every 2 weeks?\nAh cool, thanks for this info! I'll consider it once I build up a buffer and get a better grip of how quickly I can work. \nAnd about the bleed; I've been seeing lots of posts mentioning it and I understand what it is and why it's important but, wouldn't the obvious solution be to just draw your page normally and extend your canvas to include a larger margin afterwards? This mostly applies for comics where there's a blank border or margin around it, but I don't see why you can't go back and just add the bleed area to your page and add to your drawings  that touch the edge of the page a bit after? Is there something I'm missing here?"", ""I mean, I guess you CAN add extra after the fact when you're preparing your comic for print, but why give yourself more work? I would hate myself SO MUCH if I had to go back and edit the 160 pages I had to account for bleed. (I already hated myself for having to insert all the page numbers. Geez.) \nIf you really feel you're going to keep your comic contained with a border all around it and the art never overflows, it may not be an issue. But it's so much easier to just draw the panel a little further while you complete the page and then save a different, resized version for web.\nHere's one of my pages with the bleed line. Keep in mind, I play it way safe and do a half inch border on every side. Yours doesn't have to be this excessive, probably---but do you see why it would be crazy for me to try and draw the bleed later?\n\nLike I said before, the printer needs a bleed because it won't trim 100% correctly every time. It's just a margin of error.\nYou've also gotta be aware of where your spine is, lest your word bubbles or important images get lost in the center. You don't want people trying to pull the book apart trying to read it. It depends on your page placement, but I now know that if the page is an odd number, the spine is on the left, and if it's an even number, the spine is on the right. That way I can avoid putting important content next to the spine.\nIt honestly takes a lot of organization and structure to streamline the process of making something both for digital and print. You're going to have to learn a lot about formats, dpi, color profiles, sizes, and more. Just comes with the territory."", 'Ah cool, thanks for this info, I definitely understand it a lot better.

303,What should I do? Single or multiple pages per episode?,Answered,[],"I've seen a couple of topics that ask something similar, but I'd like to know what you think I should do for my comic.Currently I have scheduled my uploads to one page per day, but I'm thinking about uploading multiple pages in one episode per week (that would be around 7 pages, one for each day of the week I would have otherwise uploaded). The main reasons I might want this is because I'm going to end up with hundreds of episodes, and it might be off-putting for new readers (?), and I'm also uploading on Webtoons, 7 pages per episode on weekly basis, so I kinda want to keep things consistent.
I don't plan on removing and re-uploading the pages I currently have, I don't want to and it's too much work.  Also, my comic style is standard comic pages, which I plan to keep as well (so I'm not switching to webtoon style paneling). 
Considering all this, do you think I should just stick to the single-page episodes I have now? Or go for multiple pages per episode per week? What do you prefer in general?
Here's my comic: https://tapastic.com/series/Pandemonium13","['personally, i prefer weekly updates to daily ones - its too often, so i can easily get fed up if im not really into the story. 7 pages in an update is good and bulky, so itd be good for a weekly update - you could even slim down to four a week, and refine those pages, or take breaks, or build more buffer.\nweekly, bigger updates > daily, smaller updates because- its less intimidating to new readers because its less episodes- people get more each update, so theyre less likely to lose interest- you only need to worry about that pageturn factor every 7 pages- you can upload pages early on patreon for some $$$', ""Thanks for your comment! I'm definitely swaying more towards the weekly updates now."", ""I like weekly update more with more content than a page a day. Simply because a weekly update already disturb the rhythm of your entire chapter so imagine what it does if you upload one page a day ?I'm more immerge with longer update, the wait doesn't matter.Plus, if you can make 5-7 pages a week, you can plan your narration and sometime put a cliffhanger-ish ending to your update which is always appreciated ^^\nAnd like punkarsenic said, you can also set up a patreon for those who want to read your work early."", ""The downside on weekly bulk episodes on tapas is the loss in revenue though. You'd get less views.But I do think most readers prefer weekly episodes. I recently started on webtoons and asked the people what they'd prefer, I think 80% voted for the weekly bulk updates."", ""@nixxusnibelheim Thanks for your input! I guess most people don't mind waiting, as long as they get an enjoyable episode.\n@Lucazu Yeah, that was the reason that I started the one-per-day in the first place, but I think I'd prefer catering to my current fans rather than amassing new ones. Plus I don't get much from the revenue anyway, I can miss those extra pennies.

I often ignore all the daily update comic that I subscribed to for a beautiful day to sit down and binge read all the pages that piled up anyway LMFAO"", ""@hawthornearts I see ^^ Thanks for commenting! My art style is very easy and quick for me to make  on a free day I  can make up to 5 pages depending on their complexity.\n@69Erocento I guess there's a lot of my readers who do that too, since the viewed number is more often much less than the number of subscribers xD and I've only got 'weekly' votes so far, so I guess it's been decided ^^  Thanks for your input!""]",3/29/2017 5:09

It would happen around Junior/Senior year, soooo yeah.
Got any input?","[""If there's a significant reason for it being 16 (Freshman/Sophomore) then I don't see why not. If the story can still be told through a 17 year old then do that instead. I know there's a difference in 16 and 17 as far as maturity so if you're trying to analyze something about a 16 year olds personal mind set then there shouldn't be an issue. Story telling is about looking at another perspective outside our own. If the reader has to be put into the mindset of being 16 then we'll just have to do so as that is a coming of age time for most adolescent.\nJust don't actually show like the sex penetration part or anything..."", ""Yeah absolutely not!

The states are very confusing in that regard as one state might have the age of consent set at 16 which the next state over it's 18, so anyone reading the comic in states where consent is 17 or 18 could get in trouble. it also depends on where you live as well or you might get in trouble\nIf you have things censored and tastefully done then I don't see why it would be a big deal though."", ""As long as you don't show it, there's really no limit.

As for how you would go about bring up a subject when it involves minors, I\'d say tell don\'t show. You can certainly imply that two consenting teenagers fucked (i.e a passionate make out session with the ""camera"" panning away before anything explicit is shown), but depending on the kind of comic you are writing, it would probably be easier (and bring you a lot less drama) if for example, a guy character of yours (lets say a Jock stereotype) was bragging to his guy friends in passing about how his girlfriend let him get to third base with her the previous night or what have you.\nOr another example, a single guy who feels like crap because he\'s not getting any while all his guy friends allegedly are or a girl who worries her ""friends"" might think she\'s a ""slut"" if she goes on a date and proceeds to make out with a cute guy from her math class.

311,How much does Tapastic pay?,Answered,[],"How much does it pay for views? I heard Webtoon pays a good amount, what about Tapastic?","[""Here's1.4k how much Webtoons is currently paying. As you can see, it's not based on just views; there are other requirements as well, namely subscriber count (at least 3k) and the number of updates (at least 2 updates) within a month. Note that this is a limited time event. They're not going to do this forever. \nTapastic has an ad revenue thing which pays for ad impressions (which is related to views), but honestly that's just pennies. The new tipping program pays out much more for many creators. The tip money comes from your readers, rather than Tapastic, so the amount would depend on how much your readers tip you.\nThen there's something completely different: the featured comics on Webtoons. Creators of those comics get paid a lot more. Not everyone can join their ranks, however. Webtoons has to notice you and decide they want to add your comic to that list. "", 'Great to know!  Thanks!', 'The ad revenue on Tapastic remains in continued decline.  Michael said once that its a ""race to the bottom"".  Adblockers are experiencing double digit growth and over 30% of all US browsers now have adblock.  On top of that Wall Street Journal reports 30% of all internet traffic is Russian/Eastern European bots that refresh ads tens of thousands of times driving up impressions and costing advertisers millions in lost advertising money.  The bots are paid kickbacks by third parties.  There was a time when some creators on Tapastic were using these third parties to send tons of bot traffic to Tapastic to run up ads but they\'ve been since removed from the site.\nWhat this all means is that display advertising is rapidly losing its value.  30% of US users don\'t see the ads, 30% of the ads are just bots, so only 40% of the ads are actually seen by a pair of human eyes.  Click thru rates are now 1 in 1000 which means it takes 1,000 impressions for someone to click an ad.  A lot of advertisers want $10 CPM, or $10 for 1,000 impressions, which means $10 a click.  If you are selling cars, no problem, if you are selling things with a margin under $10, each click will be a net loss.\nThis is why you are seeing CPMs falling more and more.  Before DeviantArt closed up their third party administered ads, they were going for as low as $.04 CPM.  In other words, 2,500,000 impressions for $100.  If you look at Project Wonderful, a lot of the bidding there is comparable to that.  \nIn order words don\'t make Tapastic ads a part of your revenue plans.\nDisplay ad revenue is on the way out.  Which is why Tapastic decided to switch gears to tipping.  Fortunately video ads have much higher engagement rate and advertisers are willing to pay well for it.  Hopefully that lasts for the long term but nothing is for certain.  Which is why Tapastic is also looking at offering other coin earning opportunities (no idea what they are).  Perhaps they will go into the survey business which is crowded but appears strong and perhaps even micro tasks.  As more coin opportunities open up tipping should become more and more vibrant and a possible alternative or supplement to Patreon revenue.', 'Briefly put, it pays peanuts ', ""That's detailed info, Golden, Thank you :3 Too bad it's going down, indeed.\nDoes anyone else remember the survey on tapas? This was months ago. The survey asked what people thought of the idea to let people pay to read scheduled pages.I wonder what happened to that."", ""I do, too.

The survey asked what people thought of the idea to let people pay to read scheduled pages.I wonder what happened to that.\nIt was a theoretical feature that never got to the design stage. \nWe opted to focus on the tipping program instead. We felt that tipping and that feature would introduce too many competing elements. We wanted to go with a simpler system that could be utilized by more creators. \nHope that explains things ']",3/1/2017 20:04

Just a tip so that it's easier to actually create words: after 2 or 3 letters, start suggesting words that could be spelled with the current set of letters.Let's see how many words we can create or how many times we'll fail.

339,Which version of this story should I go with?,Answered,[],"Ok, so I'm putting together a pitch for an upcoming comic anthology, and I have two different versions of the story I want to pitch. The anthology4 is looking for stories about small anthropomorphized animals, in all genres including horror. 
The story starts out the same in both versions. Two rats are captured by a taxidermist. One is taken away to be stuffed, and the other tries to rescue them. When the rescuer rat tries to find its mate, however, they stumble into a room full of Walter Potter3 inspired taxidermy, dead animals stuffed in human like positions and situations and  wearing tiny clothes. Picture something like this: http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01737/cats-wedding_1737761i.jpg6 The rat has no context for any of this, though and just wonders why none of these animals will move or talk and why they all have bits of cloth on them.
This is where the story splits. In version A the taxidermied animals are magical. After the protagonist rat discovers their mate stuffed and incorporated into a diorama, all of the animals come to life and descend on the protagonist. Cut to black. When the sun comes up the next morning the protagonist has become one of the stuffed animals.
In version B there is no supernatural element. Instead the rat has to avoid a live cat that's stalking the room. They find the stuffed body of their mate, like in the other version, but this time they escape with the body. Being a rat however, they do not comprehend the concept of taxidermy and don't understand that their mate is dead. The story ends with the protagonist being upset that the other rat never talks to them anymore.
You'll notice that I used gender neutral pronouns for the rats. That's because I haven't totally decided on their genders, yet. I have this idea that when the protagonist finds their dead mate, the body will be either the bride or the groom in a wedding scene, standing alone at the alter, waiting for them. I don't want to play into the damsel in distress trope, but I do very much want to draw a rat in a wedding dress. 
What do you think? Which version is better? any advice?","[""I like version B better. It feels like a more complete story and there's more mystery and horror to it."", ""I prefer it without a supernatural element, but I also find it too unrealistic that the rat wouldn't be able to understand that a taxidermied animal was dead. The smell and lack of movement and warmth would surely be very obvious to a rat. \nI do really like the overall idea, though. Perhaps you could imply the rescuer rat is trapped by the taxidermist at the end, with the other wedding outfit awaiting them, to incorporate part of idea A without the supernatural element."", 'I also prefer B! I think for the kinds of stories that Tim\'rous Beastie is going for, the exact realism of whether or not rats recognise stuffed dead animals isn\'t really necessary --  I actually prefer the quirky darkness of the ""they never talk to me"" ending over one where the rescuer rat just fails and is captured.\nkristintipping7:I don\'t want to play into the damsel in distress trope, but I do very much want to draw a rat in a wedding dress.\n(One option: the husband is captured, and put in a wedding dress, because the taxidermist doesn\'t care what the actual gender of the rats is and it\'s not gonna be obvious to anyone who isn\'t a rat.)', ""Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I think I've worked out what I want to do now. The final version is kind of a combination of both versions with some new elements added in as well.""]",12/28/2016 12:54

351,Curse Words in Comics?,Answered,[],"Hey, guys! Here's a strange question that just crossed my mind. Are we allowed to have curse words in the comics? If we do, do we have to label it in some way?","['Yes we are allowed to have curse words, and here is the relevant passage from Tapastic\'s content policy: \nAdult Material: Tapastic ALLOWS mature content featuring nudity, non-graphic sex, extreme violence, and strong language as long as it is behind our NSFW filter. Tapastic DOES NOT ALLOW pornography or hateful content that targets a specific person or group of any kind. Any content deemed unsuitable that is not behind our NSFW will be requested to take action. Failure to comply with this request will result in the image being taken down. Repeat offenses will result in the suspension or removal of the user’s account.\nI\'d say you can get away with a few four-letter words without needing to bother with the NSFW-filter - no one is going to get in a tizzy over a few ""damn""s or ""shit""s thrown in here and there in regular conversation - but if there is going to be very frequent swearing, and it\'s going to be very foul, then you might want to consider the NSFW-filter.', ""Yes!  You may indeed.  And if you still feel awkward about it, context is huge.  If it's particularly explicit material (gauging what kid of language being used in-line with what is being discussed), a NSFW filter would be your safest bet.  Again, emphasis on CONTENT. Like Anna said, occasional curse words are nothing to bat an eye at.  But if you have excessive and offensive speech in your comic that single out individuals or cultures, you may want to re-think tapastic as your platform for sharing.\nThat said... I do wonder where tapastic stands on imbuing your comic with curses?  The cursed webcomic has potential after all. X]"", ""Alright, thanks! This makes life easier. I'll keep that in mind."", ""Go for itSo long as it's not racist or anything"", 'I keep my profanities pretty light with the exception of the B-word. I\'ll use ""damn"", ""hell"", and occasionally ""bitch"", but I wont use the heavy hitters.', 'I never have seen where curse words add anything to a comic. I was told it showed a lack of command of the English language. That said, what is wrong with crap, ouch, and darn?', 'Because it can be used as a literary tool to define and shape a character through their dialogue? How aggressively, often, and colorfully a character swears can say a lot about their personality, including impulsiveness, handle on rage, etc. In my comic, the two lead characters have completely opposite approaches to talking---Lexi curses pretty regularly and colorfully, whereas Vespyr very rarely curses at all except when highly stressed or angry. This is just a small detail in the dialogue that helps further differentiate the characters.\nI think that IRL, if you prefer not to swear that is totally respectable and up to you, but to claim that using swear words is equivalent to having a poor grasp on the English language is just a little ignorant to how swear words can be used to help define a character given the right context in a comic.', 'Well cussing can add a lot to characterization. You get a different impressions of a person of a person who says ""crap"" vs a person who says ""shit"" versus a person who says ""goddamn motherf*cking son of hell."" In some cases, it\'s just not realistic to limit your swears to crap, ouch, etc. because that\'s not how all people talk in real life. If you have a high school setting, for example, unless the school is extremely traditional it would be weird to not see some rebellious teenagers throwing cusses around. Or another example would be the army/navy, we have the phrase ""swears like a sailor"" for a reason.', ""Please Doo not confuse my remarks as referring to the creator.I have children and grandchildren. They read comics. I have grown up with comics and some that were supposed to be comics and were actually pornography slipped in Cracker Jack boxes in the 1940s. I know the effect they can have on a child's mind."", 'I mean, you can always follow ""I Hate Fairyland""\'s example...  but while it fits perfectly with that comic, I highly doubt it would fit with other titles ;D Plus I think that the way a character talks defines them just as much as their looks, so I wouldn\'t remove it if one of the character is just the type of person to swear a lot (:', '@r0ckrabbi7 I LOVE I Hate Fairyland!

The comic I work on has quite a bit of colorful language, but we do our best to reel it back. I feel like if you\'re going ""Good Will Hunting"" levels of cursing then yeah, put it behind a NSFW wall, otherwise I think you\'re fine. \nOne of the ways we get around it in Kamikaze6 is by creating our own vernacular. Instead of saying something like ""fuck"" we\'ll use ""dust."" So you get phrases such as ""what the dust?"" or ""dusting hell!"" The world our comic is set in is a dustbowl environment, so my team felt like it was a great way to add to the world building. A lot of our readers find it fun to read, and some of them have told us they\'ve actually adopted the phrase themselves. xD \nSome examples of pages that use ""dust"" as an expletive: \n26\n18', ""Yes you would think that would be allowed given you're portraying a CHARACTER as frothing racist and don't share the same views but that distinction is easily lost. I'd avoid it just to be on the safe side."", 'I always wonder why people want to use straight out curses in comics when for decades, the medium has devised its own alternative as in\n(*(@fRY&Y4778y4 ) which works much better and is much more fun to letter...', 'I see a lot of people questioning why you\'d use cursing at all in comics, and I guess I\'ll offer my own ideas on the subject as a filthy newbie who gives not an ounce of a fuck about past comic regulations and the need to keep everything kid friendly.\nCursing in comics isn\'t necessary in every situation but there are many situations where cursing is required for basic believability.  There are bound to be characters with rage issues, characters who grew up in bad parts of town, characters who serve in the military, or sail. It would make no sense to have a big, burly, sour old sailor saying ""dag-nabbit"" and ""gosh"" constantly. It would completely change the tone into a comedic or outright stupid one.\nEven outside of contexts where cursing is almost required, people in the real world curse. It makes sense to also make characters who curse. Even my god-fearing prim as can be great grandmother will let out a hard cuss if she stubs her toe on something.\nFurthermore, many webcomics are already at a point they clearly aren\'t meant to be read by kids. This site, as an example, seems to be half porny yaoi comics. Not exactly something I\'d let my kid read. If people think they can express what they\'re aiming to in their comics better with the use of cursing and cussing more power to them. It should be marked clearly if it reaches racist, or excessive levels, but throwing out the idea of using cussing entirely in a comic just because it\'s a comic strikes me as incredibly silly.', 'I use words like ""damn"", ""bitch"", and ""bastard"". Yes they are bad words but I don\'t think they are bad enough for a NSFW filter.\nHowever there are times when I want to use the f-word....so I do this. We all know what she\'s saying but it is not NSFW.\nIf you are really worried about cursing, and you want to use it. You can use stars, symbols, or wing-dings.', 'I only put the NSFW filter on for language if the word is in really big text. But that\'s because I take ""NSFW"" quite literally, and I reckon a page with lots of dialogue and one little whoopsie-daisy F-word isn\'t likely to turn heads in the office, while a gigantic nuke of an F-bomb that takes up an entire panel? Yeah, I\'m putting the filter on for that, I\'m not getting anyone fired XD\nAnd I got nothing to add regarding the merits of swearing in comics that hasn\'t been said already : )']",9/11/2016 0:12

So since the banner size is 1280x460Whenever I draw my banner and upload it, there's always a portion of it missing!

Like when I upload it on the ""Edit Comic"" it looks complete. But once I go to my actual page with my comicIt shows up incompletely, and it bothers me, because when I try to resize it, the same thing happens! XD
Is it a problem with my computer screen? I seem to see other people's banners just fine. You can go check out for yourself, just go to my comic ""Sons of Ra"" and you'll see that the banner is all messed up.So if someone can please help, that would be very appreciated!","[""First - how much of your banner is visible will vary depending on what device you're using to view the comic; it will look different on a phone than it does on a desktop computer, for example. This might be what's happening here. \nSecond - this is what I see when I go to your comic. \n \nWhat part of it is messed up?"", ""Seconding Anna -- what you're probably seeing is that the website shifts the image around and crops it so that it fits the page no matter what size your browser or screen is, so you'll very rarely see the entire image.

365,Any one have advice for emotional scenes in comics?,Answered,[],"Sorry for the hard question but, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for making the reader cry when I want them to? Like any key elements that will make the reader cry in a tragic scene. (the real struggle for me is the fact that the only two characters in the comic are mute)","['There is no guaranteed way to make your readers cry when you want them to. It\'s not like there\'s a box of story-elements you can just reach into that says ""Crying"" on it. And people get emotional over different things, so it can be hard to predict what they\'ll react to anyway. \nHowever, there are a few things you can do to make your emotional scenes perhaps impact better. And this goes for emotional scenes in general, not just tragedy. \nMake the readers invested in the charactersSpend time in the story on making your readers familiar with a character, and give them reasons to care. Maybe your character is on some kind of important mission, and if they fail something bad will happen; your readers will care about the success of the mission. Craft characters that have something they care about - that way, readers will have a higher chance of caring about them. \nRaise the stakesSo your character has an important mission, and failure means bad things happening. How can you turn that into an emotionally impactful scene? \nThreaten failure. \nGive your character a challenge to their mission. Maybe someone steps in and tries to stop them, maybe they lose something important that could have helped them, maybe they tried to complete their mission and failed for some reason, and now they have to race against time to get to try again. \nDeliver on your promisesIf you\'ve been threatening failure, have it happen. If you\'ve been writing the story in such a way that one character has been in mortal danger for a long time - maybe someone is out to kill them? - then deliver on that. Have the trap snap shut. \nA little goes a long wayThere\'s a scene in the absolute travesty that is the live-action DragonBall movie, in which Goku falls to his knees beside the corpse of his grandfather - whom we\'ve, uh, hardly seen on screen ^_^; - and raises his hands to the sky, screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" at the top of his lungs. It\'s terrible, it\'s badly written, and it\'s horrendously over-acted - and as a result, I just don\'t care. \nSometimes, you get a bigger emotional impact if you do something small. Sometimes a bundle of flowers on a gravestone is more emotional than someone clinging to a dead body bawling their eyes out.', ""Making readers cry is actually easier than making them laugh out loud. I've gathered plenty reader tears myself so here are some pointers from personal experience:\n1) Authenticity. If it doesn't make you as the author sad, chances are it won't move anyone else. When you're writing a sad scene you're putting part of your own sadness in it, something that moves you personally. Readers pick up on non-authentic tear-jerker scenes surprisingly easy! \n2) Timing. You should give the reader time to get to know your characters. At the beginning of the story, your readers don't know your characters from a bar of soap. Something bad happening to them at that point is only mildly interesting, yawn~. If they've followed them through up and downs and grown attached to them then the same event becomes tragic. \n3) Unfairness. Life is not fair. If life is not fair to a beloved character then that is bound to get emotional. If a character struggled for something and still loses then those who followed them throughout the journey will feel that burn. (lol, pun intended)\n4) Everyone cries when a pet dies. Not everyone cries when a kid dies. Children characters have a tendency to get really annoying so making them sympathetic is often much harder than it is for adult characters. On the other hand, Fluffy dying will always get the waterworks. \n5) Shock value in itself is worthless. The tragic event should make ripples (or even tsunamis) in the other characters' lives. If everything returns to normal right away readers will feel both cheated and disappointed and for good reason! Tragic events often scar people for life, the story should reflect that as well."", ""Tough one but I'll try and explain what I think helps:\nEmotional investment in the character witnessing the scene, not the victim themselves\nThis has already been mentioned, but by the time my emotional scene came along we were already invested in Jed, the main character and the one witnessing the scene. We knew by that point that he was a good person (at least in the sense that he's kind enough to help a stranger and have a good sense of humour about it) so as a very simply storytelling tool he acts as a clear indicator of how the reader is supposed to be feeling at any given time. Obviously how you set up your witness is a big deal and seeing a character display emotions, do things, and say things they never have before simply because they can't contain their emotions is pretty intense.\nEmpathy from one character and another\nI believe seeing anyone try to provide comfort to someone under duress invokes a sense of something in a healthy human being. Don't underestimate the power of a few gentle words or a hand on someone's shoulder. Even a secret wink to provide confidence is an expression of empathy and seeing those small displays really resonates with people. \nDraping a blanket over someone who's sleeping, walking away from the sound of someone sobbing because you know they value privacy, telling a child a funny story to distract them from something terrible going on outside-- these actions can be as big or small as you like but working them into emotional scenes is a great way of reminding people who it is that needs help at that point in time.  \n Remember that scene from Good Will Hunting? You probably know the one I mean, it's a heart breaker, and there are some really subtle moments of comfort giving shown there.  \n1\nExpressions\nPretty obvious, this one, but the better you are at communicating a feeling outside of 'I am upset' the easier it will be for readers to understand the depth of someone's feeling.\n  \nCharacter awareness\nI see a lot of betrayal scenes happening these days where someone intentionally or unintentionally back stabs someone else and while those all well and good I've always found, personally, that the most gut wrenching of scenes are those in which the character knows what's coming and simply has to accept it. I find it appeals to a very specific type of dread and anxiety- the kind you share with a school mate when you realise you've been caught red handed. There's something very humanising about seeing someone acknowledge they've made a mistake and keep a stiff upper lip as they deal with the consequences- whatever they may be- and even more in seeing them not keep a stiff upper lip and fight desperately to fix things until the very end. Knowing someone will betray you, knowing you're going to die, knowing you're going to lose someone else, knowing you can't escape, knowing you can't deny it, knowing you can't take it back, it's emotional TNT so play around with it and employ awareness to work with you in emotional scenes. \nyoutube.com/watch?v=bIZOThexnwg"", ""I don't think there is any garentee way to make someone cry for an emotional part in your story. But you can maybe make them feel things. For me personally, digging deep inside yourself really helps. Feel the situation and get a feel of how powerful it could be. Know what your character is going through. Be in that moment with them. Cry... it sounds weird but you have to know how they feel. You are only person who can understand them better than they understand themselves. Know why that moment is so powerful to them. Because I your reader will definitely catch on and understand. Feel it in your stomach, feel it in your mind, feel it in your heart...."", ""Most everything relevant has been said already. I'll only add that the aftermath of whatever is emotional is important. Oh so important!\nI'll use the reboot of The Tomb Raider as an example. When (the new) Lara Croft kills someone for the first time, she nearly throws, hyperventilates, shakes and can barely speak. It's an effective scene (maybe not the most emotional, but it is noticeable and serves as a good example). In the very next gameplay scene she's toting guns and shooting fools like a seasoned veteran. Completely eradicating the impact of the previous scene. In my mind that ruined what might've been a pivotal moment for he character and he development.\nI've read in an interview with th wonderful Rihanna Pratchett that there was some disconnect between the writers and the people who worked on the gameplay so I won't fault her too much for that.""]",8/21/2016 2:33

Why does some people have fancy banners on their comics when I only get that yellow board that means ""comedy"". As you can se: http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/magic-advisor/list?title_no=33962554
When I search for my comic it looks like this: 

 
But when I look at the people on the first page their comics look like this: 
 
Where do I upload that kind of picture?

Those features like comic banners and different icons are only exclusive to creators who have comics feature on Line and are paid by Line.', 'Nevermind, I misread you.', 'To add to @Tanisha\'s reply, LINE Webtoon offers two ""ways"" to read comics. \nFirst off, is the Featured section. When you stop by the main page of LINE, and see comics like the ones you\'ve listed above, you\'re seeing the comics that are paid to publish on LINE. These are series that are generally very popular and LINE is willing to pay to get their content on a regular basis (a schedule which LINE sets for creators - so some series post every Wednesday, some series post every day, it\'s sorta like a neat TV guide for comics and the creators are paid to update on their specific days). \nThen there\'s the Discover section. Discover is where you and other creators who are posting for free - and not getting paid by LINE - post and showcase your work. These comics do not get featured on the front page, though there are popular sections/trending/etc. respective to the Discover section ( just not on the front page). \nOnly Featured comics on the front page that are paid to be featured get fancier banners with more of a polished work, simply to give the front page a more unified look.', 'Oh I see! Thank you so much for clearing that up! I really appreciate it. I thought I had missed something about where I could upload a banner but now I understand.  Thank you!']",8/11/2016 16:59

374,Wesite woes! Removing the series icon from embedded tapastic comics?,Answered,[],"So I just realized this question sounds super sketchy, lol. I'm trying to revamp my website2 a bit, and I want to make a gallery of comics within the site instead of just linking to them like I am now. The only way I've figured out to put a  long scrolling comic on the site without the Weebly throwing a fit is to embed it from tapstic. The only problem with that is the username and series icon that appears at the top of the comic. It seems kind of unprofessional to have that on a portfolio website, and I think it might even be confusing to people who are unfamiliar with tapastic. 
I know it's a long shot, but is there a way to edit the embed code so it will only show my comic and not the series icon, series  name, or my username? Alternatively, does anyone know a good way of putting scrolling comics on a Weebly site? Weebly keeps resizing my images, and/or making them weirdly pixelated.

376,Is your drawing software supposed to do this?,Answered,[],"EDIT I got a lot of helpful tips! My drawings are looking much better now, thanks guys! I'd say my question has been answered!
I recently had to switch to medibang because a) I needed a software that supports large file sizes and b) medibang not any other software was chosen because I don't have the money or computer
I just noticed that Medibang really defines the pixels, even though I'm working with print size at 350 dpi, which is average-ish sufficient. But even whenever I'm not zoomed in past 100% I can see little right angles all over my lines. On my old app, no matter how much I zoomed in everything would still look smooth and natural. Which one is the one that is supposed to happen in more professional softwares like Photoshop? I already tried increasing resolution but it didn't do anything, 
EDIT okay so I found out about this anti aliasing thing, but on the iPad it seems like only the eraser and selection drawing too has it and not the general picture. I can't smooth down any lines I guess.l. I guess at this point there really isn't anything that can be done :/ 
Here is one of my drawings at 100% on Medibang (sorry for the crappy rough draft) 
This is the drawing zoomed in 
And this is another drawing zoomed in in my old software (the one that can't do large files e.g. Printing size) and although you see pixels, they are no where near as rough as medibang.  
Thanks for the help!","[""I'm not familiar with mediabang, but if there's an anti-aliasing option, you should turn it on to reduce the super-defined pixel effect.

OP may not even be using this for print (OP will have to clarify that themselves).

Seeing as how most of us aren't being paid to create our work, none of us should feel obligated to pay into a crazy expensive program if we aren't able to/don't want to. While I cringe just as much as the thought of drawing on an iPad, I've seen some pretty awesome stuff drawn on them, so don't dismiss them outright just because they're iPads and not Cintiqs or light boards.\n\n@OP I don't know what tools that Medibang offers, but maybe check to see wha type of brush you're using?

What size can we post on here? I mean ""size"" by the dimensions of panels.
Is there a limit on length?

The size-limit on images here on Tapastic are 940 pixels by 4000 pixels. A single image has to be 2MB or less. \n2.) You can post 40 files in total per episode - that is, 40 images. The general advice seems to be to keep your episodes from being TOO long, as people want to comment, and if they have to scroll too long to get to the comment-field, they might lose interest and stop reading. \n3.) I don't use LINE Webtoon at all, but I'm told that Tapastic is friendlier and more welcoming! : ) Competition is fiercer on Webtoon, I believe, which leads to a harsher atmosphere in the comment-field."", 'Thanks for the informative response, AnnaLandin!

413,ToS: Please define “Excessive Length?”,Answered,[],"So while browsing the forums, I came across a thread that posted a particular section of Tap's ToS.  While the topic was about their stance on porn and NSFW material, something else from the passage caught my eye.
Tapas reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. Tapas may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.
Does anyone know what they mean by ""excessive length?""  Are they speaking of a single episode in the sense you probably should not include 100 pages in one episode?  Or are they speaking of the entire comic and if you reach too many episodes you're in trouble?  I find this to be a very concerning issue since it's in a clause that says Tap can delete the comic or your entire account without notice.","['I\'m not Staff, so I don\'t know for certain, but I think this ""excessive length"" thing is about the length of individual episodes. There are comics on here with an episode-count in the high hundreds, and they haven\'t been getting in trouble. \nThere\'s a file-limit of 40 files per episode, but you can do a lot within that constraint to make you episode longer to scroll through. Perhaps this is to prevent individual episodes from taking too long to load? \n... I\'ll be honest, that\'s one part of the ToS I haven\'t paid attention to before. o.O', '@AnnaLandin Yeah, for individual episodes I could understand that stipulation.  Not only for load times, but also for readers because no one really wants to scroll endlessly to reach the comment section of an episode.\nYet, the vague terminology worries me.  I know a few people whose intended comic length will be in the high hundreds for episode count at the very least by the time they finish.  I worry someday that vague terminology may be abused and used to delete those comics to create server space or something like that (all on the grounds they\'re an ""excessive length."")\nMy friend has tweeted at Tap directly on Twitter though about this, so we\'ll see if there\'s more clarification about it tomorrow.\nThank you for your input though~!', ""That language was written prior to certain limitations added after (i.e. pixel length per image used to be 8,000px and is now 4,000px, image compression operated differently, episode image limits were higher). \nWe've never removed an episode for excessive length, and don't foresee any need to based on the aforementioned changes added. \nWe wouldn't delete existing episodes to create server space, we'd just upgrade our servers.\nUnder my editorial supervision, we've only had to remove episodes based on stolen content, spam, pornography, and one instance of hate speech. For stolen content and spam and hate speech, we delete the series outright and remove the user account. For pornography, we remove the episodes but allow the creator to reach out to their subscribers to let them know where they can find more of their work. \nHope that clears things up!"", '\n\nAnnaLandin:\nI\'m not Staff, so I don\'t know for certain, but I think this ""excessive length"" thing is about the length of individual episodes.

I've seen people get around this by keeping the main series titled episodes, and a second series titled chapters."", 'Thanks ^^But that means I have to re-upload all the pages from a chapter under the 1st file and lose all the likes and comments on them right? QQ', 'Yes, currently there is no way to merge your pages without losing your comments and all that stuff associated with the page (not sure about the overall view count for the series though)', ""aw figures >< that sucks. Oh well... maybe in the future. I guess I'll leave it like this for now. Thanks for answering guys! <3"", 'Unfortunately yes... When I started out I whacked all 32 into one episode, not knowing how episodes worked haha. As I said, the workaround is to make a new series and just let people know they can find their preferred format there.']",4/19/2016 7:09
420,Scheduling for comics still bugged? “Episode 0”,Answered,[],"Hi- sorry if this has been posted somewhere but for the last two week's I have had this same problem- and I couldn't be bothered to sift through every thread looking for an answer lol.
I fill out the upload form and it plainly says episode 100 or 101...whatever it is, and then when I hit schedule it says that it's ""Episode 0"" and shenanigans happen.
Heres a screenshot. Anyone else having this issue or know if it's being fixed?","[""Oh gotcha! I think just a UI side bug. You can just ignore the number. When the scheduled episode is published, the number will be set by correct number.  I'll fix the bug anyway! \nThank you!"", ""Cheers I really appreciate the fix on that. Even if it's just a random number being wrong- it stresses me out because it makes me think it's doing things wrong and shows stuff in the wrong order, and I'm kind've a freak about my work lol. Thanks hope it will be fixed. ^W^""]",4/15/2016 17:17
421,Landscape pages/double-page spreads on Tapastic,Answered,[],"So, I have a landscape/double-page spread page on my comic, but if I make it 940 pixels wide, it'll be way to small and the quality of the image will be decreased. Is there a way to make an exception with this?","[""No, I'm afraid not. 940 pixels is the absolute limit. Tapastic isn't really designed to handle double-page spreads, so you'll either have to post it as two separate pages (i.e: cut it in two in the middle), redraw it to fit a more vertical format, or host it elsewhere. :T"", 'I have a double-page spread at the end of Time Gate: Reaper. Though it seemed like a possible idea to reformat it for Tapastic, I preferred having it as a double spread for the sake of printing (which Time Gate will be intended for in the future), so I said ""fuck it"" and just made it 940 pixels wide. Didn\'t really bother anyone despite it being smaller.', ""That works, as long as there isn't a lot of text to be read - resizing what's originally meant to be a double-page spread in print into 940px can result in tiny, tiny text. But you'd just have to adapt that to work on Tapastic, if that's what you end up doing! \nThere's usually a solution to every problem, even if it isn't perfect."", ""AnnaLandin:That works, as long as there isn't a lot of text to be read - resizing what's originally meant to be a double-page spread in print into 940px can result in tiny, tiny text. But you'd just have to adapt that to work on Tapastic, if that's what you end up doing!\nWell, I think it varies depending on what the spread is. So far the only spreads I have scheduled to draw are ones that are large action/reveal scenes, so they don't have a lot of text (I don't like using too much text in spreads because spreads should be used to portray a dynamic scene - text bubbles would just crowd it up; but sometimes it's what needs to be done, in which case, increasing text box/bubble size is easier than redrawing an entire spread set).""]",4/17/2016 11:15
422,The “Add Translation” Feature,Answered,[],"Before I made a comic on Tapastic, I saw other comics with ""Translation,"" and I saw that language was the original file (Especially Spanish). I had a comic that was originally in my native language, and I translated into English.
But when I clicked ""Add Translation"" from my first episode, I was really disappointed when I saw this. I said, ""Why only these languages? Can't they just make a list of all languages like Google would?"" I was very disappointed that time.","['\n\nkeac:\nI said, ""Why only these languages? Can\'t they just make a list of all languages like Google would?"" I was very disappointed that time.\nProbably because Google has a much higher global demographic than Tapastic. I can only assume the languages they chose were the languages that belonged to their major readerships and their main languages. I don\'t know about you, but I highly doubt there are a lot of Tapastic\'ers looking for comics in ""Nyanja"" or ""Azerbaijani"". \nPlus, for once, Google is a bad example to use considering Google is just . . . horrible at translating. If you\'re using Google to translate your comics, they aren\'t going to read very well, and that\'s why it\'s such a big reason so many artists/creators choose to find people who actually speak/read/write the language than use Google, just to ensure an accurate translation that came from someone who actually knows the language.', 'I know that Google Translate is horrible at translating.I meant that Google has a lot of languages and I hope Tapastic would have a selection of many languages aside from major ones.\'Cause I have an original copy of my comic in a native language and the other one which translates to English. That native language isn\'t included in the selection of ""Add Translation"" or ""Original File.""', ""Inkblazers did have more language options, from Italian to Russian. I believe Tagalog and Malay (which surprised me) were included too. I don't think it would be that big of a hurdle for Tapastic to add to the list. Besides, the translation is already in the comic pages, written by the creator."", 'My comic was originally Tagalog. I had no choice but to just put it in English, but at the same time I got disappointed.', 'Wow, I never noticed this. I was hoping to translate my comic to Italian eventually, so this is kind of disappointing.', 'I agree that languages like Italian, Swedish, Finnish, and Dutch should be added, but that\'s only because those are major languages that happened to be missed on that list. \nThe only thing I\'m pointing out is that those more minor languages (like the ones I\'ve mentioned already), would probably end up not being used most of the time (and don\'t forget that the more languages you want to translate to, the more work you have to do to reformat your comics, and even if you ""demand"" for these languages to be added, you yourself may not end up using them in the future to begin with.)', ""I wish too they would add more languages, I can't upload my native one either :<"", ""I'm not sure if this is true or not, but could it be because they have to translate the entire site for each of these languages for it to be available? Or is that not an option?"", ""@KaiLynx I don't think so? I've tried to bring a few Korean readers over, and they were super confused because they didn't understand English. XD Yet Korean is one of the available options. So I don't think the site has to be available in that language in order to have that language available as a translation option for individual comics."", ""The site will remain english, however the translate can be only for the comics. It's still an option to keep it both english"", 'I don\'t think that changing the language of the site is that important: I once sent a friend a link for my comic, and just told her to click on the yellow button.\nThat said, since there is no option to search comics by language, it could be nice to let each author choose the language rather than selecting one. Imagine, for instance, that I want to translate my comic into Italian, which isn\'t in the list. I could just write ""ITALIAN"" when selecting the language, and it\'d appear that way.\nBtw, searching comics by language available would be a nice thing to add too. I wouldn\'t mind catching up with French, which I\'m starting to get worse at, by reading webcomics..', ""So you would say that it's definitely better to upload two comics with a different language each?"", 'I\'m italian and I draw a comic about baseball (CasaBase1). My main language is obviously italian, but I translated to english in order to join Tapastic, that I think is a wonderful, gorgeous comic portal!All functions I found on Tapastic were great! When in the beginning I found the Add translation button I was amazed! I said to myself: ""Great job! They care about non-english artists and readers! This is THE portal for me!"".Then I realized that only a few languages were allowed. Italian was not one of those. I wonder why ... I can program a site so I know exactly that is only a matter of only an additional field in the database, for each episode, to assign it a ""IT"" or a ""UK"" or any other couple of characters, and to filter them in the viewing portal. Simply as that.Tapastic have not to manage or to take responsibility about translation quality. Artists only, will be held responsible. So?\nOK, I can stand with this. I\'ll publish only in english, cutting away the possible italian readers.\nNow I read that Translations are being cutted away. Suggestions: Create a new series for each language. Not a lot of work more, but why? I think Tapastic is ruining the system, here, instead of increasing functions, they are cutting them away.\nWhat do you think about it?', 'As I said somewhere else:\nTapastic sure has a table, in his database, about the series, and a table about episodes.What you need to do is simply add a field to the database episodes, named language, where a two-characters code will identify in which language that episode is written: Example ""UK"" stands for english, ""IT"" stands for italian.Probably you can add a field named main-language to the table series, so the artist can decide which language is shown at first when someone go to his/her series without specifying a language. When searching a series, you can let the reader to select a language from a list of available ones (simply a filter on the database), so the results will return only series that has at least one episode in that language.With this additional field, is also possible to add multiple languages to the same series, with almost no weight added to the database.\nAnd when I read a comic in english, I can swap to another language by selecting from the list as it was before, with the ""language"" button.', ""I'm assuming it's because they don't simply let you publish comics in another language - the whole site's language changes?I do believe they should let us so it your way."", 'I believe the entire reason they cut it away, and this is in no way confirmed by staff, just my own guess, but I think it is because the ""add translation"" function meant that two files needed to be added for each series instead of one. This probably put a strain on the servers due to now each series was twice as big for the same number of subscribers/readers. If that is the case, it makes sense why they took it away.\nHowever, I agree with all of you on this thread that this makes me pretty mad as it is one of the reasons I used Tapastic so much and was one of the main functionalities that drew me to the site. Now it is gone and I am not sure what the benefit will be to me to split my subscribers between English speaking and Spanish speaking in two series when it is really one.', '@dglisson : If you post two separate series, one for each language, you post two files per episode, on the server.Same exactly space if you post two images, one per language, under a language management site, like I suggested.Same exactly space if you post the two different language images, on the same episode.The server space cannot be an issue.\nMoreover, a big, big slice of the market (comic readers) are coming from other languages. I can say spanish, french, korean, italian, japanize and chinese, are passionate comic readers and probably the overwhelm the english reader, in number ... why to cut there potential customers with such a decision?', 'Well, I found this by one of the mods in a forum post.\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to keep translations during the server migration.\nWe encourage creators to create a separate series and tag them accordingly. We will be assembling various collections that gather certain language comics together to make them easier to find.\n\nI\'m not so sure  as to what they mean by ""certain languages"" but okay.Is it only going to be certain languages or certain comics like the popular ones in whichever language? \nI am a little miffed about the translation option being taken away as well, not only that it wasn\'t that big of an announcement from what I remember, it was just posted in a forum somewhere and I think it was only to reply to a question regarding the issue. I spent over 10 minutes trying to find out what the hell had happened. >_> \nOne of the things that worried me and my translator was confusion, so after I made a series for the Portuguese version, I also made a click the banner if you need English/Portuguese in both languages and linked them together in case if people clicked on the wrong one.', ""It's a very good idea, using the banner to change the language. It can be a solution for me too, but I wonder if there's people managing comics with more than 2 languages...  ouch >.<\nDoing separate comics for each, it will be good if Tapastic offer a filter or categories of different languages, being easier to find comics in certain languages.""]",6/7/2015 7:21
