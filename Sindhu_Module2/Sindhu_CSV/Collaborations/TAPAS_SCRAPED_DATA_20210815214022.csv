The entire time I have been on the forums, there hasn't been a thread I have seen where the OP is actively searching and the process takes over a month but then they finally find someone. A lot more common is people bumping threads that are 20, 25 days old, after the OP has most likely stopped searching, and then that thread floats around for a while as users continually bump it. It just makes it a little more difficult to figure out what collaboration threads are actually active, in my opinion.""]",6/6/2020 4:57,https://forums.tapas.io/t/before-submitting-your-collaboration-request/41606

2,"Isekai Team Project (Unpaid, Collab)",Collaborations,[],"Hello there, I noticed a part of the forum talking about isekai stories and tropes that they disliked about them. I feel inspired to attempt to make one that is not another cliche. I will need a little help with that though. 
A writer will be needed to exchange ideas with (I myself will be a writer as well).
An artist or two to draw the webcomic (you help with plot too).
I can‚Äôt afford to pay you for your time, but whatever money is made by this project will be split evenly. This is a collaboration and a schedule can be discussed among the group.
Below is a list of things the story must have to defy the tropes and the other list will be ones that will be excluded.
Must Include
Exploration/adventure (visit many new places)
Character Development
Give information about character before Isekai
MC is unprepared for the world.
Magic system.
Fantasy setting for everyday life (no technology).
New animals and plants.
Stereotypes
Defeating a demon lord.
Harem.
Being born into a wealthy family/nobility.
Ridiculous title (ones that basically say the whole plot).
Overpowered character.
Overpowered character who wants a peaceful life.
Knowing everything about the world or being fully capable of handling it.
Technology.
Normal animals/creatures/plants (bears, boars, etc)

My position:head, writer, guionist and characters creator
Searching for:-1 storyboarder-Some lineart artist-Some paintors-1 background artist
Hi there! I've been thinking about a story for a few years. It is about a family that seems human, they try to act like a normal and ordinary family but in truth they are demons. The father of the family is a demon with problems with alcohol and work, the mother is a housewife obsessed with being the president of the neighborhood mothers association. The eldest daughter is the most popular girl in her high school and is terrified that they will find out that she is a demon. The middle son is afraid to scare the girl he likes and the little girl loves to burn things. It is a story of comedy, adventure and family togetherness. It deals with the day to day of the family and their adventures so that people do not discover that they are demons. The style that I would like is cartoon. Something like Satina(the pic :3)Plsss If you are interested tell me here at the comments and add me to discord. I'm Strawberry#7970IMPORTANT:I DON'T PAY, I'M 16 AND I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY, BUT IF IT BECAMES FAMOUS WE CAN WIN MONEY. I'm not a professional but I will try to do my best :3

5,Join my creative group,Collaborations,[],"Hello! In short, I am trying to find people who are like me. I am in search of people who use art to truly express their feelings & perspective. I want YOU. Whatever storytelling you do, whether it be visual art, writing, music, show up and show out!!! .	HOWEVER, If You:.-Aren‚Äôt serious about your art-Don‚Äôt explore art outside the mainstream-Are a right winger.	You probably aren‚Äôt one of the people I‚Äôm looking for. I want people open to art that is experimental or abstract, art that pushes its medium, art that ignores the boundaries of genre or that portrays something deeper. I don‚Äôt want people who scoff at things they don‚Äôt understand..	If you decide to DM me, and you are really one of the people I‚Äôm looking for, I will consider you a Shut-in Creative.
YOU WILL GIVE:
-Samples of your art / a place where your art can be viewed-Some information about yourself to help me get to know you
YOU WILL RECIEVE:
-Feedback from other Shut-in Creatives-Chance to collaborate with other Shut-in Creatives-Full promotion via social media
.	My interests / ideas about art.	I am most interested in art that explores pain and trauma. This doesn‚Äôt mean that I dislike positive art. I love any art that I believe expresses or represents the truth of a feeling. The only art that I dislike is art that goes against expression. I don‚Äôt like conformity, I don‚Äôt like dishonesty, and I don‚Äôt like generic stories..	Some examples of art that I love:
Death Grips   -   His & Her Circumstances   -   Chainsaw Man   -   The Caretaker   -   ENA   -   Lil Nas X   -   Baphomet Kun   -   Squimpus McGrimpus   -   godweaver   -   Mitski   -   ezekiel singles ‚Äò18-‚Äô20   -   FLCL   -   Evangelion   -   Satoshi Kon   -   sewerslvt   -   George Miller
BOTTOM LINE!
I want artists who are skilled and passionate, who pour their souls into their work. Artists who can let their skill speak for their ideas, and who don‚Äôt want to be held back by convention or conformity. Contact me and I will get to know you, then we‚Äôll find out if you‚Äôre one of the people I‚Äôm searching for. Hit me up if you‚Äôre interested.

When the lively and hopeful Tara finds herself stranded in a mind-bending alien realm, she must conquer its unknown dangers to survive - but is survival worth giving up her happiness for?
This is a 6-page short comic that uses the 9-panel grid to trap the main character in small, confined panels that represent the unhappy life she confined herself to out of fear. she then breaks away from this grid in a climactic splash page to show her growth. in total, there are 42 panels, but there are lots of opportunities to recycle art that I'll be more than happy if you took advantage of.
So what I'm looking for is thumbnailing, line art, lettering, character design (there's only one character) background design, and background art. the setting is, as described above, ""a mind-bending alien realm"", so the backgrounds are fairly important for selling that. I have a fairly good idea of the elements this realm will be comprised of, so you just need to bring it to life whichever way you choose. since the panels will be mostly small, the background won't show up in full more than once or twice, so you don't gotta worry about having to draw it too many times.
If you only wanna do one part of the job in isolation, like just doing the thumbnailing, that's cool! we can find other people to do the other things and split the job whichever way you're most comfortable with. and I can take care of the promotion!If you want, I can also draw a storyboard for you to use as a guideline, although I firmly believe any ideas you'll come up with will be much better than mine, haha.
you can read the script here! even if you don't wanna draw it, I'd still love to know your opinion. (note this script doesn't include the character descriptions. that's in another doc)

13,Writer seeking for a collaboration for a webcomic (Unpaid),Collaborations,[],"Hello everyone,
I'm a 25 years old writer who has had a year experience of serialization for one book. I even had the chance to participate in events like ""le salon du livre"" in paris. I have many stories I wrote and I'm writing right now. My dream is to write sotries for comics and animations. I'm looking for an artist to work with and create webtoons together. No time constraint or anything.
Bellow some resumes of the stories i'm working on.
Soichiro, the son of the Titans (The story for this one is finished and i'm working on the sequel) : The time of the magic,  ninjas and the sacred samurais is an era of misfortunes and wars for the men. In spite of the treaty of alliance between these three brotherhoods, the battles continued and raged. These three respectful entities are mirrored to dictate the world and to eliminate God defenders, the most powerful of the resistances. The small innocent villages, being afraid of being mixed with the battles, kept a close watch on every birth. So, as soon as a cursed baby was born (by distinguishing features), his parents were forced to flood him. It is so, as in one of these fragile small villages, a young woman was about to give birth to a boy, who could return the wiser world ... . In this world of battles and relentless fights, we follow the evolution of a young hero whose fate seems all mapped out. 
Guardians of spirits : A story that mixes everyday student life and fantasy with a touch of mysticism, for a rather unique whole.Kiri, an ordinary young student with a mixed race family, rather average in his school results, finds himself summoned one day to a new teacher's office for a discussion at the end of which a succession of events upsetting his daily life will appear one after the other.
Darkness : We follow the adventures of a young demon belonging to the royalty of his world and the different situations he will be confronted with in contrast to the human world. What is really a demon, what behaviour is expected of them. Will the protagonist be able to show humanity while keeping his integrity ?  
The quest for love : The story begins in a ballroom, where a big party was taking place. It was the evening of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Sakazaki. In a burst of discussion, he decides to relate his life and the love affairs that led to his meeting his wife and the life of the couple up to this event.
If you're interested you can show me your art in the comments and we will move the the discussion on a discord server and on a MangaFY.com account. The  plan for the series are parution on the Webtoon app and other similar platforms. As i said before there is no pressure or schedhule since it's an Unpaid work, i'm working on stories on the side since i have another job so i think it's safe to assume my future collaborator will be in a similar situation.

To make a long story short I started this webtoon in January as a passion project and it morphed into a big part of my life. I was on a solid trajectory for season 2 which was planned to start on Sep 6th of this year. Unfortunately, my illustrator had an untimely family matter to see too that has kicked her off the project. 
I've attached some panels and the cover to show the kind of art style we were using (All art styles are good in my book and I don't mind adjusting either) 
You can email me @ Triageforlovegd@gmail.com or just reply here in the forum with your email for me to connect and take a look at your work. I've also attached a link to the webtoon itself and the IG page.

They can be playing an extra-curricular activity sport, studying in the library, having lunch in the cafeteria, chatting with friends before class, or anything school-related. They can even be the teacher(s) themselves!

The goal is for a long term project and something me, the fans, and the artist can be proud of. Plans are to publish on Tapas and Webtoon. Now, I worked with a webtoon artist before and they charged me a rate of 20 per panel (which is 80 per page), but I'm willing to adjust this reasonably. Hell, if the artist of Solo Leveling were to show up, I'd be all about that haha.
Paid: Yep. [Paid per page though.]Budget: $1,000 a month for starts, but demand will increase as the fans settle in or people experience ATS for the first time through the webtoon: enabling the platform's revenue opportunities. [although I'm going to live with the expectation of paying out of pocket and nothing else, as well as keeping things realistic.] 
[if you're looking to get paid per episode, let me know asap and we can talk about it. If we're going to be working on this thing for years, I'd like that detail up and out of the way haha]
 I can only work with someone who knows how to make a good webtoon. I've already tried working with a n00b before and it was a complete disaster. I can't afford to be kind. Chill, yes. But everyone's responsible for their own creative careers.
Contact:twitter, reddit (syr456), or here is fine. I will invite the selectee to our discord server later. I know through dm's, I can only reply to those that we're interested in. While most artists simply leave their portfolio and bounce, I won't reply if the style isn't what we're looking for nor if the artist has no actual webtoon experience. Portfolios as usual, as they speak for you. [existing webtoons work too if the style is relevant.]
Schedule: ideally weekly or bi-weekly; however I've been in this game long enough to know that sometimes that shit isn't possible. However, I'm aiming for being productive. Just without burning out the artist: quality is important for a strong impression and to keep people coming back every week.  
Style:  This is non-negotiable. I've got the fan base, feverishly looking forward to ATS's webtoon. An experienced webtoon artist knows he's got to impress. Anime and manhwa art style only. High quality kind that is. Think about it. What brings you back to a Korean manhwa or doujin. 
Note: You must be fine with NSFW (though the nsfw bits will not be posted on Webtoon due to their TOS.) You don't have to worry about coming up with character designs. As an established series, we've got some to work with (though the art for some are still WIP from the main artist who does my book covers and characters.)
Note 2: we're directly adapting the book to manhwa/webtoon. While I have two old examples you can look at (which I challenge you to beat), I will be giving you the ebook. It's written in a way that is easy to convert. 
We of course have to take it one episode at a time haha. Let me know your max pages per week that you can do without losing quality or burning out. (Or max pages per bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) Although if you're not motivated and don't see yourself as being a part of the ATS brand in the future, it's probably best not to apply. Creative artists tend to quit on their own when they're not serious about something.

The story takes place on a post apocalyptic where the main characters are trying to find a way to return to Earth. However, as they go around to collect parts for a spaceship, they slowly discovered more about the horrors within the red planet as well as their true origins.
The current art team consists of 3 people: one main artist who is responsible for character designs, background and drawing the first and final webtoon draft; a secondary artist who speicalises in mecha and creature designs who will add details to the first draft and help with background design; me, the writer, who is responsible for the script, general designs and organisation (I am also helping with weapon designs with my limited engineering CAD skills). Thus, if you are interested in helping with or comfortable with:- Background design - Mecha/object design (assissting the mecha artist, who then can spend more time on creature designs. You can also help me with designing the tools/weapons)- Drafting- 3D modelling- Photoshoping- Character design (to assist the main artist with some side/minor character designs)- Drawing in general (but you need to arrange work distribution with the current artists)
Keep in mind, althought this may seem like a very sci-fi focused plot, but it is designed to be more of a dark fantasy. The sci-fi elements will be covered by me and the current mecha artist (but if you are a sci-fi/mecha guy, be my guest!), so you do not need to be drawing sci-fi/mecha if you don't want!
So if you are interested in helping out and practice your skills, please contact WHO#8894 on discord (prefered) or ladoggymaus@gmail.com. It will be great if you can provide us some examples of your art when you sign up, so we can evaulate your role in the project quickly.

I'm a webtoons canvas artist interested in collaborating with a writer for a concise series. I'm shooting for 4 - 10 chapters maximum. Something that's punchy and doesn't drag on for too long. I'm looking for a writer that's more on the mature side (around 30 or up) and is comfortable with sci-fi or contemporary writing; something like an episode of love, death, and robots would be cool.
Here is my series as for my credentials:

The Raven and The Skull
A girl, known by the common folk as the raven, wanders around the world in a quest for revenge. The only tools at her disposal are the weapons her arms can wield and the aid of her unlikely companion.

As for benefits, I'm not thinking about making a penny with this, but it could look excellent in my portfolio as an artist, and I'm pretty sure it would do so for the writer.

I'm 24 years old and currently writing various stories in genres like BL, fantasy, science fiction, horror, and comedy. I've long wanted to create a comic book and while I have the skills to both write and illustrate, making a comic by myself simply isn't realistic. While I have the skills for it, in practice, it would take me forever actually to put anything out. 
I'm wondering if any of you would like to work with me potentially. 
We would create original comics, and I would head our group as lead author and art director. I would need at least three, maybe four people.

Two illustrators. One capable of drawing characters and another capable of drawing scenery and things of that nature. 
An Inker to handle color throughout pages. 
Someone to handle typography
Maybe another author 

I'm open to more people, but I'd need at least these positions to be full. As I said, I would be the lead author, so I'd write the story and dialog for our comic. As a team, we would decide on what kind of story we want to tell, but from there, I would lead us through construction. 
Our project wouldn't seek profit. Our work would be purely for the sake of creating something we all can be happy with. And of course, anyone who wants to post the comic or add it to their portfolio would be more than welcome to.

Remember, this is a thread for networking! Be sure to tag and reply to others in the thread if they have spots for cross-promoting, and make sure to offer it as well on your own comic.

I've started/finished there in February/June '21 and it has over 16k comments for 50 chapters https://www.wattpad.com/story/260281383?utm_source=android&utm_medium=link&utm_content=share_reading&wp_page=reading&wp_uname=glasssvial2121&wp_originator=8Owh3uDBqsfdgpCmktuuCWOU6RTZR%2BdOdqG%2FZN7OJSckdJPcubrqnjwZ6AIxoMGYY4LfA976l60A%2F7WTzNDqoUJY4cFDPuWwKmmatvnbTvOFdaAT8cGYe0A2UVU0zJpT2 ), it's currently edited by an editor. I've had this idea of turning it into a comic. The story is loved by most that read it and I know precisely which scenes are most popular with the readers. 
I'm looking for someone to collaborate with, someone that I can make this a successful comic with together. I have ideas that I want to use but since this will be a collab, we can discuss things and artists probably know certain things better than I do. It's a long story so there should be some things cut out but it'll still be a long process, which means I need someone committed and reliable in pushing through till the end. 
If you're interested, you can send me an email at schildpadleeuw@gmail.com or send me a message so we can discuss things. 
I need someone over 18 (!) that isn't afraid to make mature content and BL. Don't message me if you are below 18. I'm looking for a mature slightly realistic vibe. Not childish and cute.
My goal is to put our comic love baby on Patreon by two creators (me 35% and you 65%). I think we can make this a success but you will need to put some time into it first. This book has been published twice on Wattpad and twice it gained over 600.000 views within a few months, staying high in the boyxboy/bxb/BL charts for months. (Okay, enough bragging hahaha).
Blurb story: An 18-year-old moved from the juvenile center to an adult prison facility and needs to take measures in his own hands to keep himself safe. He offers his new cellmate a deal...

I just saw this post and I thought of some things that may help you.\nFirst, you linked a manga in page/printed format, are you searching for someone who will draw your story in pages or in scroll down phone format. I think it may help both you and the artist since both have different rates, printing page being always more expensive.\nSecond, how frecuently do you wish to uploade. Most comics upload 1 per week, but that would probably be really expensive since that would became your artist full time job.\nIn my opinion, you should pay your artist before you start publishing since this is your dream project and you should be the one taking the risk. I know this wasnt your intention, but as an artist sometimes the ""sharing benefits"" feels like being asked for free art. Also, I understand comics are incredibly expensive, so my recomendation for funding it would be opening a patreon/kickstarted beforehand where you ask your readers for help in case they want to help you. Maybe in exchange you can give an extra chapter idk.\nI noticed that the art you are looking for is extremely beautiful, which probably belongs to a trained person. I would recomend searching on Artstation or twitting your job offers using the hastag comic works.\nGood luck in your search and project!', ""I have found my person  I have agreed with paying upfront and owning the commercials.

47,Writer looking for Artist [PAID] WEBTOON [CLOSED],Collaborations,[],"Hello everyone!
I am looking for an artist who genuinely cares about the work they do. Someone who is caring, responsible, enthusiastic, and driven by a vision. LONG-TERM; PAID. 
Project Status
I've written the entire script, which still requires some editing/proofreading but the main story is there.
Genre: Drama, Fantasy, Historical, Romance
Inspired by/similar to: Light and Shadow; Lucia; Like Wind on a Dry Branch; Under the Oak Tree (The art style I had in mind would also be similar to these webtoons.)
Synopsis:
After 6 years away at a secluded boarding school, Ginevra is finally recalled to her family estate for her grandmother‚Äôs funeral where her father tells her that she must accept an offer for her hand in marriage to Taren, the Duke of Maldoni and the heir of the power-lusty dukedom in the north, in order to secure her family‚Äôs future and safety. Having lost half her family in an accident 6 years prior, Ginevra accepts, and ends up in the claws of a manipulative, cold, and beautiful stranger ‚Äì her husband. As she starts her life at the estate, hidden intentions, generational curses, and buried secrets from her own past begin to resurface, and Ginevra must learn how to tell perceptions from the truth, enemies from foes, her mind from her heart, while resisting Taren‚Äôs lethal charm, to stay alive.
About Me!:
I have experience as a published writer and film-maker. I've received awards for some of my short stories and the films I've co-directed have been featured at a couple of film festivals. I perpetually feel as if I have these worlds, stories, and characters in me which I feel compelled to share. I am a romantic at heart. I love stories which have strong and encouraging messages which inspire readers/viewers, stories which bring out the light in others.
Link to my general film website: https://www.tkebuchavaproductions.com/35
Compensation: This is a story that I just really want to tell. I want to work with someone talented, responsible, and enthusiastic, who also shares my vision. Message me if interested and let's negotiate. 
Please message me if you are interested in collaborating (or know someone who may be a good fit), and I can send an excerpt of the script

50,Writer looking for an Artist for a Webtoon Project (closed),Collaborations,[],"Introduction: Hello I'm part-time writer (hobby), but I have been writing stories since I was in elementary school on the wattpad app. I am really passionate about writing that I finally decided that it is time to turn it into a webtoon and show it to everyone. Project Details / Pitch / Sample : I have the documents for the project details, so if you're interested please comment down and provide your contact info as well! The genre is : Action,Fantasy and Comedy It will be in a scroll-down format and colored.It has tons of magic-related scenes and fight scenes - so if you have experience then that would be great!
Paid or non-paid? Collaboration? Partnership?It will be a partnership, so I am looking for an artist who is enthusiastic about the project. I am willing to pay PER CHAPTER although it will be small amount of money since I am still a college student. I will be willing to split the revenue (if there will be), since I do have some people looking forward on the project .
Skills you are looking for / what you are looking forI am looking for an artist who has an anime/manhwa art-style. As for the project, it will be a team webtoon project - however the artist I am looking for will be doing the character and main arts. Required Software (Optional)I actually don't have a required software, I am fine with anything as long as it can provide you with the effects. If it doesn't, I do have a Clip Studio account that I can lend you to help you as well 
Schedule/scale (Deadlines, the length of the work, etc)The length of the project will be a little bit long, since it is still on-going.  I am not very strict of getting suggestions or corrections with the script - so feel free to tell me! As for the deadlines, I do like to be productive because if I don't I won't be able to get anything done at all - so for the webtoon posting, I actually prefer if we post every week. BUT - we will be working on five or more episodes done before posting the first episode in that way we can get a week off to work on the future episodes. ( I don't know if that makes sense). Let me know if it still doesn't work for you. Further information will be provided if you're really interested, you can also send me a dm on my instagram!

I'm looking to do 1-3 posts a month. I know this is probably something anyone else can do on their own however I just think it'd be nice to work with others. 
What I'm willing to do is work with artists to create random characters to show off their art. Making a small bio and interesting facts about the character. If the artist has a main idea for a character I'm willing to help them further develop the character. Humanoid, android, creature etc. 
I don't know much about art but if your willing to listen to some things that a outsider like me can see I would be happy to point out things I can think of to help. 
Genres: I don't believe I have limits lol LGBT, Horror, Incest etc. I've seen a whole lot of different genres including BDSM so no fears. Just give me the genres you prefer and I can try spouting out some ideas or help with your own idea. 
FYI this isn't only restricted to working on posting with me. If you generally could use help with character ideas for your own series or art portfolio etc. Anything I'd be willing to take a look and give ideas.

Caden has been in love with his childhood friend, Daniel for years. But their relationship has been been a bit rocky due to certain events that occurred 7 years ago. As he recalls the unexpected events from the past, will he be able to accept this...






So, here's my idea for the cover: I'm picturing a love triangle sort of portrait. The girl is standing in the middle of the two male leads. Daniel and the girl are standing closer to each other, almost in an embrace while she leans on him. Meanwhile, Caden is standing not too far behind her. I'd like Caden and Daniel's gazes locked on each other while Caden is holding on to Daniel's free hand. (I can give more details on their physical appearances as well later on)
For the thumbnail: Three words: sexy but classy. Lol, just two bodies entangled in bed with messy sheets around...

I am looking for a person who can help me edit chapters before they are officially released. This includes grammatical issues and plot issues (for example if you see an area that I could add extra detail to). 
I know this seems like a lot of work and to not be paid seems like a no-go, but I will ensure a couple of things. 1. I will ensure you that I will work my hardest to keep your work at a minimum (I currently re-read my chapters 5+ times). 2. If I ever do earn money from this work, we can discuss a money incentive deal then. 3. I know this isn't a lot, but if I gain more fame (which I steadily am), I will also shout you out. 
What I would like to know about you: 
1: Your country of origin/primary language. 2: Your age.3: If you have any previous experience editing novels/writing them.4: If you have written/edited novels before, please give a link to them.5: Can you edit one Chapter per week? 
How to contact me? Well, you can respond to this forum and answer the questions. I am also available on Instagram (check out my bio on tapas for the link to it). I can also communicate through discord: ChickenChief#1705 
Any of these outlets work for me, I am very flexible so just let me know. 
-Sincerely, ChickenChief

63,Anyone want to do an Art Collab like art train? Details inside!,Collaborations,[],"Hey all!
Would anyone want to participate in doing an comic train? I'm not sure thats the right term for what I'm talking about but this is how it works:
1) Each artist has 3 panels template. We all use the same font and size. 2) We all take turns telling the story in order. For example I start the first 3 panels, whoever is next is their turn to do the next 3 panels, then the 3rd artist does 3 panels, and it goes on till it goes back to my turn. 
Let me know if any are interested! I'm not sure if we can post the comic in the forums or if we should make it a private comic till we finish it. 
Let me know peeps!
The template we all use:
520p9q.png1530x455 2.62 KB

The font and size: ""Digital Strip"" Size 12

These 3 panels are  what we are starting the comic train with if you're interested:

We are already working on a story with a unique plot.
THE PLOT:Set in medieval times a robot girl, Eva, was built to take care of an elderly man. That very man told Eva to run away from the mansion they resided in and choose her own life. She did just that and ran into a vampire named Micaela.Upon their meeting, Micaela plans to use Eva as a bait towards a human so that she can drink their blood and turn into a full-fledged vampire. The plan failed but an uncanny friendship blooms between the odd duo. What happens in the end? Well, tune in to find out!
It is a short story that'll have a maximum of 10 chapters as we are looking to do a small set of projects to catch up to a bigger one. The current project is GL themed and filled with fluff. We have a draft of the prologue, character designs and color palettes done by our team.

I would of course prefer some kind of payment as a writer or colorist, but I will look at unpaid projects if they strike my fancy. I have a preference for Fantasy stories with magic and romance. Dragons are a bonus. I will color line arts fully with my own style as shown clearly in the image below. This is a line art I drew myself mostly for practice and showcasing my coloring style:

67,"Lonely artist wanting to create webcomic, looking for someone to work with for I simply cannot work alone-",Collaborations,[],"Hi there! 
I just joined this forum because I am looking for a writing buddy / collaborator!

A bit about me, to start:
-I am 22 years old-and I speak English and German-my biggest inspiration have always been manga -and is thus what I want to draw-most web comics today are done in colour, but I honestly adore the black and white of old school manga -I have been drawing for half my life now, so all though unpolished, I consider myself at least quite okay.-out of the big ones my favourites are Black Butler (for the art) + Attack on Titan (for the writing)

So! 
I¬¥ve wanted to draw my own comic for a while now, and since I have a friend who likes to write we decided to pair up and work on a project together. But we had to put our project on ice before it ever really began since her life has other priorities for now. 
Perfectly understandable! 
But bad for me, because as it turns out I am quite shite at working on something on my own. Even all my own plots, and inkling ideas. If I don¬¥t have someone to talk about them in real time I can¬¥t seem to get my brain to do any storming.
Art I can do, but coming up with a coherent, engaging story? Not so much.
When I was  working as a team I enjoyed coming up with ideas and plot points, because I could always bounce them off my partner and get real time feedback. Now I¬¥m a stranded creative with no guidance or direction for my brain flow lol.
So really, what I¬¥m looking for is anything from:-a fellow artist who just wants to talk about their project, -a writer who wants to make a comic but has no artist to go along with it,-to a fellow artist slash  author, looking to collaborate on a project from its beginning to its end!
I¬¥d ideally like someone around my age (or atleast 18+), who would consider themselves at least semi good at what they¬¥re doing

69,Artist looking of work (unpaid),Collaborations,[],"Hello, Hakeem I've been a digital artist for a few years now and I'm looking to put out some sequential artwork. Now, while I'm willing to do some work unpaid there are a few requirements I'm looking for to help do this as smoothly as possible. 
Requirments

I'll only be doing short one-shots/first issues up to 25-30 pages max. As you can understand, nobody likes to do a large amount of work without some payoff. I'm not getting the benefit of creating the idea nor am I being paid so, please keep the workload to a minimum.
Story script must already be written up or you already have a storyboard of your comic/manga. If you don't have a solid concept yet or are still in the planning phase don't comment please as I won't be able to do anything until you do nor am I looking to help create a story from scratch at the moment. storyboards get bonus points here as I can just directly take the visual ideas you had and recreate them directly.
Some artwork will be shared on my deviant art. The main reason I'm doing this is to help with my creative workflow as well as get some more digital sequential work to post on my deviant art. 
No time limits. I'm not looking for any time-sensitive jobs at the moment being that I'm still working a 9-5 and doing another project behind the scenes. 
Communication and submission. I specifically use discord as it's the easiest and fastest response wise but I can send work using email if you prefer. I'll give my discord If accept your request.

So with those in mind feel free to dm me for work. You can find examples of my art here https://www.deviantart.com/theartwiseguy/gallery60","['I have a story planned.My discord : ReaperKing#3817Story title:Phantom ReaperSynopsis: Zack was just your average boy with an average life but everything changed on 20th July 1999.

70,Writer Looking for an Animator [Closed],Collaborations,[],"Thank you all so much. I found a pretty cool animator.
Hi! 
I came here last month to talk to others about one of my works, a manga called Moonlight Rising. I did find an amazing artist. There I mentioned working on another manga called The Mystery Of Tokyo Bay. 
Blurb: What would you do if you were sent to a wrecked station full of spirits of all kinds every time you slept? That is naps included. Would you investigate? Would you ignore it? Would you even sleep at all? Five people are sent to this world and each has its take. It is Mai Arashiro who one day realizes that in order to stop the dreams she has no choice but to figure out what happened. 
What connects them to the dreams? What is the cause of the wreck? Why is it that the longer you are in the dream, the closer you are to death? These five people grow together to answer those questions. After learning that these crashes had been ten years apart they know that to figure out what truly happened. Especially to stop another crash from happening. 
We already have an artist and both of us are signed under a great publisher but are in need of an animator. My publishers are called Horizon Publishing. They are on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and normally publish on Amazon books. I and my publisher are free to video chat and anything if you are interested. Also, feel free to ask questions or message me! My email is daiesha33@gmail.com","[""If you're asking for an animator, that is ... a lot. I can understand an artist, but an animator is a whole new step up."", "" \nI know. I had a meeting with my publisher and artist today and we were trying to figure out how to keep readers interested because my artist has a manga of his own he is working on so he doesn't know how it will affect the manga once it catches up to the same chapters he has now. So my publisher suggested finding an animator. \nSo one month a chapter is published and then another month we see the animated version. I mean this was the same process I found my artist so I decided to give it a try you know.\nHere we are now. "", 'Animation is literally a hundred hours of work for a few seconds of footage (Ok, something really simple might be a little better on the time vs. length of footage commitment, but I\'m going to guess if you say ""manga"", you\'re not looking for stick men). While a collab with an artist for a comic is... fine if both parties are ok with it, looking for a free animator (without even an estimate of what this ""profit"" would be) is unconscionable. I was thinking of animating some effects (not even characters) for my own pages and the time commitment was just too much for one person.\nETA: If you were looking for something super simple like animated glow effects, a writer can easily learn how to do that. Yes, it will take you a hundred hours to learn... But then at least you\'re not asking someone else to do it for free.', ""To be honest, normally I would have the number of how much of the percentage of profit I would give them but this time I am not sure. For example, I and the artist get 60% of the profit but we are splitting that. So I am not sure if the percentage would be given to the animator in-house or if I would have to, along with the artist give them a certain percentage. This would have to be talked about with the animator, the artist, my publisher, and me. It is so we can get an understanding. I hope that's understandable."", ""Hello, what kind of animations do you need? I usually animate my characters on After Effects, this is an example of what I usually do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_1JyQWtVfw16As you can see, they're really simple animations, but if this is what you need contact me  If you need something more difficult, I probably can't help you "", 'Hi! Your animations look amazing. I will have to ask my publisher about what he thinks will be best and definitely get back to you. Thank you so much!', 'Have you made any profit from your publisher? If so, you could use that money to hire an animator or two. Animating takes a lot of time and effort for mere seconds of footage.', 'Lol not yet. This is one of my first works with them. Believe me, if I did I would have defiently tried the paid option. The stress going through and finding an artist was enough to remind me of how tough it was when I did it.

72,"Story Editor, Co-Writer AND/OR Script Writer needed! [Unpaid]",Collaborations,[],"Before I start, please only apply if you are over 18! It'll just make me more comfortable. I finally graduated college, so I actually have time to work on a big project like this!
First up, I am inmost need of a Story Editor, I can technically do the rest myself (even if it would be better with help).  This is not my first time writing a comic, but it is my first time making one to actually be posted. If it ever make any money off it, you'll get a cut, but I'm not promising that we'll ever get to that stage. Other than that you'll be credited at the edit of every episode!
Secondly, I currently have the first 9 episodes written up as detailed summaries (some include rough dialogue but that is not my strong suit), and the first episode has almost entirely been rewritten as script. Generally, I would like to have them all edited before moving on to the scripting portion, but obviously episode 1 is an exception. Editing should just focus on the story and not dialogue.
Thirdly, the basic summary is that as our protagonist Conservation Regulator Drew returns home from making sure no-one has laid any traps to poach Frost Eagles, they notice that a small group of Skvaders (small horned bunny-birds) has been killed with their horns removed. Drew notes how strange this is (Skvader's are typically poached for their pelts which were left behind), but does not have any time left to investigate before they must return. The setting is the Aether, a separate plane from Earth, where magic is real. Its both fantasy and a little bit of sci-fi. (Drew uses they/them pronouns btw)
Fourth,  this may be a deal breaker for some, but there is a going to be a slow burn romance between Drew and a ""monster"" named Axdoul. It's very chaste, but I want to be upfront about that.
I made a discord server for this collab!  So just let me know what you'd like to contribute to, give me some examples of your work and your discord handle, so I can get in touch (message me on here if you don't want any of that public).
Lastly, Here's some very rough concept art to get a feel for the idea.

For background artists the comic would be set in different places, eg. there bridge/water and rock scenes, school scenes, jail scenes. So it would be very useful if you're comfortable drawing scenes like that.
I'm only accepting up to 5 artists at the moment even if the numbers up there add up to 7, because I already have 2 other artists that are yet to choose their positions

I've been drawing for almost twelve years (until a month and a bit ago it was just a hobby, but now I've decided to become more ""professional"" so to speak). I also write on occasion.By the way, my name is Agostina, nice to write to you! ^^.
Well... now I'll explain a little bit the context :D.In part and particularly, I would like to be able to find more works in Spanish (despite the original language, I enjoy the works in my mother tongue). At the same time I thank the authors for creating them and wanting to share them with us :^). 
Even so, referring only to Tapas, most of the authors who write in Spanish choose to publish it also in English in order to reach a wider audience, or directly it is only published in English. I have seen on the other hand that searching in the forum for any thread about, or related to Spanish, at most 50 results appear. Creating micro-communities and not joining what we already have.In this way English continues to remain influential on the site, and almost leaving out other languages and/or new audiences. Not that I am against this, on the contrary, but I think it would be good to expand what we have so far, to improve it. What do you think?
So what is my proposal and why have I decided to write this?Well, it is somewhat different to what is commonly requested or proposed in ""Collaborations"", since in this case it would consist of creating a kind of group that would be in charge of the translation and/or interpretation of the projects on the site. At the beginning we could receive the stories and after being adapted, pass them back to the author, who would then re-upload the chapters in the other language, with the corresponding credits at the end and including a message in case someone else is interested in this way of expanding his work in other languages. Or in case someone wants to contribute something as well.I think that in that instance there would be two ways (or more, although for now I have these) to carry out this project: The author can give us a file with the chapter/s without the texts, so we would add them (taking into account things like the typographies used and so on to stay faithful to the original), to finally pass it to him/her complete. Or else, the other thing would be to send him the translation/interpretation in a document for him to add them manually.
The initial idea is that this group would receive the projects of those people who would be interested in having us translate their work into Spanish from English and vice versa. (It could be expanded to other languages in the future if the circumstances are right).
I clarify that this would be an undefined time and unpaid project. Driven by the intention of wanting to make stories known to other languages, thus expanding the audience both in those stories and in Tapas itself. The author's rights would not be touched by this group, in other words and worth the redundancy, will remain the author. We would only take care of being able to transmit the work in other languages, as mentioned above.
I would like to see the growth of the creators we have here. In turn as that of the site (along with this proposal).It is also worth commenting, that this is my first publication in this forum, so opinions, comments, suggestions, among others that you can give me are welcome .
I look forward to your views and opinions on this (if any), and see if, or how, we can develop this in the best possible way.
Thanks so much for reading to the end!See you later, and have a great rest of the day! :D.
Contact info: You can send me a message to my forum account, leave a comment in this thread, or write me at this email acbnr28@gmail.com. I will try to respond as soon as possible with any of those options ^^. If this interests you and you would like to participate, don't hesitate to contact me.

Espa√±ol
Me presentar√© levemente: Pues, tengo 18 a√±os. Hace casi doce que dibujo (hasta hace un mes y pico solo ven√≠a siendo por hobby, pero ahora he decidido pasar a ser m√°s ""profesional"" por decirlo de alg√∫n modo). Tambi√©n escribo en ocasiones.Por cierto, me llamo Agostina, ¬°un gusto escribirles! ^^.
Bueno‚Ä¶ ahora paso a explicar un poco el contexto :D.En parte y particularmente, me gustar√≠a poder encontrar m√°s obras en espa√±ol (a pesar del idioma original, disfrutar las obras en mi lengua materna). A su vez agradezco a los autores por crearlas y querer compartirlas con nosotros :^). 
Aun as√≠, refiri√©ndome solo a Tapas, la mayor√≠a de los autores que escriben en espa√±ol optan por publicarla tambi√©n en ingl√©s para poder llegar a m√°s p√∫blico, o directamente solo se publica en ingl√©s. He visto por otro lado que buscando en el foro alg√∫n hilo sobre, o relacionado al espa√±ol, como mucho te aparecen 50 resultados. Creando micro-comunidades y no uniendo lo que ya tenemos.De esta forma sigue permaneciendo influyente el ingl√©s en el sitio, y casi dejando fuera a otros idiomas y/o p√∫blico nuevo. No es que est√© en contra de esto, al contrario, pero pienso que estar√≠a bueno expandir lo que se tiene hasta ahora, mejorarlo. ¬øQu√© piensas?
Entonces ¬øcu√°l es mi propuesta y por la que he decidido escribir esto?Pues, es un tanto diferente a lo que suelen solicitar o proponer com√∫nmente en ‚ÄúColaboraciones‚Äù, ya que en este caso consistir√≠a en armar o crear una especie de grupo que se encargue de la traducci√≥n y/o interpretaci√≥n de los proyectos habidos y por haber en el sitio. Que en un principio se puedan recibir las historias y despu√©s de ser adaptadas pas√°rselas de nuevo al autor, as√≠ este luego re-subir√≠a los cap√≠tulos en el otro idioma, con los cr√©ditos correspondientes al final del mismo e incluyendo un mensaje por si a alguien m√°s le interesa esta forma de expandir su obra en otros idiomas. O por si se quiere aportar algo tambi√©n.Pienso que en esa instancia habr√≠a dos formas (o m√°s, aunque por ahora tengo estas) para realizar este proyecto: Puede el autor darnos un archivo con el/los cap√≠tulo/s sin los textos, as√≠ nosotros los agregar√≠amos (teniendo en cuenta cosas como las tipograf√≠as que utiliza y dem√°s para mantenernos fieles al original), para finalmente pas√°rselo completo. O sino, la otra cosa ser√≠a enviarle en un documento la traducci√≥n/interpretaci√≥n para que √©l los ponga manualmente.
La idea inicial, es que este grupo recibiera los proyectos de aquellas personas a las que les interesar√≠a que pas√°ramos su obra a espa√±ol del ingl√©s y viceversa. (Se podr√≠a expandir a otros idiomas en un futuro si se dan las circunstancias).
Aclaro que esto ser√≠a un proyecto de tiempo indefinido y no remunerado. Impulsado por la intenci√≥n de querer dar a conocer historias al resto de idiomas ampliando as√≠, el p√∫blico tanto en esas historias como en el mismo Tapas. Los derechos de autor no se tocar√≠an por parte de este grupo, en otras palabras y valga la redundancia, seguir√°n siendo del autor. Solo nos encargar√≠amos de poder transmitir la obra en otros idiomas, como se ha dicho anteriormente.
Me gustar√≠a ver el crecimiento de los creadores que tenemos aqu√≠. A su vez como la del sitio (junto con esta propuesta).Tambi√©n cabe comentar, que es mi primera publicaci√≥n en este foro, por lo que las opiniones, comentarios, sugerencias, entre otras que puedan aportarme son bienvenidas .
Espero curiosa por sus puntos de vista y opiniones al respecto (si es que llega a haber), y ver si, o c√≥mo, podemos desarrollar esto de la mejor manera posible.
¬°Muchas gracias por leer hasta el final!Hasta luego, y ¬°muy buen resto del d√≠a! :D.

Tratar√© de responder en la brevedad con cualquiera de esas opciones ^^. Si esto te interesa y quisieras participar, no dudes en contactarme.","['Hola. Bienvenida.\nEn resumen: Te ofreces como traductora gratis del ingl√©s al espa√±ol y del espa√±ol al ingl√©s (¬ø?) ¬øo solo te ofreces a que otros lo hagan y tu lo manejas? ¬øC√≥mo los grupos de traducci√≥n pirata de mangas pero en esta ocasi√≥n siendo legales y traduciendo a artistas independientes de Tapas pero con su permiso?\neh... si es que tienes inter√©s de ofrecer la traducci√≥n del ingl√©s al espa√±ol, el mercado est√° con las personas que hablan ingl√©s y tendr√≠as que poner tu anuncio de colaboraci√≥n en √©se idioma porque como t√∫ misma has notado, te ignoran feo y por eso los que hablamos espa√±ol terminamos siendo forzados tambi√©n a seguir usando ese idioma.\n perdona, es demasiado texto y las ideas muy dispersas en todo el post ', ""Used a translator and I'm using one to reply! My Spanish is too rusty ^^;\n¬øQu√© pasa?\nMe gusta esta idea, ¬°y creo que es muy buena! La √∫nica experiencia que tengo con la traducci√≥n es del japon√©s al ingl√©s, pero tambi√©n he hecho un poco de traducci√≥n del espa√±ol al ingl√©s en mis clases en el secundario.\nTengo un mont√≥n de proyectos diferentes en los que estoy trabajando actualmente, pero si esta idea despega, ¬°no me importar√≠a ayudar! ¬°S√© c√≥mo borrar y colocar los textos para los c√≥mics, y creo que tambi√©n ser√≠a una buena manera de trabajar en mi espa√±ol un poco m√°s!"", 'Hola.\nS√≠, en realidad como dices en resumen ser√≠a algo as√≠. Aunque no me ofrezco como traductora, ya que de momento solo s√© espa√±ol, y pocas cosas dispersas de otros idiomas. B√°sicamente me molesta eso de m√≠, la incapacidad y la poca experiencia que aun trato de resolver sobre ese tema, que de igual forma en estos casos me servir√≠a para reforzar en peque√±a medida lo que propongo y que si lo fuese, tambi√©n lo har√≠a gratuitamente por otros motivos en parte. Pero lo quise exponer y proponer ya que hay gente capaz de ello, m√°s capacitada que uno y que si les interesa el intentar sacar adelante esta idea, a la cual le veo potencial, quisiera pedir su participaci√≥n. Tampoco ser√≠a manejarlos, no me siento c√≥moda con ello exactamente. M√°s bien ir√≠a por el hecho de impulsar y conversarlo entre todos, y no meramente ser uno solo el que dirija. Escucharnos, o leernos en este caso y ver qu√© podemos aportar para mejorar en lo posible.\nY s√≠. La idea viene de siempre tener en cuenta la palabra del autor, pedir los permisos correspondientes y dem√°s para desarrollar esto. No ser√≠a una ""traducci√≥n"" oficial quiz√°s, pero por lo menos se podr√≠a extender a otras lenguas.\nEntiendo, y lo he pensado tambi√©n. Pero, si lo pongo en ingl√©s solo lo seguir√≠a reforzando m√°s, entonces por lo menos si va a pasar, lo expreso en este idioma y veo c√≥mo puedo desenvolverlo conforme avanzamos.\nNo te preocupes, comprendo. No es la primera vez que me lo han llegado a decir, ja...\nGracias por la respuesta tambi√©n ^^.', 'Esta bien, muchas gracias ^^.\nMe alegra saberlo, tanto el inter√©s como la experiencia mencionada. Tambi√©n tengo algunos proyectos, diferentes a este tema como tal, pero de igual forma quer√≠a intentar. \nVeremos c√≥mo se desarrolla esto, y en base a eso te tendr√© en cuenta.\nMuchas gracias de nuevo! :D.', 'Gracias por responder.S√≠, es verdad, hay que promover m√°s posts en otros idiomas.\nMis preguntas anteriores eran m√°s para confirmar de qu√© va tu propuesta y qu√© es lo que realmente est√° m√°s a tierra tanto para el que ofrece el servicio como para el que lo pida (que sepa qu√© es lo que puede o no pedir) del grupo.\nNo te critico la idea, porque en realidad muchos artistas y autores necesitan de alguien que les ayude tanto en traducci√≥n como en revisi√≥n de ortograf√≠a y gram√°tica incluso de su propio idioma. Este servicio es necesario y muchos de los artistas que desean esto no tienen el dinero para pagar a un especialista en esto.\nSin embargo, la mayor√≠a de las personas que postean aqu√≠ son dichos artistas y autores con poco tiempo para colaborar en esto, lamentablemente. De ah√≠ mis consultas anteriores.Por tanto, que ofreces t√∫ como la que ha tenido esta iniciativa, a ver si otros se animan para concretar mejor esta idea.', 'No hay de qu√©.\nJaja, no, muchas gracias a ti. Esto de cierta forma me ayuda a preguntarme o cuestionarme m√°s lo que se puede llegar a hacer y aporta. Me creo y siento capaz, por m√°s que no sepa por ejemplo en este caso otros idiomas de igual forma que el espa√±ol, de aprender o intentarlo por m√°s que lleve algo de tiempo y parezca dif√≠cil, pero no imposible. Lo que s√≠, como digo, no me gusta depender de cosas como esta, pero s√© que me cuesta hasta cierto punto y no puedo negarme a avanzar por algo as√≠. Por eso termino de √∫ltima compartiendo mi punto de vista, el sentir y pensamiento, terminando en divagaciones que al final tienen un punto en com√∫n, amplio y general, pero en com√∫n.\nTampoco puedo exigir a otro lo que yo no puedo o cuesta (y ni aun as√≠ lo har√≠a en caso contrario), ya que soy m√°s libre en ese aspecto, y me gustar√≠a poder conversarlo abierta y tranquilamente, antes que extra√±a y fr√≠amente. \nAcepto que no s√© nada, por lo que quisiera aprender de otros y junto a otros, que por m√°s que posean experiencia en algo (y tiene su utilidad) no les moleste esto y quieran seguir viendo cosas ""nuevas"".\nTambi√©n tuve en cuenta que la mayor√≠a (por no decir todos) los que se encuentran en estos foros suelen ser artistas y autores, m√°s que las dem√°s personas en general que no andan desarrollando una historia entre otras cosas y pueden tener m√°s habilidades fuera de lo que es la escritura o dibujo principalmente.\nY bueno, cada vez que me pongo a pensar y darle vueltas a qu√© cosas puedo aportar, estas no se relacionan tanto a este tipo de proyecto. S√© tejer, pero de qu√© sirve en un tema de traducci√≥n si es que no se habla sobre eso? Puedo ""dibujar"", o ""escribir"" pero el primero no es de gran requerimiento para esto y el escribir quiz√° sea solo para arreglar, componer alg√∫n que otro texto, aunque tiene su importancia en parte. Tal vez pueda ayudar con colocar textos, pero solo si el autor decide pasarnos un archivo con las p√°ginas limpias. Puedo ver algunos temas con inform√°tica, pero siguen siendo pocos y reducidos en contenido. Al final tengo varias habilidades levemente desarrolladas, pero siempre va a depender de lo que se quiera hacer o lograr. Cada proyecto tiene lo suyo, y s√© que puedo moldearme de alguna manera a ello y tratar de encontrale varios caminos para llevarlo de la mejor manera que se pueda. \nNo puedo asegurar nada u ofrecerlo, ya que ni yo lo s√© o tengo sabido con certeza. Pero siempre se puede intentar, si no funciona de tal forma se probara de otra, hasta que de resultado acorde a lo que se espera o quisiera conseguir.\nCreo que a lo sumo, una experiencia de aquello abstracto a materializar y que tiene posibilidad de moldearse en conjunto.', 'Perdona que soy muy directo a la hora de hablar, no lo hago con √°nimo de ofender.\nNo creo que seas una persona incapaz de ayudar aunque sea de forma limitada, t√∫ misma has dicho el tipo de cosas que sabes hacer en relaci√≥n a lo que est√°s proponiendo (y otras sin relaci√≥n) el punto es enfocarse primero en lo que se puede y despu√©s ver que se aprende conforme vas ganando experiencia o confianza de hacer con cada artista, pero tienes que decirlo, no divagar.\nLa idea es muy buena y necesaria (aunque hay puntos legales no conversados), pero no le veo que vaya a avanzar sin una persona que se responsabilice por concretarla y a la forma tangencial que me has respondido he concluido que solo estas tirando la idea para que otro lo haga. \nBueno, en fin, buena suerte.', 'Can someone say what this topic about??', 'OP was proposing if someone would create a group to translate Tapas works (for free)', 'OhThanks for the reply']",7/16/2021 19:34,https://forums.tapas.io/t/proposal-to-create-a-general-group-of-translations-for-the-works-in-tapas-propuesta-de-crear-un-grupo-general-de-traducciones-para-las-obras-en-tapas-unpaid-no-remunerado/61749

84,Artist looking for writer(s) for an energetic workplace comedy,Collaborations,[],"Um, hello. You all know me. ^^; I'm not entirely sure if this is a good idea...but I suddenly realized that the limiting resource in comic communities is usually artists, not writers, and that if there are some writers around who would just really like to be part of a comic-making experience if only an artist would give them a chance, then I think I can offer an opportunity.

r&amp;ks.png651x927 20 KB

So this is some concept art for a sort of workplace comedy I've been trying and failing to write for a couple years now. The main characters are these two young ladies, who are biology department mail-workers for a college campus...on another planet. ^^ 
And I know the job description is kind of niche (there are probably very few comics about mail workers, and even fewer about something this specific) but it's not hard to explain: basically, these are the people who make sure researchers get all the stuff they need. Their test tubes, their refrigerators, their live samples, their high-end sneakers and candy bars (those last two are based on true stories~). I can explain more of the ins and outs and common frustrations to anyone I'm interested in working with.
Anyway, I WANT to write it, but I think it keeps turning out bad because I'm just too close to the subject matter. This is why I stopped trying to do slice-of-life comics about myself and my experiences long ago; they end up too rage-y or too explain-y and leave very little room for funny. I hate to say it, but I may actually REQUIRE help for this.
Okay, now that the background is out of the way, here's a rundown of what I'm looking for:
Genre: Slice-of-life
Format: No specifics, but each ep must be relatively SHORT. If you can write 4-komas, you'll be good at this. If you don't know what a 4-koma is, think newspaper strips.
Tone: This is a silly, absurdist action comedy, designed to propel even weak jokes with the characters' funny faces and gestures. Conversational strips should be the norm, but more active scenes every now and then (e.g. chases, fistfights) are to be expected.
What I can provide:-The talents of an experienced artist who has been drawing comics for 5+ years ^^-Lengthy bios and backgrounds on the characters and world, including possible character development arcs-Writing help! I do have a few good ideas...-Credit, so much credit. If you have an account on any site I post the comic on, I'll be glad to link you or otherwise shove your name in there.
What I CAN'T provide:-Money. There is no money. If you're looking to get hired, you can leave now. ^^; On the off chance that the comic becomes popular and there IS money involved, well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it because I wouldn't count on it.-A strict schedule. If things go well, I can probably buckle down and do at least a strip a week, but I make no promises. Although that's kind of good for you too; there's no pressure on you to gimme the goods by a certain deadline. If for any reason you can't get a script done, no worries.-Exposure. I will definitely credit you, but don't expect to ride my coattails to the bank or anything. I am far from famous...
What I expect:-SCRIPTS. With art direction if you've got it; if there's something specific I need to draw in order to make your joke work you need to say so.-Nothing unsafe for work, please. Some cursing is okay, one of the main characters curses quite a lot, actually, but don't think you're writing for Adult Swim or anything.-Communication: a Google Doc or some kind of space where we can share and store text and images would be ideal, but apart from that I'd like to check in from time to time, at least so we both know we're still alive. Or if you're leaving the country or something and won't be able to write for 3 weeks...I wanna know about stuff like that.-Autonomy: Most of the time, you should be able to at least write a script from start to finish before asking for my opinion. Please don't expect to have your hand held as we write each episode line-by-line together; I'm looking for a partner, not a student.
Other stuff you should know:-This may sound a little harsh, but: this concept is mine, and I won't draw something that I don't think suits it. That being said, I have the final say when it comes to 'canon'. If you want to talk to people about your ideas for the comic, feel free, but don't expect me to back you up if you say something I don't agree with.-I can concede, though...my vision for each character (especially the many side characters) is not set in stone; if you have ideas that alter or even contradict whatever background I give to you, I still want to hear them and discuss them.-I'm open to having multiple writers~. You'll be expected to play nice together.
What I want RIGHT NOW:So, if you're interested in this, hit me up (you can talk to me in private if you prefer), introduce yourself, and most importantly, AUDITION!
I wanna see what you can do! Show me previous scripts from other short comics (or funny moments from longer-form comics), or just make something up on the spot! 2 or 3 examples at least would be nice, I'd be pretty disappointed to end up with a 1-hit wonder...
Before I go, here's a bit of a primer for anyone intending to make something up. Please ask if you have any questions; thank you and good night~.
Characters


Kcla Lluco: The pink one. Positive and friendly, but more mellow than outgoing. In regards to her job, she just wants to make sure all the patrons get the help they need. Interests include gardening, manga, and karaoke.

Ronmin Praw: The hairy one. Pessimistic, competitive, and full of repressed rage (more intimidating than actually mean, though). She doesn't seem to like her job, and she's overqualified for it, but for reasons unknown she stays. Interests include clothing design, music, and cooking.

Common TasksSigning in packages, emailing people who forget to pick up their packages, picking up mail, sorting mail, delivering mail to the different buildings around campus, figuring out what to do with mail addressed to persons unknown, making copies of exams and worksheets for professors, giving various office supplies to students and researchers who walk in and ask for them.","[""Hi @DokiDokiTsuna, I'm interested in collaborating in a Slice-of-life project with you.In this link I put some of the rough drafts of mine:\n\n\nWriter and Artist seeking collab: (Paid/Unpaid) / (Fantasy/Slife of Life) / (Comic) Collaboration\n\n\n    Writer seeking collab:      (Paid/Unpaid) / (Fantasy/Slife of Life) / (Comic) Paid Writer:     My Deliverables: 3-4 workdays a week, up to 8 pages a day, may vary due to revisions.
