2,"“Lanche”, a textless comic [one-shot]",Announcements,[],"Hey there! 
DAKÍCORP's comics have been brought to Tapas for a while now, but most of them (if not all) are in brazilian portuguese.
Recently Café Espacial lauched a contest for their new printed issue and the theme was Comics without words (5 pages max per story). My wife and I always wanted to create something together since the beginning of our relationship, so we saw this as a nice opportunity to experiment. She handled the writing and I was responsible for the drawings. Lanche didn't make it to the selected ones, but we really enjoyed working together in this. It's a really quick read, so if you're interested it is already available on Tapas.

However, I’m excited to inform you that we didn’t create the Tapastry brand just to be cute and have an Instagram account (although I love it very much. @tapastry_TCC, follow it! ;D). You can expect to see more changes on our app and website that will bring more visibility to talented independent creators. This has been in the works for many months and I can’t wait to share more with you in the future!!\nI\'m happy to see the current issues with visibility for independent series being acknowledged by the staff, since it\'s an area I\'ve known to be... let\'s say ""passionately vocal"" about (some would, I\'m sure, say ""obnoxious""). I\'m optimistic for some positive changes in the hopefully near future. I\'m hoping that the cash injection from this deal as well as the fivefold increase in revenue will allow Tapas to invest in original works in the hopes of growing future breakout series and diversifying the audience.', ""Is this going to effect Tapas' current stance on mature content?

(after the rumor about Kakao in the other thread).\nWhat\'s up with the blatant lies? Well, now the cats out of the bag and once again Tapas looks like a fool.', ""\n\nratique:\nAre you going to make any changes to Tapas’ publishing guidelines and rules?No. As an independent creator you continue to own your series, images, IP and so on. Tapas will never claim ownership over your series, so feel free to continue publishing without worry.\nThis is good to see reiterated, thank you.  As an author with a series that's part of a very expansive extended universe, one which I've worked on for a decade and hope to make my bread and butter for the rest of my life, the mere whiff of IP issues sends a chill down my spine.\nAlso, fingers crossed for more love going to the indie creators on the app and website! I'm excited to hear what you have planned."", ""I actually find this to be both a good opportunity and interesting direction for Tapas. Over the last month or so there has been so much positive news between the new websites designs and also how some of the original stories are now getting opportunities to become other media pieces like published books and a tv show. Then there was the creation of Tapastry as well. \nFrom a writer's perspective looking that its Kakao Entertainment I can think of all of the possibilities opened for creators both Comic artists and novelist when it comes to getting their original work out there. Whether its through publishing, video games, animes, and other media outlets. I'm looking forward to seeing how things progress from here and what new opportunities open up for the community. \nI would like to thank the staff from Tapas who continues to work tirelessly in maintaining the forums and the website as a whole. I hope that the community and original content continue to grow from these many opportunities that could be presented."", ""If were being completely optimistic then yeah this would mean more opportunities for more creators. But as far as I can tell at least at this point in my opinion it would be the same types of stories that are getting promoted now, getting promoted.\nEven if there's a new staff pick style thing the method to choosing what and who to promote is probably still same and it leaves a lot to be desired.\nAnyway. I have a couple questions.\n@ratique \n• From what you can say and are aware of what types of changes/improvements will be made to the support system?\nAn example of what I mean is accessibility to ink. Methods to encourage support.\n• Will there be improvements/new methods of monetization?\nI personally think the Ad revenue set up could use a touch up.\n• Are there any plans to improve site wide engagements?\n• Will there be larger focus on searching for content and creators to make the move to premium?\nI ask this because I've been checking out Webtoons lately and noticed that comparativewise while I acknowledge that Webtoons is a larger site/has a larger budget, the number of canvas to originals is much larger than non premium to premium.\nBy this I mean series that move over to Originals.\nIt feels like the premium upgrade is now a rarity.\n• This one is probably off topic but is the idea behind Tapastry to separate Tapas Originals and Premium from the regular self published stuff. Similar to Webtoon canvas and Webtoon originals?\nI feel like I may have read the answer somewhere but I forgot."", ""Honestly, I really dislike this. Tapas was a shining beacon for independent web entertainment, and in one fell swoop it's become just another piece of some massive conglomerate. Now the media conglomerates control almost all of the entire web comics industry, and I can't think this will be good in the long run. \nRadish and Tapas are now owned by the same company, so what does this mean for Tapas's novel section? The sites have very different types of stories, but I can't imagine they will stay separated for very long.\nThis is just my overall pessimism about lumbering major corporations, though. Maybe Tapas will come out even better for this!  But it does break my heart a little bit every time an independent company is absorbed by a much bigger one."", ""I never said Tapas wasn't doing any of this stuff or wasn't working on this stuff. I specifically asked in the confines of this investment. It's like if you plan on buying a new car but now you have a bigger budget. Are you getting one with heated seats, ect.\nBut I will say Tapas team could be working on whatever, whenever but there's really no way for me to be aware of that fact beforehand. All I know is what's on my side of the fence.  I completely understand not being able to give a clear cut answer and I wasn't expecting one.\nFor further clarification I can only ask and base stuff on what I've observed if there's an issue repeatedly being brought up for example and the Tapas team is working on it. \nThe non team side either has to wait until whatever the fix/improvement is ready or if the Tapas team provides some information. Otherwise we'd never know if something's being done. \nAnyways thanks for taking the time to respond I always appreciate it. This was very informative for me for a number of reasons."", ""Cool that both Tapas and Kakao have nearly the same color scheme.\n(I know I'm making a point that has no value, but I just noticed it.)""]",5/11/2021 11:25

I'm just concerned that if that were the case, the community content would be promoted to a relatively small audience comprised only of other creators, limiting our ability to grow. The audience of readers on Tapas is so much bigger than the audience of readers who are also creators, and it's a much harder audience for many of us to reach. It would be good to know if there had been some consideration of this.\nI do appreciate this move towards promotion of home-grown content, particularly with the heavy recent focus on translated complete comics on the site and social media, and I hope that it might help combat the sub gain stagnation many of us have experienced over the past several months since the changes to the site layout and algorithms."", 'Is this building social media presence for TAPAS itself or for its creators?

I\'m paving the path for future women to travel.

I\'m making something I love, and that I hope brings joy to other women who read it. I\'m also a lesbian, and so I write lesbian characters. Creating characters and stories about gay women and their lives let\'s me show a category of women that we can exist in media. Writing gay women to be more than just a side kick or a creepy stalker or dead in season, I\'m drawing the stories I wished I saw so long ago.

It\'s absolutely frustrating to see women constantly portrayed as the sidekick to a male-centric cast, or shoved into the arms of a male lead for the sake of being a romantic interest. Women can do so much more, and we don\'t always have to be thrust into the arms of the main male lead. As a bisexual woman, I try to showcase how there\'s more than one route when it comes to the love interest and I want to create grand worlds with amazingly strong, beautiful, and talented women characters who don\'t outshine the men, but rather they coexist with them.

From living with an abusive father to not being able to get a decent college place for my dream job, all because ""more qualified"" men where more interesting. Because of childhood trauma, I was diagnosed with depression, a mental illness that a lot of young and old women struggle with. What I found helps me cope is writing. My story is my escape from reality, I use it as my fuel to be able to overcome my obstacles and struggles just like Seraphina does. In my novel, I want to display the countless highs and ups of life, the struggles, the low falls and the high rises. It\'s important to give people something that shows them a realistic way of life, with all it\'s ugly and pretty sides. I want to wrap it into the fantasy world of my novel to get the important messages across and comfort and help women like me.

My women are not simply content to wait on the sidelines.  My women are still feminine and confident in their beauty and sexuality while also aiming for high goals.  Heck, sometimes my women are princesses who are kind, and yet their power still brings fear.  My characters won\'t compromise and neither do I.  I have often been described as aggressive, smart (and smart-acting), and intimidating, which is just fine.  My role models are often described the same and my characters will reflect that influence.

As a result, I wanted to tell a story that represented my humanity, tenaciousness, curiosity and passion for all that is unknown about the world - and I wanted to tell it visually. That meant comics; that meant another outwardly male sphere. I wanted to show a girl who is smart, who loves to tinker and engineer, but who also is not ashamed of her femininity, but rather who openly embraces it.

","[""This looks really cool and very well done but I noticed you don't have as many subs or views as I personally think you should. I hope you don't mind me giving some advice that will make the comic flourish at least a little bit. (I haven't read though all of it so I might miss some things).\n1) GenreThe only genre you have checked on Tapas is romance, and while I'm sure romance is a part of the story, this is very obviously an action focused comic from the tags you have in the details to the cover of the first chapter. Tapas now allows for more than one genre, 3 in total, listed so I think you should change the first genre to action, them make the second genre romance or whatever else genre you like that fits your story.\n2) Episode length.Right now, each episode has an entire chapter worth of content. For Tapas, a platform that advertises shorter, more easily consumable episode lengths (1-5 pages, 6-12 panels), the amount of content per update may put potential readers off. I've seen that you started the manga in 2019, but you only have 6 episodes and extremely long periods of time between each update. Because of all of that, people are not seeing your manga in the fresh section of Tapas nor in the popular section because of low engagement. My recommendation is to start from scratch reuploading smaller episodes of no more that 5 pages weekly or biweekly. Because you're already on the 6th chapter, you should have enough of a buffer so that there aren't long empty periods between updates. \n3) FormattingI'm assuming the pages are formatted the way they are to fit the long form scroll format of webcomic platforms, but you don't have to do that if it makes the manga harder to read. There's a place for page style formatting in the webcomic sphere and people likely won't hold it against your work if it's good. Also, action comics, specifically action scenes, tend to be harder to read or don't flow as well when they're in scroll format compared to page format. So I recommend uploading full pages instead of cutting panels up to fit the scroll format.\n4) EditingThis is a personal gripe, I guess. Panels are duplicated and zoomed in on throughout the first chapter at least. It's very weird and jarring to read because it messes up the flow of the reading experience. Instead of an action scene being fast-paced and energetic, things are slowed down so the reader look at a panel they've already seen. This kind of editing can work if you want to put emphasis on certain panels, but to do it for every panel is not good.\nI think you and your artist have very good work here and I'm genuinely willing to give thin manga chance. I just think some things should change first if you want to reach a broader audience on Tapas.""]",1/29/2021 21:16

Spread the support from the forums to the front page!



Thread to boost black comic creators here on Tapas! Events


    Hey all. The situation is real rough right now. I really want all of us to give support, love, and specifically likes and comments to black comic creators here on Tapas! 

So, if you're a black creator or know of a comic by a black creator, please post links down below and let's start giving some love and boosting these stories. I feel as a community it is the least we can do. I'll start us off with a few links. 


 
 

And here's a quick pastepin link I found of more black webcomic creators not…
  

","['Thanks so much!  Looking forward to finding even more stories!', 'I would suggest you read up on the situation in the US before speaking anymore on this topic. It seems like you are missing some crucial information, and I implore you to educate yourself on why it is to important to lift up voices like this right now. Thank you!', 'Thanks for your answer, that is really much more friendly, looking forward to new horizons, have a good day)', 'One of the big focuses in terms of financial contributions is towards front line bail and legal fees.\nThat can be done at national levels and local. Plenty of organizations could use that support.', 'How about supporting small businesses in black communities?. One of the current struggles due to the covid is paying the costs of adapting the small businesses so employees can work from home. Also the fact that with the current situation many small businesses are getting broke and that means more people are getting unemployed.', ""I haven't been on Tapas that long. And when it comes to any creators backgrounds I dont really know. \nAs for me personally I'm spilt since I just posted my first episodes yesterday. And I'd honestly love the chance to promote my work. But at the same time I want my work to shine for itself.\n🤷\u200d♂️"", 'god, as long as you don’t pull the same shit you’re doing with pride month. make sure it’s black creators making black comics, not white creators with a poc mc', 'Well... Create space for black voices on the platform for a start. You’ve done it for LGBTQ and BL/GL. Creation of perhaps a BIPOC “genre” may also be a good step, or encouraging writers who write from their own marginalised experiences to submit for featuring opportunities. Encourage use of tags more, perhaps, to indicate this kind of information and make the search work to actually pick this up properly. \nThere are interview spots that you guys sometimes do. Get some black voices on those, and yes, promote their work. But also move beyond that and speak to them about the issues that also are still faced in posting/creating/publishing work.\nEncourage sensitive conversations around diversity, both on the forums and through content put out by Tapas itself. Educate your community. \nDo a social media call that asks the black community what they want from Tapas. Just being real, there aren’t many on the forums because the forums aren’t that comfortable for many marginalised people. You’ll get a better response on Twitter/Insta/FB. \nDedicate lists on the front page to elevating black voices throughout the year. Black History Month aside, there’s also Africa Day, and other identities that can be pulled in and celebrated more in that way. \nHire someone who is able to look at your business model and assess where the bottlenecks are that are stopping black creators come forward. \nActively search for black and BIPOC voices to elevate, and if they’re not on Tapas yet, find out why and reach out to some creators to bring them on board. \nJust some ideas.', 'What about something like ""Creator Spotlight""? Ask black storytellers to give what they think about what\'s going on, how does it make them feel, and any other questions you would have, but most importantly, will they keep creating?', 'I belive the best way is too listen to what they need, what they been asking for, and let they be in charge as well, allow them to have agency in how their work can apear in the spotlight, create a spotlight section on the main page that is hard to miss  and that everyone can see it.', ""Don't exclude black authors writing novels either. Not every artist is making comics, and I would appreciate being able to sift through novels written by black authors made easier. "", ""I just want to say thank you. That's all. I stopped going on social media outlets for a bit and decided to retreat here to the tapas forums and focus on my comics as a form of escapism, and I just want to say the support on here really means a lot, and thank you for creating a safe space for so many different people here on this platform."", 'Yeah, novel promotion so far does seem to be a little behind comic promotions. \nAlso just to be clear is the requirement black creators specifically telling black stories. Or is this to share the stories of black creators? And some form of verification would be nice, since this is to genuinely uplift voice that normally might not be heard, This does lead to a question as to how verification would be done.\nFor example my actually name is Adeleke Kayode, so my initials are AK which is how you get Aykay as my username, it also fits easier on a book cover than my full name. Adeleke in Yoruba means ""The crown of god""\nI am Nigerian American. And that\'s true. But how do you know that\'s true? I\'m personally on the fence about putting the link to my work because I feel like there are other people who have been members of Tapas much longer than me, who\'ve definitely deserve and have earned the right to have their work promoted. But at the same time it feels like a bad move for me to not acknowledge an opportunity.\n@ratique Do you have any suggestions? I really am conflicted here.', ""I could definitely see how it would be problematic to have a verification step. I don't know it's just a little weird for me since I joined Tapas in April and then joined the forums in May. And I've only participated in a handful of posts. So I guess I'm still not used to being here.\nHere's my story.\n\ntapas.io17\n\n\n\nMaho no Ken | Tapas\nHe’s got a goal in mind, one singular goal. To reach it he’ll need strength and a lot of it. What better place to cultivate his abilities than a prestigious magic school? \n\nYuuto Mamoru will need more than just his power to make it through. If he...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""It can be both, but come on there is more to us we're more than just what we've been experiencing. There's more to our tales than just the racism, discrimination and black experience. We can tell ALL kinds of tales, and THAT is what we need to be seen for. Not just the group with yet another label for the people to add, we can ascend in much better ways.\nTake the opportunity, we've been fighting for too long and too hard.""]",6/2/2020 18:32
18,100% Revenue and Book Covers for Creators!,Announcements,[],"[This is copy and pasted from the newsletter sent out this morning but I wanted to post it here for posterity - I'll also be answering questions regarding the contents within the newsletter! Feel free to tag me]
Hey hi hello creators, 
We hope you've been staying safe and healthy amidst the current health epidemic. To do our part to help creators and readers during these times, we'll be hosting a number of different events throughout the month of April. 
To start us off, we'll be waiving all fees and commissions related to the Ad Revenue and Support Programs starting April 3rd, meaning creators will be receiving 100% of the revenue generated by both programs. We'll also be providing readers with information on how to white-list Tapas to better support creators during this time, along with a number of free Ink gifts and discounts. We hope you'll take part in spreading awareness to your fans of this event. 
We'll be debuting a landing page specifically for the event similar to our previous Inksgiving page to help readers and creators connect more. 
Later on, we'll be hosting an Easter Egg hunt featuring over 75 unique creators. We hosted this event last year and garnered a record high number of comments over the three day event. We'll be giving out free Ink as rewards to participants along with a note to encourage readers to support their favorite creators. 
!BOOK COVERS ARE GOING LIVE!
We’re happy to announce that Book Covers will soon be available to use on the website and apps. You can now start uploading your covers and see them live on Tapas! We saw some amazing covers in the making as we worked on this and we’re very thrilled to see them come to life on our site! We hope that you’ll join us in this excitement!
For those who haven't heard or started their covers yet, here’s a breakdown of details:
Book Covers are at a 1:1.5 ratio, 960 x 1440px
We recommend working at 1920px x 2880px and exporting at 50% for best results
Titles are required and should take up about 1/3rd of the image*
Book Covers will become a Requirement for your series on July 31st, 2020.
Stories without Book Covers will still appear within the app and website normally.
*Titles are Required as series titles will no longer appear under the image like it did with Thumbnails.
Additionally, we made a basic template to help you get started, so feel free to check out our FAQ page when it goes live under the Tools for Creators Section. There, you should find a PSD template located near the bottom of the article.
I hope that you have fun creating and uploading covers for your stories! If you experience any trouble with this new feature, please reach out to and let us know at Feedback@tapas.io
We'll also be making a number of changes to the newly launched look and feel of the website based on creator feedback. We appreciate the support, patience and understanding of the community as we recognize Tapas is a work in progress and we hope to continually make adjustments and improvements. 
I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for being part of the community and continuing to publish with us. The recent health epidemic has forced the entirety of our staff to begin working remotely. While we have taken extra precautions to ensure the safety and well-being of staff members, we are constantly thinking of the creator community and trying to find ways to help support as many creators during this time as possible. 
The staff has found the stories on Tapas to be immensely inspirational and comforting, and wanted to express our heartfelt gratitude. Sheltering in place and the recent news within the pop-culture entertainment sector has proven that stories, especially stories from a community as diverse and creative as ours have never been more important than right now. Stories have the opportunity to provide entertainment, comfort, escape, catharsis, community and so much more. 
Thank you again for providing the staff with the comfort of such wonderful stories. These stories have continually inspired us to work harder and remain hopeful. I'm sure your fans all feel the same way. Thank you.   
All the best, -Michael from Tapas

Edit 05/01/20
Due to the ongoing nature of the Covid-19 situation, we felt that it was necessary to continue extending the event for another couple of weeks beyond the original planned dates. We've raised over $10,000 from the Support Program alone, and we've seen a record number of payouts for creators this past month and have been working extra hard to keep fill rates for our watch-to-earn ads as accessible as possible.
Seeing the generosity and support from the community has been incredibly uplifting, and has definitely motivated us to take this opportunity to work even harder to ensure that more creators gain access to these resources.
I wanted to extend a special thank you to @KRWilliams and every creator involved in the #ThankYouTapas event (https://forums.tapas.io/t/thankyoutapas-event-starts-today/43246/). It was an immense surprise and the entire staff is overwhelmed from the kindness - our Slack channel was flooded with happy emojis and gifs all day from that.
I also wanted to extend another special thank you to @ratique who has joined the Tapas staff full time and will in charge of creator happiness - she'll be engaging with the community and keeping you all up to date. We hear you when you say you want more visibility and more communication and engagement with us. Ratique has been a forum moderator for pretty much as long as we've had a forum, and I honestly couldn't have asked for a better person to fulfill this role.
Lastly, I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy. The entire Tapas staff is sending you our best wishes. Ironically enough, this was the year we had set up more plans for more in-person meetings at conventions and at some of our office sites. Due to the situation - we'll be scrapping those plans in favor of some online activities - namely a fan-art contest due later in the year. So, please look forward to that!","[""Thank you so much Michael! This is really exciting! I've already been uploading my new book covers! I'm so excited to have them up and ready to go!"", 'So cool!

Given how this question was raised before, the topic of promotion is considered a hassle by many on the forums, and given the ability of muting it, that topic will inevitably become a dead category. Most don't go to promotion pages to read but showcase their work, and given how the forum will have the option to opt out of checking that place, the readership of many new creators will drop. Those who were checking it out by chance will have the opinion not to, which will decrease the exposure of an upcoming story. A creator will simply go and drop their post there, and that's it. \n It will be no different from those dead promo pages on inkitt and sites alike.\nWhat is the team doing to prevent that from happening?

28,Important Announcement Regarding Mature Content for iOS,Announcements,[],"Hello everyone, 
We’ve recently been contacted by Apple’s review team after one of their routine content audits. During their audit, they found a number of series they believe violate Apple’s internal safety guidelines (https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/128). We use similar wording in our own Content Policy Guidelines (https://help.tapas.io/hc/en-us/articles/11500532370786), and have always believed in contextualizing reports of mature scenes on Tapas. If the mature scenes in question contributed positively towards character or story development, then we felt those scenes were not in violation of either Tapas or Apple’s guidelines. 
As stewards of digital publishing, we find that it’s incredibly important to create a safe space for creators to freely express themselves creatively, to tell stories that you can’t find anywhere else, and to connect with readers from all around the world. 
The iOS version of the Tapas App has been age rated as 17+ due to the open publishing nature of our platform. We’re home to over 70,000 stories and among those a sizable portion contain an episode utilizing the mature filter. We felt that the 17+ rating was merited, and we always tried our best to curate and facilitate a safe reading experience by creating an opt in experience for reading any mature episodes. 
We’ve been servicing the Tapas App through the Apple App Store for the past 5 years, and have always complied and coordinated with creators for content policy guideline violations. We firmly believe that we’ve been interpreting and upholding the spirit of the policies in good faith, and that the works published by the Tapas community fell well within the boundaries of what was allowed by Apple’s policy. However, the severity in which they’ve interpreted their policies for this round of audits has forced Tapas to make some changes otherwise face removal from the App store entirely. 
We’ve tried to come up with more amicable solutions that wouldn’t negatively impact creators. We’ve been working around the clock and submitting a number of different iterations which were all unfortunately rejected by Apple. 
That being said, we will not be making changes or updates to our Content Policy Guidelines, and will continue to support creators who choose to create and publish mature works on Tapas. However, Tapas will be curating comics and novels in a different manner moving forward specifically for the iOS version of the Tapas app which will abide closer to the guidelines set forth by Apple. 
Series that have been flagged will not be searchable on the iOS version, but will remain accessible via the library if you were previously subscribed, or subscribe via the mobile web or web platform. Certain keywords and tags will also be inaccessible via search. All series will remain readily searchable and accessible on the mobile web and web platforms. We will not be editing or removing any flagged series from our services. 
We will be working with creators to ensure that they are given ample opportunities to make edits to their episodes if they wish to remain accessible on the iOS app. We’ll be sending out emails and notifications to all creators negatively impacted by these changes.
We hope that this change doesn’t deter healthy explorations of mature themes, and we deeply apologize for the inconvenience. 
Something that I’ve always loved about Tapas is that we’re a home for an incredibly diverse and wildly imaginative group of creators and world builders. We’re a home for stories that celebrate diversity, and speak truth to our everyday lives. Stories that aren’t afraid to open dialogue for challenging conversations, and to showcase mature themes through artistic endeavors. So while these changes may be intimidating, we remain committed to telling stories that you can’t find anywhere else. 
If you have any questions, I’m here to help.

I think censorship can be a dangerous thing and it puts a dent in freedom of expression. Like it was mentioned above, it blocks adults enjoying mature work by other adults. That said, I’m not sure I’ll be editing my flagged works to fit the policies to make them viewable because that would take away from me telling my story as I wished to tell it.

29,[Read before Posting] Forum Guidelines 2.0! (02.25.19),Announcements,[],"Hey hi hello! 
My name’s Michael Son, and I’m the Editor in Chief over at Tapas. I made a post regarding forum ground rules (link28) back in 2015, and thought it would be helpful to post an updated version of this guideline for newer members, and provide a refresher for some familiar faces. We'll also be updating our guidelines from time to time to better accommodate the growth of the forums (which, fun fact, has been visited more than 20 million times to date). 
At the heart of all of our guidelines and policies is an attempt to provide and maintain a welcoming, healthy, and creator-friendly culture. Tapas is home to over 40,000 creators and I'm incredibly proud of the positive attitude and commitment to helping one another that we've all fostered together. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 

1. There's Never a Wrong Time to be PoliteAlways be courteous to your fellow Tapas readers and creators. Don't forget that there is a real person behind every post, who, just like you, wants to be treated with respect and tolerance. Keep your cool even in the most heated discussions. Above all else, I want everyone to feel safe and welcomed in our forums. Any behavior that threatens the culture we've all helped to build will not be tolerated. 
We try our best to resolve issues behind the scenes by communicating directly with readers and creators. If you feel that there are posts that are actively hostile or are attempts to instigate any hostility, please flag those posts or get in touch with one of the moderators listed at the end. 
We operate with a two strike policy. First time offenders (depending on severity) will receive a temporary ban (typically lasting 3 to 7 days), and repeat offenders will receive a permanent ban. 
2. Tag, Search and Quote are Your FriendsI highly recommend trying to search for topics before creating a new topic (if you're asking a question, please search through the ""ANSWERED"" tag to check if it has been asked before). Be respectful of readers and creators, who have already created similar topics and have generated ongoing discussions. A great way to jump in an active topic is to quote an existing post or tagging someone already active in the topic to engage them. We want to reduce multiple topics dealing with the same issues to make the forums easier to navigate for everyone.
With the increase of readers and creators participating in the forums, we've noticed that there have been a considerable amount of similar topics being created. We'll be closing and unlisting similar topics on a regular basis to make the forums more organized and allowing for newer readers and creators to have an easier time finding topics relevant to their interests. 
Depending on the similarity between topics there may be instances where topics are unlisted rather than closed, if moderators feel that the level of discussion that have taken place merits ongoing responses. 
3. Do Not Solicit Sales on the ForumsPlease refrain from trying to make any form of sales on our forums. Link dumping to a kickstarter or store front without contributing to the betterment of the forum will not be tolerated. If you want to link to your kickstarter, storefront, etc then please make a topic that will help the community (whether it's things you've learned, or questions about how to improve). 
4. Report Posts When Necessary
In the past, we've encountered a number of spam bots, which prompted us to adopt a two-step authentication system for flagging posts, which means if two people were to flag a post, then the post will be placed under an interstitial visible only to moderators to either confirm or dismiss the flag. 
Beyond reporting, if you feel that a topic has escalated to a point where discussions are no longer healthy or a cause for concern, please tag one of the moderators listed at the end. Often times, a moderator will jump in and close the topic to try and deescalate the situation, then read through to try and contextualize the situation. Afterwards, we'll send out warnings or followups with the involved parties and either re-open the topic or permanently close and unlist the topic with a closing statement regarding why the decision was made. 
5. Categorize and title your topics appropriately 
Ratique covered this in her recent topic (link29) regarding making topic names that avoid ambiguity. With so many topics being created daily, it's important for topic titles to be clear and concise to help readers and creators navigate and find relevant topics more easily. Also, please try and utilize the Categories tool to help sort topics. 
6. Have FunThis might seem silly, but seriously, we want everyone here to be happy. This might be my personal tyrannical decree, but I really want everyone to want to be here. If you're not having fun on the forums, please think of why and what we can do to make it better. After that, I want you to reach out to me and we'll see what we can do to make things fun again.

And now, I want to introduce you all to some of the forum moderators!
@ratique has been a long time community forum moderator. If you've ever used the Tapas forum, you've probably seen her around! Not only is Ratique a beloved moderator, but she's also the creator of Devil's Acre (link6) and Queen of Gods (link3).   
@cain3 is a staff forum moderator, and also manager of the Help Desk section. Cain is incredibly knowledgable about Tapas and comic related publishing. Feel free to tag Cain in comic related creator questions.
@michaelson (me!) is a staff forum moderator, and Editor in Chief. If you have any questions pertaining to Tapas (company, policy, or content related questions) please feel free to tag me. 

Well, I hope that's been helpful and clears up some questions you might have had about the forums. 
As always, Tapas is a work in progress, and is constantly going through changes and improvements. If you have any suggestions for the forum policies and guidelines, please feel free to chime in and we'll be more than happy to consider it. 
Have fun, and see you around the forums.

30,Ink Support - Tapas Fee waived and update,Announcements,[],"Hey hi hello, 
With the recent success of the In This Together event (https://tapas.io/inthistogether7), along with the preparations for the revamp of the Tapas web experience (https://forums.tapas.io/t/site-update-website-change-notes/435695), we thought now would be a good time to clarify on and update the community on the Tapas Ink system. 
The Tapas Ink system (formally Coins) was initially designed around Premium (series with episodes behind a microtransaction paywall). Our goal was to introduce high quality stories with a low barrier to entry in order to promote sustainable forms of digital publication for both Tapas and the creators. It was incredibly important to us that we didn’t design a system that locked a reader out of the reading experience, but instead allowed for a variety of tools to help readers engage with creators in new and innovative ways (i.e. watch-to-earn video ads, install based campaign, surveys and more). To help ease readers into the idea of paying for digital stories, we designed the system around being able to run a number of different promotions, whether it was Ink sales, free Ink, gifted Ink, or earned Ink. 
While the system we designed has worked incredibly well, and has generated millions of dollars for creators taking part in the Premium program, it unfortunately was not designed around the Support Program. Transactional and conversion fees are applied when using Ink for the Support Program, which has led to some confusion for both creators and readers as to how much money will go into the pockets of artists they want to support. 
In order to alleviate the transactional fees incurred and in order to help creators take home as much money as possible, Tapas is waiving fees associated with the Support Program. This means Ink used to support creators will only incur the iOS, Android or web fees (if the Ink was gifted from Tapas or earned from watch-to-earn video ads, surveys, or generated from installing our partner apps, no fees will be applied). While the overall use of paid Ink for the Support Program represents a low percentage of Support transactions, we felt that upon further review the fee was no longer appropriate. And once the technology to circumvent our fees was developed for the In This Together event, we decided to implement it beyond the scope of the event. After some prep work and downtime, the Tapas fees should no longer appear on your transactional dashboard as of May 08, 2020. 
While Tapas will no longer be profiting from the Support Program, this in no way means that we will be discontinuing our efforts to run events or promotional campaigns to bring awareness to the program and its benefits to creators. Inksgiving will still be held, even though it will mean running at an operational deficit to the company, and we will continue to invest in improving the Support programs accessibility and functionality. We appreciate your patience regarding the feedback on this topic as we’ve explored a number of options and solutions. We’ll continue to reflect and brainstorm on other ways to bring more clarity and transparency to this system. 
Our goal is to continue to build more tools and opportunities for creators to succeed on Tapas and grow in our understanding of what exactly success means for each individual creator. We are and have always been committed to your continued success on Tapas. Thank you.

31,UPDATE | Honesty Policy,Announcements,[],"I do already thought of the problem of creators abusing the inks system long ago, but never thought that some will create hundreds of account to increase their sub size.

32,I want your Feedback: Collaboration Rules,Announcements,[],"Don't care for it honestly. It feels too much like a checklist. Yes most of these are best practice types of things but serious entities will do these anyway and others will just fade into obscurity.
This seems like the mods creating work for themselves. What does this actually add besides more overhead for the section? I don't mind suggesting these but actually enforcing them? Seems like pointless busywork, Tedious and Unnecessary.
It feels a bit like someone on the mod team (or more likely a manager) arbitrarily decided this was a problem and that they needed to do ""something"" this is ""something"" so why don't we do this?
I reminds me how my old boss INSISTED we update the lab machines monthly. Even though they were working fine and it was probably better to leave well enough alone. (if anything we were risking the new patches breaking things! We never had time to test ahead of time...)
This smacks of someone looking for a problem to solve, as if they're worried what people will think if they don't look busy.","[""You think it would help but really, it won't. It won't change anything it will just mean more work for the mods closing down these posts. If someone else wants to waste time helping the people who didn't put in the effort there is zero harm in letting them.\nAnd if anything the people complaining about bad collab posts are only wasting their own time. I mean they have no reason not to just scroll on. If you're not going to be helpful and just complain you should not be in the thread period.

If you're not interested scroll on, that's what I do.

Which would be far less work.', 'Definitely a positive move forward I think. But also second that there should be a prompt to a portfolio in the form as well!', 'I\'ve actually muted collab posts, so I don\'t actually see them.\nI only know what goes on when news hit me through friends of another ""oh the collab post drama again""', ""I think the list you have is a good starting point. It might dissuade those who haven't put that much thought into starting a collab from posting and possibly wasting someone's time. I think that's most people issue with some of the collab posts in the category; they feel like a waste of time even to just look at the post."", 'I think it\'s a good starting point, like other people have mentioned, to leave a form for people to actually form a pitch before they post so they don\'t just go ""hey I gotta great idea for a manga!"" Something that is needed is a requirement to show a sample of their previous work, let it be in writing or even a draft of a comic because there are far too many collabs that are so afraid of leaking their ideas that we can\'t actually form an opinion. People interested need to know what level the op is at and I think some people are hiding it by not showing any of their portfolio.\nAnd what may help as well is to give an explanation of how copyright works. Most of the collabs I see are about splitting profits but they make no mention of who owns what, or if they are allowed to do things off tapas with their artwork like make merch, post to other platforms, etc. This is basic stuff for illustrators but it feels like most people who are new to this don\'t know how to make a contract for that or that this is something they would have to even think about--that most illustration contracts for art actually have a limit to how long you can use it or what countries it\'s used in, etc. I\'m sure that for writers there\'s similar copyright issues they would run into as well, like as to if they still completely own their characters and story, and how much is the artist\'s and how much is the authors, and that if (it would never happen) but if they had someone else who wanted to buy the story for film or whatever, who owns it? Who are they buying it from?\nLike most collabs are younger people who are just starting out who just want to sandbox together a comic, but you gotta start learning about copyright at some point, and it\'s best to avoid confusion over who owns what when several artists and writers work on a project, and then one just decides to split. You have to know if they split, do they take their characters? Do they not?', 'Wait, you can do that? How??I mean i know you can mute posts individually but can you mute a whole category?', ""I'm not asking anyone sort the existing posts just make a new empty category for Pros going forward and leave the old one alone.\nI wouldn't waste time going back.\nJust make a new one with the new rules in place from the start and ensure everyone knows that's how its going to operate.\nI mean if these new rules go into the old category you'd either have to do the same thing or leave the old posts alone.\nI'd rather give people the option of using the more free-form category if they prefer or feel uncomfortable sharing details. (Sure you and I know there isn't any harm sharing ideas, but I think everyone is entitled to their view on that. I'm not sure I'd want to forbid collabs where they refuse to share details publicly.)\n Leave the pro section for the well organized and preferably paying.\nCastingCallClub does something similar for independent video productions.\nNow I'm currently right in the middle of a collab that came out of that section of the forum and its going fantastically and I know if these rules had been in place I might not have bothered posting it because at the time it was an undercooked idea I wasn't sure was worth developing. Still I found someone enthusiastic to work on it and through mutual trust and hard work we're very close to revealing something I'm damned proud of.\nIf my half-assed post had been shut down out the gate that one-shot would never have happened. It's why I'm taking this personally.\nIf that sort of semi-off-the-cuff idea pitching is no longer welcome in collab then I have little issue never using it again.

(Plus how much of a collaboration can it be if its that far along and key members are not on board yet?)\nBoth styles have their positives and pitfalls and doing both feels like a decent compromise.\nMaybe consider opening the new branch just as an experiment? see how they work alongside each other then re-evaluate."", ""I'd agree if it weren't for this line right here.\n\n\ncain3:\nWe will enforce this and any submission that doesn’t follow the basic structure, it will be automatically closed.\nEnforce was Cains word not mine.\nHave a space where these guideline are 'Enforced' and one where they are not. Once I have to worry about a 'guidelines enforcer' and have to dance around their approval then the pressure to have an answer to every question goes up considerably because its impossible to know where the line is. These guidelines are too broad so the safest course is to have all your ducks in a row because you don't wanna deal with the  'guidelines enforcer'\nI know I don't. Don't need the extra stress if I'm not 100% behind my idea.\nLet this be an opt-in program. Then nobody can complain if their post gets flagged\nLet me decide if my stupid idea is worth the extra effort and worry about having a mod picking over my pitch.\nBy the nature of these loose rules not even the mods know truely what the line is and my judgement and theirs are almost certainly not always going to match up.

35,Series level tagging and curation,Announcements,[],"Hey hi hello! 
Wanted to pop in the forums and talk a little bit about some gradual changes that will be coming to how we will try and better surface more relevant series to readers. 
So tags. 
It's been the topic of many discussions and has been something that our team has been wrapping our heads around for quite some time. As you might have noticed, we have various levels of tagging and indexing on Tapas. 
Okay, let me rewind. Indexing is how search works on Tapas - it's how our system takes a keyword and tries to look for it. There are a couple of key things that are currently indexed: Series Title, Series Tag, and Display Name. As we move forward, we want to try and index other areas such as Episode Tags, and potentially Series Descriptions. 
That being said, we're fully aware that due to the lack of functionality of the Episode Tags, creators have been utilizing it in a variety of different ways. We'll be working with creators to better educate them on how Episode Tags will be used in the future and how they can make the most out of it. 
With this move towards faster search and easier access, we've had to make the decision to blacklist certain keywords from being indexed. These keywords are primarily adult oriented. We'll be working with creators on giving them feedback on what alternative tags they'll be able to use. 
We've been experimenting with tag based curation for the past month on future builds of the app and have done smaller scale experiments on the front page of the current app. We'll be testing more tag based curating, one that we've been playing with is an open tag system where you'll be able to tag your episode with certain ""tags of the day"" (i.e. Caturday), and if your episode is relevant to the topic, it'll appear in a feed style page.

Not a huge stickler for most I assume, but it feels like a trap when I'm specifically wanting to be lazy and read a picture-book and not paragraphs and paragraphs of text. The same for if an item is complete or not. You're able to search for complete or not right now, but that search seems to take priority over other search items or terms you may have entered.\nOn the note of subs: most and least, I do not want to see Views or Hits or total view counts listed on the search.

Hey hi hello!
So, I actually sent this out via a creator newsletter last week but, jus tin case you didn't receive it, I wanted to post it here for posterity's sake. 
We’re excited to get in touch with you to talk about our upcoming event here at Tapas: Spring Inksgiving!!
As you may remember, Inksgiving is a fun filled, charitable event that encourages our community to show their appreciation to our amazing family of Tapas creators by supporting them with Ink and encouraging messages! And as a gift to everyone, after the event is over, everyone who supported a creator will receive a percentage of what they supported back!
Back in 2018 we had our first Inksgiving to reach a site wide goal of 10 million Ink supported and raised over 15 million which translates to $12,500.00 raised for creators in a 48 hour period! 
This year we will be setting our sights much higher with 20 million Ink as an overall goal. On the way we will have some milestones goals of 10M (10% Ink back), 15Mil (15% back) and 20Mil (20% back)! 
What can I do as a creator?

40,Retiring some Categories,Announcements,[],"Hey hi hello! 
You might have noticed that we’ve been making quite a few posts recently (updates to our forum policies (link3) as well as some fun community engagement initiatives (link7)). We hope to keep improving the experience on the forums, and while our forums continue to grow in the number of topics and posts, we need to place a stronger emphasis in organization and categorization to help newer and returning members participate in the conversation. 
One of the major changes that we’ll be implementing shortly will be retiring some categories. 
문의 - originally meant to be a watercooler area for Korean creators, it hasn’t seen a whole lot of use, so we’ve decided to retire it. 
Webtoon Live - we acquired a company called Webtoon Live years ago and this category was meant to give those readers and creators a place to chat and slowly integrate into the Tapas community.
Hot Topic and Cool Topic - I can’t really tell what the difference is between the two other than the fact that I used to shop at Hot Topic. So, we’ll retire both of these, bye! 
Super Science Club - under utilized category, I honestly wish I had more time to dedicate to talking about all the cool data driven stuff at Tapas. Apologies. 
While we’ll be retiring these categories, I also wanted to open up the floor to introducing some new categories. Both Misc and Uncategorized get a lot of usage every month, so we’re not covering a lot of the categories that people want to talk about. 
What categories would you like to see in the forums and why?","['I would love to see a role play category. It would encourage some creative writing and thinking with the other creators and honestly is a great way to blow off some steam sometimes!', '\n\nmichaelson:\nWebtoon Live - we acquired a company called Webtoon Live years ago and this category was meant to give those readers and creators a place to chat and slowly integrate into the Tapas community.\nI\'ve always thought this was a category for the Webtoons service by NAVER/LINE. I thought ""huh, kinda nice of them to offer a place for authors from other platforms a place to talk"".\nSo maybe a category I would like is one for alternative platforms maybe? Not just Webtoons, but others as well, all in one category.\nAs for why, it would just attract more authors to the platform.

Like if someone is asking for critique or reviews, do I put them in ""Intro | Feedback | Shoutout"" or ""Reviews""? Not really a new category but separating it into Into/Shoutout and Reviews/Feedback makes more sense to me. \nThe Art | Writing also seems to cover a whole variety of stuff, like asking for cameos, art/writing trades, posting progress, and asking for advice.

There aren't thaaaaat many people active on the forums so it might not be very useful (really specific questions involving more technical stuff might not get answered because, for example, there may just not be enough people on the forums for one of them to just-so-happen to be a professional armor-maker, for pigs or otherwise), but it could still be a nice place to try to work out kinks in plots!"", ""I am only speaking for myself here, but I'm thinking the Lounge Category should get cut also.

This will unavoidably seem like sour grapes on my part. The reason I and others lost our status as forum Regulars is because the system requires us (among other requirements) to read at least 25% of all posts. As some threads got popular and now produce 200 posts per day, I am basically just scrolling through pages and not reading them to fulfill that one requirement, and I don't even know how often the requirement is compiled. The system does not scale as the community grows, so eventually no one will be able to maintain the Regular status. Being a Regular does have a very few permission benefits which are entirely separate from the Lounge.

43,Tapas iOS App Issue,Announcements,[],"Hi everyone, 
Noticed a few topics regarding the status of our iOS app and wanted to jump in and clarify a few points. 
First off, thank you so much for your continued patience and support. We've been getting so many encouraging messages in support of Tapas, and we're working incredibly diligently to try and restore the status of our iOS App in a timely manner. 
I'd like to clarify right off the bat that our app was not taken down due to any mature or nsfw related reasons. We've gone to great lengths to work with creators to identify episodes or series that violate our content policy guidelines and help create amicable solutions to make sure that these series and episodes remain visible to readers while not jeopardizing the livelihood and opportunities of the creators that publish with us. 
I know that in light of the recent Tumblr debacle, there has been quite a lot of speculation that Tapas is currently being reviewed under similar scrutiny, but the reason why the iOS app was taken down was primarily related to how we structured reader sign-ups and Tapas Ink. 
For those that have used the Tapas App, you'll know that we have a fairly simple and easy to dismiss sign-up process when you first open the app. On top of that, we have a number of Premium Comic and Novel series promoted on the homepage which sometimes requires the use of Tapas Ink to access subsequent episodes. Apple viewed this process as being in violation of their app store guidelines which prohibits apps from requiring account sign ups to purchase (or use) Apple's In-App purchasing mechanics. They felt that the requirement of Tapas Ink to unlock episodes of Premium Series was in direct violation of this guideline. 
We've been coordinating with the Apple Team to help resolve this situation and have recently submitted a new version of the app that addresses their concerns. The recently submitted version of the app is currently under review.
We apologize for our lack of transparency during these past few days as we weren't certain the extent of details that we were allowed to divulge. 
Hopefully this clarifies the situation and alleviates some concerns in regards to Tapas' approach to mature content. 
In the meantime, iOS readers can still access the mobile version of Tapas by visiting m.tapas.io 
Thanks,-Michael and the Tapas Staff

Free-first access to creative content without an account/ink currency functionality is definitely a priority for userbase growth.\nAll creators greatly appreciate the varied audience this platform provides so hopefully this will establish a keener balance of ink-locked series and free-to-read series for the app in the future.', ""Glad to hear it wasn't about lewds.

45,New Android App Update (Beta),Announcements,[],"My fellow Tapastinauts,
We have a very special announcement to make.
We just released the beta version of our new Android app! 

0-Screenshot-DailySnack.png600x900 344 KB
 
Although this is a beta version, it will be a vast improvement for many of you who have used any previous versions of the Android app. So if you are the adventurous sort, have an Android phone, and want to take the new app for a spin, go download the update25 on Google Play. What are you waiting for, seriously? It’s awesome!
Just to give you all some background, over the past few months we’ve been building both our iPhone and Android apps from the ground up. This beta release of our new Android app is a huge milestone for us and we’re excited to share it with you. In the coming months, expect lots of exciting new updates for mobile. 
Keep in mind that this is a beta and there are still many features we want to add to our apps in the near future. But overall, we feel that this new update will make reading your favorite Tapastic comics on Android a great experience. iPhone users, stay tuned! We’re vigorously working on our new iPhone app. 
For those of you who install and use the new app, please let us know what you think. Your feedback is extremely valuable and will continue to help us make Tapastic the best it can be. Feel free to reply in this forum thread or message me on my wall4 with feedback and questions.
If you’ve made it this far, then you either don’t have an Android phone or you haven’t stopped reading this post to download the update25 yet. Go download it! 
Last, but not least, all of us here at Tapastic are extremely thankful to have such a fantastic community. We hope all of you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Enjoy the update! ","['Yes, yes!! I like it, it\'s way better than the last one. And I love the new icon I can finally see my profile and reply to messages, I can fave stuff and I didn\'t experience any bug so far (before, the app sometimes freezed and I had to restart it).But the best feature is the ""Daily Comic Snack""^^would be nice to see something like this for serial comics too.', ""That's great!But there is a bar (with the series' and episode's name) in front of the comic pages that cannot be removed nor hidden - and this is obstructing the reading experience.\n\ntapastic.png720x1280 701 KB\n \nFeatured in this screenshot is Ark by Hades"", '@brianorlando \nsome feedback:\n\nlove the new app! It\'s much cleaner and works well! I\'m excited to see it get even better! \nlove how the like, comment and share buttons are easy to locate and click on.\nI love how it\'s much easier to view the artist\'s profile and see their other series, will it ever be possible to view non-artist profiles from the comments?\ncan we please integrate the author\'s description/comment of the episode into the app somehow? like an extra \'button/pull up\'?\nthe link-outs from the profile descriptions don\'t show the \'name of the link\' but shows the entire HTML link. in this case, one of them looks like this: http://tapastic.com/browse/list?pageNumber=1&sortKind=RECENT&genreIds=&creator= instead of being ""Comic Feed"" which looks kind of ugly and weird.\nSome of us got the opportunity to make banners for their comics to help feature them. I haven\'t finished mine yet so I was wondering if you will be re-integrating that feature into the new app at all? \nI like the ""new+noteworthy/trending/top/collections"" page on the app but I feel like the one thing I liked about the old app was seeing a different comic featured quite prominently each time I opened the app so I could have something new to check out every now and then. I think because none of the \'main 4 tabs\' on top actually show banners for actual comics (barring the comic snack which long series can\'t get into) you\'re losing the opportunity to feature different comics upfront. \nThe icons for the comics are also kind of small. Instead of showing little tiny icon, with the name of the comic, number of subs/and last update info taking up most of the space, it would be aesthetically nicer to see the icons bigger, and tiled with white space between them. A bit like how the tapastic front page looks. The Title and sub (+) indicator can be below, the other information seems unnecessary especially to a new comic with few subscribers. Example below: \nThe ""comic snack"" is pretty cool, but I sort of wished it was optional. i should say these kinds of comics are nice but I don\'t want them to be the first things I see when I open the app.\n', ""I agree to everything mentioned above. The only different point is that I don't care viewing the Comic Snack  when I open the app. I think it's actually a good thing imo.\nAlso, that'd be good to see a Settings area in which the users could configure the notifications they'd receive. I've received a vibrating notification regarding a new Comic Snack but I'd like to be able to control that and decided whether or not to receive them, and how to receive them (sound, vibration, etc)."", ""Also note Android 5.0's new Material Design guidelines.Click Here8will make it look prettier"", ""little bug, I can't see the text in the comments section,I'm using a SGS3"", 'Thanks for all the feedback everyone!

That'd be good to access someone's page this way as well.\n"", ""\n\nguilhermecahu:\nIf I leave a comment in an episode and someone replies to that comment, I don't receive any notification in the app. That'd be good to have this kind of notification too.\nCurrently adding that in the next update.

Users also screamed about better ways to see whatever comics are most popular right this moment, Reddit-style. Think of the current Comics Snack view to be version 1.0, where there\'s only one type of feed item (editor\'s pick); eventually the feed can have multiple types of feed items. ', ""Is it possible to access the forums on the app? So far I've been opening the full site on my phone to check the forums every now and then."", 'Love the new app but for the last couple days whenever I tap the top menu selection to view my subscriptions, it gives me a message, ""Uh oh, something went wrong...""\nI\'m using an LG G2, let me know what other info I can provide.', 'The comic snack needs an ""on/off"" toggle. Another problem is that comics that haven\'t been updated in months show up before recently updated comics in the search, because they have more subscribers.']",12/23/2014 2:24

We’re excited to announce that our favorite community event is coming back as Inksgiving!

1080x1080[Inkshop-Announcement]-Inksgiving_cards-1.jpg540x540 56.5 KB

Inksgiving is going to be a 48-hour event dedicated to giving love and support to your favorite creators that will take place from Tuesday, November 20, 12:00 AM PST and end on Wednesday, November 21, 11:59 PM PST. 

3-inksgiving_resized.jpg540x540 58.5 KB

It’s easy as it looks! Fans buy ink from the Ink Shop and use it to support their favorite creators by going to the series and tapping on Support. Ink that was previously earned or earned during the event can also be used. Not seeing ink? Update your app today!

4-inksgiving_resized.jpg540x540 68.7 KB

During this 48-hour period, fans will be gifted back a percentage of their individual contribution of the ink they gave to creators. If we reach 5 million drops of ink, fans will receive 5% back, if we reach 10 million, fans will receive 15% back based on the amount they individually gave during the event. This year, the community goal is to hit 15 million drops of ink sent in support! If we achieve that goal, then fans will receive 25% of their contribution back. Fans will receive this gift after 30 days.

Creators! We hope you’ll help us in spreading the word about this great community event, either in the form of an episode explaining how to give support, a post on your creator wall, or through social media (#inksgiving). If you do happen to create an episode for the Support Program or the event, please send us a link over at priscillatov@tapasmedia.co! We’d love to include it in an upcoming collection to be featured on our mobile apps. We’re looking forward to seeing what support means to you!

Fans! To help you out during Inksgiving, we’ll be running a special discount on Ink Packs! For $4.99, fans will be given 1,000 more drops of ink than usual. So instead of receiving the standard 5000 drops of ink (which is 4,000 plus a 1,000 drops of ink bonus), fans will receive 6,000 drops of ink when they purchase this special pack during the event!

We'll be discussing our views on webcomics from both a platform and creator perspective, as well as some of the challenges we faced along the way and continue to face to this day.

50,Tapas Writers Camp Contest!,Announcements,[],"Hi everyone! We have an exciting announcement to make. 
On March 19th, creators will be able to participate in the first ever Tapas Writers Camp! 

WritersCamp-Logo.jpg800x450 149 KB

We wanted to show our novelists some love and give you all an opportunity to show off your creativity and talent while also helping you discover the works of other novelists on Tapas. To do this, we decided to put together a contest that will provide novelists a chance to compete to become one of the two Writers Camp finalists. Both finalists will be offered $1,000 and a Tapas Premium publishing deal.
What is Writers Camp?
Tapas Writers Camp is a month-long community event and competition that will take place from March 19th until April 19th. During this month, participants will publish their stories on Tapas with the tag #FirstWritersCamp in their series tags and submit them to the Tapas editorial team at writingcontest@tapasmedia.co. Participants are also encouraged to check out other submissions by searching for the ""FirstWritersCamp"" tag on Tapas and voting for their favorites in the ""FirstWritersCamp"" search tag by subscribing to them.
What kinds of stories can I submit?
For this round of the Tapas Writers Camp, we are open to receiving all kinds of novel submissions. There are no limits with regards to genre or writing style, so long as you submit prose and follow the other rules listed below.
We do ask that your submissions conform to our Terms of Service and our Content and Community Guidelines. It’s also a good idea to check out our recommendations regarding story and format. But aside from all that, feel free to submit whatever kind of story you want to write!
Can I submit more than one story?
Since we are planning on doing multiple Writers Camps throughout the year, we ask that you limit your number of submissions to one story. We are excited to read all that you have to offer, but we also want to be able to give everyone a fair shot, so save any other submissions you have for the next Writers Camp or for non-contest submissions.
What are the rules for participating in the contest?

The story you submit for the contest must be your own work.
The story you submit must not have been published elsewhere previously. In other words, it should be a new, previously unpublished work.
You must publish your story on Tapas within the submission period of March 19th to April 19th, 2018.
Your novel must have at least 10 episodes that are at least 500 words each by the end of the submission period. You do not have to submit a complete story by April 19th, but it’s important to keep in mind that if you submit and win, you will need to finish the story at some point! 
You must be 18 or older to submit. 
You must send a link to your new Tapas novel to writingcontest@tapasmedia.co

How will the winners be chosen?
There are going to be two winners. Each will be offered a Tapas publishing deal and will also receive $1,000 in prize money. 
One winner will be selected based on their story’s subscriber count. Whichever story has the highest number of subscribers will win one of the prize slots. Disclaimer: Quality is important for all submissions. Tapas reserves the right to select another winner in the event that the story with the highest number of subscribers is not qualified for any of the reasons listed above and/or does not meet our editorial standards. If a story that is not of the kind of quality that Tapas is interested in publishing is the top winner in this category, we will move on to the second most subscribed series.
The second winner will be chosen by the Tapas editorial team. Having a high subscriber count is great, but we will be reading submissions and searching for high-quality, entertaining stories that may have been overlooked by readers.
Can I still participate in Writers Camp even if I’m not going to officially submit?
Yes! If you are unable to participate in the contest due to age restrictions or other conflicts, we still encourage you to interact with the community during this time and put new content out there. Whether you’re submitting to the contest or not, you can still vote for all your favorite participating stories by subscribing to them and strengthen the Tapas novel-writing community by commenting on stories and giving constructive feedback.
I want to submit but I don’t know where to start! Do you have any suggestions?
We do have a few writing prompts for those of you who love to write but aren’t sure where to begin! Using these prompts is by no means a requirement. They’re just an extra creative nudge for those of you who need one.

One night, while the main character slept, everything went wrong. When they woke up, it was to a world entirely different from the one they’d always known. As they talk to others, they hear that there is a land across the sea that may hold the key to restoring life to the way it was before.
Two lovers meet in an intergalactic spaceport. They are supposed to head in opposite directions, but how are you supposed to try and make a relationship work across multiple galaxies?
All they ever wanted to know is the truth. Now they know how to get it, but they’ll have to fight the gods for it.

If you have any questions, please feel free to leave them below and we'll be more than happy to help!

51,Tapastic Update: Creator Notification Updates and More,Announcements,[],"Dearest Tapasticans,
We just launched some new updates! Without further ado, here they are:
Notify Subscribers After Editing an Episode
Creators will now be given the option to notify subscribers once they've edited or updated an existing episode.

send notifications.PNG1057x611 50.2 KB
 
After clicking send, all subscribers will see the update in their activity feed, not on their reading list. Many creators have been requesting this for some time, and we are excited to announce that it’s now live on Tapastic!  
Notify Subscribers on Your Profile Wall
Creators will now be able to simply toggle a Notify Subscribers button on their profile wall to share important updates, new projects, sketches and more.
 
When the notification button is toggled on, all subscribers will receive a notification on Tapastic. We hope creators will make good use of this to help stay in touch with their subscribers.
Other update notes:

Added forums link to the top navigation bar to make it easier to find
Fixed some bugs

On another note, if you have an Android device, be sure to download our new Android app12!  It’s free and full of comicy goodness. Although it’s still in beta mode, you’ll notice immediately that it’s a vast improvement from the older version. iPhone wielders, the iOS app is approaching. Keep your phone at the ready.

52,Updated Site + Terms and Services,Announcements,[],"Hello everyone! 
You might have noticed that the site has undergone quite a few cosmetic changes to match the apps recently. We hope to continue improving the site and bringing more of the usability of the apps to the desktop experience, closing the gap between the two. 
Daron has written up a great article over at Medium that details the changes which you can find here: http://bit.ly/2oPHq1F135
We've also updated our terms and services agreements (as well as our NSFW policy guidelines) which you can find here: https://help.tapas.io/hc/en-us/articles/115005324708-Updated-Terms-Policies-and-Guidelines402 Thanks to every creator that helped us forge the new guidelines! I know it was long overdue.
As with any launch, there are bound to hiccups (like this one: http://forums.tapastic.com/t/concerns-about-terms-of-service/17766/156), and we greatly appreciate everyone lending a helping hand in helping us find and correct any issues that may arise. 
Please note that there are a couple more changes to come to the front page, including surfacing more non-premium series, and making up our minds on which one to keep (staff picks vs new & noteworthy, they're the same thing...ish). Please bare with us while we listen to feedback and try our best to apply them to the site in pragmatic ways.","[""It will take some getting used to. And personally I think it's become less easy to go to the forum from the original webpage. But all in all change is necessary I suppose, and in only a matter of weeks the changes will be perceived as normal.\nI do wish however, that the activity message board was accessable on the mobile app too. It seems odd to me that the're only available through the browser version."", 'I  second what Blobsyoowhan said. I could not find the forums on the main site and had to google search to get access to them.', 'The link to the forum can be found at the bottom. Which is not an ideal place.', ""Thank you! Can't believe I didn't notice it."", ""We've been discussing some of the changes here57. Biggest problem seems to be with the readability of the font, the lack of accessibility to 'trending' and 'fresh' sections, and the forums' link moving to the bottom."", 'As a subscriber and supporter of many comics on Tapas(tic) I must say that the new ""In Library"" referring to a comic you are subscribed to feels very impersonal. This platform is amazing at establishing connections between creators and their followers. None of the other comic sites have this. The moment you hit subscribe on this site you show both your interes for the comic and your support for the author. Now, when you just add something ""In Library"" it kind of takes away from this connection and excludes the author. I know every now and then changes are necessary and I still think this platform is absolutely amazing, I just hope you will preserve the personal touch that made it so special.', 'Ahhh the new style is so ""bubbly"" it\'s doing a number on my eyes, gonna have to get used to that o.o', 'The site is updated and it is cool!', 'The message board must be accessible to the mobile site. (It takes a longer time for me to load the desktop version, so please, this feature must be included to mobile users)', 'My main problem is the fact that the homepage is very very busy now.There are way too much categories for me, I guess it\'s OK on the app because it\'s on a tiny screen, but here I feel lost and I feel like I have to scroll endlessly to get to the popular/trending/staff pick categories. I get that you want to put the premium comics and books first, and I don\'t have any problem with that, but I feel like it could be a bit lighter. Definitely, less categories in between would be nicer. And I wouldn\'t have found the button for the forum if I hadn\'t read the info here (I had to google ""tapastic forum"" to get here). That\'s it for now, the font seems good to me but I have a huge screen so that\'s probably why I can read it clearly ^3^\'', ""ah, now i know, why my dark Tapastic theme isn't working anymore ^^\nand that is also the biggest point from me... please give the site a dark theme... all the white is hurting my eyes in the nighti can get used to the rest, but not the white"", 'I\'m working on a more comprehensive review of the new layout rn, but so far, I think my biggest points for feedback are: \nThe appearance. Right now it feels like it\'s just the ""view desktop version"" version of the app, and parts of it really doesn\'t work. Two biggest examples are the front page as well as the dashboard. The dashboard is pretty cluttered right now IMO and just isn\'t as user-friendly as it used to be. It\'s almost like it\'s too much in too minimal of a space. One of Tapastic\'s greatest strengths has always been keeping things looking and operating as minimalist and simple as possible. So it\'s kind of an eyesore to see it cluttered with as much as it is. Front page. Premium comics, premium comics everywhere. I get it that you guys need to make money, but before the non-premium community members were ALREADY faced with enough competition as it is with the naturally-popular genres (ex. gag-a-day, BL, etc.) so now it feels like we\'ve been pushed back even further by being forced to the very bottom of the web page below comics that are ALREADY advertised literally EVERYWHERE on the app. Again, I get it you guys need to make money, but I feel like it\'s becoming too ""exclusive"" like places like Hiveworks, where you\'re either the ""popular"" kid or you\'re just a loser lol \nAnd what\'s going to become of the banner section? Is this just going to be premium comics/books all the time now? I always enjoyed finding new comics with the banner system before but in the past several months it\'s just turned into ads for premium comics which I have no intention of reading, as someone who doesn\'t really care for the coins+keys system (and honestly, I really don\'t enjoy many of the comics/books that were selected for premium... but that\'s just my personal taste lol) and having to pay to read comics (ironic considering I\'d love for people to do that for me xD but I don\'t force them behind a paywall either, if they want to read my content early they can pledge to my Patreon, otherwise they can just wait a few days lol... maybe that\'s why I\'ll never make a living off my work  ) \nThe way the front page is laid out now, I\'m almost preferring how Webtoons does it - a section for Featured, a section for Discover (their free to upload platform). That way the Discover section has its own methods of exposure, even if it\'s on a separate page, and doesn\'t have to directly compete with comics that are getting exposure just because they\'re contracted.\nA lot of links are broken like the Books page and some of the Publisher options, but I\'m betting that\'s going to be fixed soon if it hasn\'t already since the last time I checked  \nThat being said, I am glad to be seeing the tipping options and such come to the main site. That alone is a step in the right direction, it\'ll save me a lot of ""this version vs. that version"" explaining when I\'m talking to potential readers (because it turned a lot of people off from the idea before). Still, I feel like the desktop should have been optimized to work hand in hand with the app, but right now it feels like it\'s just a cookie cutter copy of the app, which is kinda disruptive to the desktop portion of the community. I mean, if you\'re gonna make the desktop version look just like the app, what\'s the point in having the desktop version? What\'s the point in having the app? But I get that this new layout is still like, BRAND new, and technical issues like broken links and such will be first priority, so I\'m looking forward to seeing how you optimize it in the future. This is still pretty new and there are gonna be bugs and necessary tune-ups lol\nEDIT: Also right now clicking on the Tapas logo in the top left corner takes me to the help page which is probably not what it\'s meant to be lol (and if it is .... wat)', '\n\nUzukiCheverie:\nFront page.

Thank you for this, I was hoping that the trending section might get a lot of boost up for us creators, since I feel like the site is even less creator-friendly than before.', ""It is hard for me to log in to the new site using the dekstop version of my phone, and I also find it harder to get noticed now since:\n\nThere is a lot of link to specific comics that are already in popular now it is redundant, and fresh/trending gets kick to the bottom where nobody scrolls down that far.\nOther ways to find new comics are via the forums, and I almost can't find the forum button on the front page.\n\nI feel like these changes makes those who aren't so hugely popular to gradually lose more.\nThe font is also harder to read on dekstop compared to mobile."", ""We are currently updating the fonts package to the website. \nThe spacing, line weights and overall rendering of the font will be updated to be more legible and easier on the eyes. \nThese changes will take place shortly. \nWe originally used FUNCTION PRO for a majority of the fonts on the site, but have decided to make the switch to QUICKSAND as it is easier on the eyes (when rendered correctly) and is dyslexia friendly. The current font package we deployed was optimized for mobile reading and thus had issues with properly rendering on the desktop. \n\nUzukiCheverie:EDIT: Also right now clicking on the Tapas logo in the top left corner takes me to the help page which is probably not what it's meant to be lol (and if it is .... wat)\nClicking on the Tapas logo in the help section will bring you to the main help page. This is sub-site that operates independently. We'll change the button to differentiate it's functionality in the future. \nRarek:and that is also the biggest point from me... please give the site a dark theme... all the white is hurting my eyes in the night\nHm, potentially. \nblop:My main problem is the fact that the homepage is very very busy now.\nAbsolutely, we will tweak and edit this as we go along to make sure there isn't too much going on."", '\n\nUzukiCheverie:\nFront page.

Clearly you don\'t concern about this. Why do you not like new and unpopular creators and keep burying them 6 feet under?', 'I\'d like to actually address this seeing as how my post was used in this reply. \nI highly doubt Michael or any of the staff are out to ""get"" the creators who aren\'t contracted. The harsh reality of it is that they\'re obviously going to advertise the creators that are contracted because these are the ones that are making money FOR Tapas. And as Tapastic gets bigger and bigger, it\'s harder for the staff to reach out to these smaller comics like they did in the past (I remember back in the days when Michael could keep up with the website with a reading list and even regularly comment on comics and such, but as the website and the brand has grown, obviously they\'re going to be held up with other things and not be able to be as community oriented as before). \nMy biggest issue with it is how it\'s now too much. I didn\'t mind it as much before when it was on the app, but I did sometimes find it annoying to always be seeing the ""DOWNLOAD THE APP"" banner on the front page along with series getting promoted via the Comic banner that you could only read on the add, among other things. Still, I could tolerate it. Now that the desktop site is virtually a copy-pasta of the app, it\'s just more ""DOWNLOAD THE APP DOWNLOAD THE APP READ THE PAID COMICS"" while the free platform comics struggle to stay afloat with very minimal exposure. That\'s why I rarely use the app - because there\'s just no way to find anything that ISN\'T pay-to-read (and as I said already, I really don\'t like a lot of the comics that are available through it. Many of them are the same ""style"" and it\'s just not my taste IMO). That\'s not necessarily an ""attack"" on indie creators who aren\'t contracted, it just hasn\'t struck a very good balance between the two and once again the app and the ""pay to read"" functions for comics that are only contracted with Tapastic are pushing everything else out of the way. \nRemember when we had the Support function that was available for everybody? I want to see that come back, or something similar. At the very least, see the locked episodes become available for more people to utilize in a more customizable way without having to be contracted (because that is NOT something to depend on getting, and by the looks of it, Tapastic has a very, VERY specific market, typically Korean-made drama webtoons and American gag strips). Yeah, it\'s still pay to read, but it\'s still OPTIONAL. Much like how people do it on Patreon (myself included) with the Support system back in the day it was like ""hey, read this update 3 days early if you pledge $1/month!"" It wasn\'t stuck behind a paywall forever. Hell, even Webtoons doesn\'t pay wall block their stuff (but... I mean, I don\'t know how they\'re even sustainable so... that\'s not really a fair comparison. I literally have no idea how they manage to stay afloat or how they even make money lol)\n**It should also be noted that Michael is the Editor-in-Chief for Tapas. While this isn\'t certainly a small position, he\'s definitely not the only one who determines how Tapas should be built and utilized. So like... don\'t blame him lol there\'s probably only so much he\'s actually allowed to say. Businesses can\'t be completely transparent, unfortunately, otherwise they\'d never get anything done lol\nEDIT because I feel this is SUPER IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SEE, STAFF. SERIOUSLY. I don\'t care if you reply really, I just need you to see it and know that it\'s been said.\nThe front page of Tapas, if I\'ve counted it fairly, has 13 divided sections dedicated to Premium and ""popular enough to be Premium"" series. Books, Premium comics, collection comics (all of which typically are premium), and just random banners you\'re showing off for the books and paid comics. Thirteen. THIRTEEN. Thirteen individual rows of premium app content that you have to pass by to get to Trending/Popular. \nTHIS IS TOO MUCH TAPAS. \nEven for the app this is a lot to scroll through! There has to be some way to condense those thirteen rows into ten, even 5-7. Again, I get that you want to show these series off, I get that you want to make money and use the most advertising space you can, but if that\'s the case, I reiterate - why even have the desktop version in the first place? Why even update it to make it look more like the app? Why not scrap the free posting platform altogether and just make it a VIP invite-only place like Hiveworks/the Featured section of Webtoons? Because that really feels like where it\'s headed right now lol  \nAt thirteen rows, it\'s not even a ""free series can\'t get exposure"" issue, it becomes a ""WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH ANYTHING HERE"" issue. It\'s so, so messy, and as I\'ve said tons of times already, it basically looks like you took the app and plopped it onto the desktop site, which just doesn\'t work for a webpage design. It\'s too much. Please. Please dial it back. I\'d love to see it for the sake of creators like myself and the people I work here with, but if you have to find a way to justify it for the sake of ""business"", even just for the sake of the website design, because right now, it\'s looking more cluttered than my medicine cabinet x_x\nThe team is super busy as it is and michael and the team sooorta need to sleep and it\'s currently 8 PM so like, their work day is undoubtedly done lol give them the typical 3-5 business days at the minimum ']",4/17/2017 17:27

55,OVER 7.8 Million coins tipped. A new record! Thanks to everyone who tipped their hearts out!,Announcements,[],"DECEMBER 22nd at 4PM PST
Make sure to mark down that date and time.
Why??
Because it's the start of our NEXT TIPPING EVENT!!
That's right!!: We're having another CRAZY Tapas Tipping Event that will run from December 22nd at 4PM (PST) until December 23rd at 4PM (PST)
AND: We're aiming for 10 MILLION coins tipped
AND: We will be awarding back to tippers a percentage of the coins they tip during the event no later than January 30th 2018 and the coins awarded back will also be TIPPABLE!!
AND: The breakdown of the percentage awarded back will be as follows:If 2 million or more coins are tipped during the tipping event we will award back 10% of the coins individuals tipped back to those individuals.
If 5 million or more coins are tipped during the tipping event we will award back 20% of the coins individuals tipped back to those individuals.
If we reach our goal of 10 million coins tipped during the tipping event we will award back 30% of the coins individuals tipped back to those individuals.
SO: If you're a creator who has tipping activated make sure to start screaming from the rooftops (figuratively people, figuratively) to get your readers all aware and ready to drop some serious coin your way starting December 22nd. And if you're a reader, there will be no better time to show those who work so hard bringing you their best just how much you appreciate what they do throughout the year.   
ALSO: Since our last tipping event back in July we've added ALL SORTS of new features that should easily make this our biggest tipping event ever! We've added tipping on the web, rewarded video on the web, and the new 2000 coin promo with MZ and Final Fantasy! 
SO: Lets all work together to give our favorite creators a holiday season they will NEVER FORGET!!

However anything else that is globally accessible on a casual everyday basis and helps cover ground that the bad ad-availability leaves bare in some regions, would probably be thankfully and lovingly received by the community at large. If Tapas has other ideas we would all love to see them in the future, and if any other creator and member has ideas that fit the customer demand I just described, I'm sure Tapas would love to hear your suggestions as well.\nBonus coins are great and all but as a creator who relies a lot on Tapas I would love to see more coin earning opportunities that don't come from tapas' own pockets be developed, since they help ensure financial stability and growth for my favorite site. I would hate to see Tapas get hit with an ad boycott like the one Youtube faced, especially since in their case it eventually turned into a form of discrimination against LGBT and Horror content (two of the most popular genres on tapas).

56,Dashboard update: revenue tab and balance details,Announcements,[],"We rolled out some updates to the Revenue tab and Balance details on the Creator Dashboard today, in order to reduce confusion and improve transparency. If you’re a creator enrolled in the Ad or Tipping revenue programs on Tapas, you’ll notice the changes the next time you check your balance. 
Want the tl;dr: highlights? 

We’ve updated what info is shown on the Revenue tab and Balance details pages to make your earnings and fees more clear, particularly for creators with revenue from tips.
Your share of ad revenue and tips remain unchanged. The Google, Apple, and Braintree/PayPal fees are the same as before, as is the share Tapas keeps.

Want more detail? Dive in below for a recap of the problems that motivated the update, or skip down to check out what’s new.

Previously, on Tapas…
Until today, we showed your “Current Balance” (the total current earnings before fees, including those less than 30 days old), alongside your “Available Balance” (the actual amount available to transfer to PayPal that day, after fees). 

old_balance.png760x440 26.5 KB

This worked okay for ad revenue, but once we added the Tipping program it made things a bit confusing due to a difference in the way fees were displayed.
Fees were calculated and shown for ad revenue each day, but for tip revenue fees were calculated for the total amount and only shown when requesting a transfer. This was due to the relatively low value of individual coins, along with the difference in potential fees depending on the source of coins used. Unfortunately, the end result was inconsistency and a lack of clarity.

old_details.png1896x944 80.4 KB

Some creators waited (and waited, and waited) for all of their Current Balance to become available, and were left wondering why some portion of their money appeared to be stuck in perpetual limbo… even after it was more than 30 days old. Since the Current Balance was shown before fees and the Available Balance was shown after fees, the tipping-related fees portion would always appear to be missing in a side by side comparison.
The amount earned and the fees taken were both correct, and there was nothing underhanded going on, it just wasn’t always exactly clear what was happening, or when.

What’s New
We’ve made several changes to the Revenue tab and Balance details to address the potential for confusion detailed above. 
On the Revenue tab of the Dashboard, the “Available” balance is the same as before, and still shows the earnings after fees available to request today. The “Current” balance has changed to “Pending,” and now shows the proceeds we estimate you will receive that are currently less than 30 days old (therefore, still pending). Just like the Available Balance, the Pending amount is shown after fees, which means what you see there will all eventually become available over time.

new_balance.png1080x456 34.8 KB

The Balance details page also received a tune up. Estimated fees are now shown for both ad and tip revenue, along with your estimated share of revenue each day. The (?) tooltips now provide more useful information, including a breakdown of the potential fees and share Tapas keeps.

new_details.png1896x944 83.5 KB

Revenue entries less than 30 days old are now marked as “pending,” so you won’t have to count backwards to figure out which days are available and which ones aren’t. Please note: the total Pending amount may not exactly equal the sum of the individual pending ad and tip revenue entries in the table, as your share and fees are only estimated for each row. The result is that some smaller values may appear slightly different due to rounding. 

We hope these updates make the revenue, balance, and fees on Tapas easier to understand, and give you a better overview of the money you’re earning.
Happy holidays!

Well, everyone likes free stuff right? So let's start with that.
Thanks to our friends over at NCSoft you can now earn 1000 Tapas Coins (the tippable kind even) by simply following the ad you can find after an episode of one of these2.8k comics on the app and downloading their new FREE game called ""Arami Puzzventure"". You don't even have to log into the game, just get to the login screen. 
Then go back to the Tapas app and you should see a pop-up with your 1000 shiny, new Tapas coins!
AND NEXT, for all you web-only folks out there, You can now buy Tapas coins and unlock premium episodes on THE WEB!! OMG!!!!!!
So yeah, those are some pretty big announcements that the Dev team deserves a lot of credit for. And thanks to them you should be seeing even MORE cool announcements verrrry soon (tipping on the web anyone??).

60,Tapas Novel Platform is open for business!,Announcements,[],"Hey creators!
By now, you may have noticed this shiny new button in your dashboard104.
That’s right! Now, you can publish written works on Tapas for free! 
Since this is all very new, you might have some questions, like:
Why did you add novels? I thought this was a comics site!
Though Tapas was originally a comics hosting site, we want to eventually serve bite-sized stories in all sorts of mediums, and give creatives more options to present their art, whether it be through illustration or the written word.
What kind of stories can I post?
Novels are held under the same standards as comics, so please be sure to check out the Content and Community Guidelines before you publish your story.
Can novels be monetized?
Yes! Like comics, you can activate Ad Revenue in your dashboard, as well as Tipping. However, some rules apply. To receive Ad Revenue and Tips:

You must be 18 years old or older.
Your cover thumbnail must belong to you or be copyright-free. This means no copyrighted images pulled from the internet. If you are not an artist, consider working with an artist from the forums or using a public domain/royalty free image from resources such as, Unsplash19, Kaboompics26, or Stocksnap18.
Your story must belong to you. Fanfiction cannot be monetized.
For Tipping, you must have at least one series with 5 episodes published. If your novel meets these requirements, please email Gabby at gabrielleluu@tapasmedia.co to activate Tipping.

Can I still apply to the Premium Program if I’ve already started posting for free?
Yes! As always, submissions are open for the Premium Coin-and-Key Program. Please note that stories and/or story pitches should be fully developed, so posting on the free platform first is a good way to get established before submitting for Premium.
To apply to the Premium Program, please fill out this form74.
What’s with the formatting options?/Can you add [feature]?
This is the very first version of the free novel publishing platform and far from the final product. We have plans to add more features in the future, such as more formatting options and ability to insert images, but for the time being, please send any feedback to feedback@tapas.io.
If you have further questions about the free novel publishing platform, email Gabby at gabrielleluu@tapasmedia.co.
So what’re you waiting for? Publish your first Tapas novel today!104
[EDIT: 6/5/17]

With the new iOS and Android updates, we've fixed a few bugs on the novel side, including:

Special character recognition for the app (text copied from word processors, curly quotes, accent marks, etc.)
Thumbnails on Android

61,iOS Offline Reading and Feedback,Announcements,[],"Hello everyone!
We just rolled out Offline Reading for iOS for everyone to test to see how they like it. 
When we first released (back in the old days) the Tapastic mobile apps, a huge barrier for us was that not many people had mobile devices, and those that did relied very heavily on WiFi enabled connections because data was not only really expensive, but fairly limited. Cut to today, where a lot more people have access to mobile devices, but the whole data problem hasn't really been addressed. 
When we transitioned to Tapas, we wanted to be mindful of data usage and if you've ever used any type of image based mobile app (i.e. tumblr, instagram, etc), you'll notice that those apps are very data intensive. 

IMG_3498.jpg2414x1412 972 KB

You'll be able to download episodes by clicking on the download icon on the far right of each episode. Your Library will now include a Downloads section specifically for these episodes.
Offline Reading allows for readers to download episodes ahead of time while on WiFi to read during morning commutes, train rides, plane flights, etc. Downloaded episodes will automatically be removed in 30 days, or you can manually remove them yourself. 
This feature will also be available on Android in the near future. 
We're currently gathering feedback and suggestions on how to improve the Offline Reading experience. Please leave comments below or e-mail them directly to me at michaelson@tapasmedia.co

64,The Future of Tapastic,Announcements,[],"All of us, creators, engineers, designers, editors, and readers are in a unique position at Tapastic. We are stewards of a burgeoning industry that has yet to truly define itself. When we first started, the status quo to which we held all platforms was simply free hosting. Together, we’ve come to redefine what we should expect from webcomic platforms.
We’ve come a very, very long way. A few years ago we started with less than a handful of creators. Today, our community is 8,500+ creators strong, with over 175,000 individual episodes uploaded. We’ve gone through several site overhauls comprising thousands of individual items designed and built from the ground up. Like I said, we’ve come a very, very long way. 
But it’s not enough. Not nearly enough. And while that might seem daunting to some, it’s deeply inspiring and humbling for us. We’ve come a long way, but we’ve got a lot further to go. And we’ll do it as we always have: together. 
Today we’re announcing there will be some radically innovative changes to the mobile apps over the next few months, as well as some site updates to help support those changes. 
The mobile apps have always provided a unique and separate experience than the desktop version of Tapastic. This has always been by design. We wanted to take risks with our apps - to test out new methods of content delivery and promote a wider variety of genres and creators.
While we’ve seen a great deal of success on our mobile apps, we recognize the need to keep innovating and disrupting the status quo. 
In the coming months, we’ll be releasing a big update to our mobile apps. The main shift will be our focus on creating a sustainable marketplace for content creators that is highly interactive with the reader. A brand new business model geared towards selling and distributing bite sized content in a unique way. 
The introduction of this new business model provides the perfect opportunity to collaborate with major publishers in order to deliver more high quality content. These discussions inspired us to introduce an additional category of content: novels.
Novels and comics will appear in separate sections of the mobile app, and will allow us to market ourselves to a brand new demographic while also helping to bring webcomics to a wider audience. Novels will be the first of many new offerings we’re considering to help diversify and enrich our overall content library.
With these radical changes to our apps, we’ll have to make some compromises to the desktop version of Tapastic. Namely, we’re discontinuing the Tapastic Support Program. The program has been in beta for the better part of the past year with numerous revisions and updates. 
Our decision to discontinue the program is due to providing our new business model with the best possible chance of success. Our Support Program relied predominantly on the current credit system, which conflicts with the new infrastructure required for future builds of the app. We want to begin utilizing Apple and Google’s in-app purchasing mechanics to improve overall user experience. 
With that being said, we encourage all of our creators to use Patreon. The fine folks there are building a fantastic service that we believe can work in tandem with Tapastic. We’ll make it easy for creators to promote an external crowdfunding campaign right on their episode page. We still believe that crowdfunding and community building are foundational elements of any creator’s career. 
Beyond that, the desktop version of Tapastic will remain everything we know and love. 
Please stay tuned as we will be announcing more news regarding what the transitional period of the Tapastic Support Program will look like, as well as more updates on the next generation of our mobile apps.

I assume these are literally text only stories of a minimum length, but I wanted to confirm.', ""So if I want to continue doing early release for supporters, I'll have to mirror on Patreon?"", ""I must say I would REALLY miss the Support Program. Setting Patreon is a heck lot of work in order to make it decent and I firmly believe that most of my Supporters would not follow me there because people don't like migrating. The SP is really one of the BIG things that made Tapastic so appealing, and I've always mentioned it to other comic artists as an argument to come on Tapastic (I'm so eager about the site that I've often been asked if I was paid to promote you guys xD).\nThe awesome thing with SP is that it's easy to set up and all in one place. You mention tandem with Patreon, but would that mean actual partnership with Patreon gateway built in Tapastic (and vice versa to invite other Patreon comic artist to publish here) or would it be like parallel bicycles driving in the same direction and waving at each other?I would be quite peeved to have to be on two platforms at the same time, unless there's a big benefit to it."", 'Will adding novels have chapter by chapter functionality for spaced out releases or will they have to be released all in one? Also are these like e-books that are purchased through you guys but readable on whatever e-book platform or will it only be through Tapastic? Also Also SUPPORT PROGRAM NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.', ""Sad about the support program! I've been really looking forward to getting involved in that. Just wanted to repeat @noxfox's question about whether other crowdfunding sources will be integrated - they're right about it being a pain to migrate! The support program really was one of the (many) great things about Tapastic."", ""Also we really need to know what other monetizing opportunities you're thinking about, because that will clearly impact the way we have to adapt ourselves to this new business model. For now it's kinda scary to think we might be loosing our primary source of monetization without knowing what we may get to replace it (Patreon doesn't sound like a proper replacement because it implies effort, and if we wanted to be there, we could already be there --some of us yet have accounts on both Tapastic and Patreon, and will lose money by loosing SP).\n...And Patreon isn't geared toward comics. It's like dA. Have you tried putting prose on dA? Nobody gives a fuck about it because dA is all about visual art, really. No picture, no damn to give. From what I've heard, it's pretty much the same on Patreon. There are so many different types of content that you can't target a specific audience as easily as you can on Tapastic. Here everybody's in for the comics, we know what we get to find. Networking and marketing ourselves on Patreon would be much harder because we'd be lost among unrelated offers and entertainments media. The only way it can work is if Patreon were to create a dedicated service for comics.And I personally find their graphic style to be really ugly, this orange and the fonts are so retro 70s and aggressive :/"", ""I have to say I too am quite sad about the support program being axed. Hopefully whatever comes after will help us creators in a similar way? I use Patreon, but it is a lot of hard work and effort, and takes up most of my time...they also take a prett ybig cut, something I was making up for with my tapastic support. : ( I also have a lot of locked episodes reserved for supporters (and Patreon) only. I will probably have to delete those....the ad revenue is nice, but not nearly enough to make a difference sadly.My favourite part about the tapastic support program was also, how automated it was. Patreon keeps having troubles with payments being denied or failing or errors etc, to a point, where I am missing a minimum of $100 per month on top of fees being taken out. I had to manually remove people who didn't pay for months, etc. Here, I never had to worry. \nWhatever you have planned, I am looking forward to seeing what it is at least. Been really enjoying my time here and hope it will still be worthwhile for me financially in the end..."", ""And there is a strong difference between Patreon and Tapastic's SP. In SP, supporters earn rewards by accumulating support, while in Patreon people receive rewards by their monthly contribuition, so no matter if you support someone there with $1 for 10 months, you'll never receive the reward of someone that supports with $10 on the first month. I can even remember it being stated on Tapastic's site that you guys found the SP fairer than Patreon."", ""Novels, eh?I've had such terrible luck with my series Legend of John the Parakeet as a comic on here that I may as well wait until novels (if what I'm thinking is correct about them) become available to post here and revise the original novel version of it I wrote a long time ago and put that up instead.Maybe I'd have better luck with it in a novel format instead of a comic."", ""Well. I had actually applied to the support program just 2 days ago, so I'm glad I read this when I did. will we just have to resort to things like Patreon?"", 'Thanks for the input so far. Yeah  I know you guys have a lot of concerns. First of all, consider this to be a ""heads up"" announcement; it will take at least some months for us to start seeing changes, so it\'s not like something is changing right tomorrow. Also, @michaelson and I are thinking about hosting a live stream event to address this plan in person and also take additional questions, please stay tuned for additional announcements.', ""I am sad to see the support program go away, but I'm excited to see the direction Tapastic is heading in the coming months!"", ""But the support program was what I liked about TaptasticI'm really glad about the novel feature coming soon, but please don't remove the option to support artists financially directly on this website. Now there doesn't seem much point to me posting my comics on here. The support option was so much easier for me than Patreon. What about the credit still yet to go out in the next month? Please tell me it still will because otherwise I want my money back so I can send it to the artists I want to support in another way instead."", ""Sad, just earlier today even I was flirting with the possibility of finally joining the support program. A shame. With Patreon's clunkiness, security and payment issues I am crestfallen that the support program must leave.\nI hope we still get to keep the ad revenue program, so I can pretend I make some semblance of money off of 8 hours worth of drawing a page.\nI also hope the future of Tap is a good one."", ""Shouldn't the support system be kept at least till something in site can replace it? And as Mikiko mentioned what would happen to the support episodes? \nI know it doesn't affect me, but it affects a good 60+% of the site."", 'Mmm, professional-speak.

I\'d appreciate not getting an alert every day at 3pm then.\nEDIT Actually I know it will be several months but should I tell my single supporter that he can stop?

But just because the Tapastic app will be turning into Tapas soon, that doesn't mean we've forgotten about our current Tapastic app users. We haven't. And to prove it we're announcing a special thank  you gift to everyone who has supported the Tapastic app over the years and has it installed the day we make the big switch.And that gift is...   600 Free Tapas Coins!!
Now you may be asking yourselves, ""Tapas Coins? What are those""? And that would be a very good question.The answer being that Tapas Coins are the currency of Tapas. They will be used to purchase Keys that unlock premium content. And now everyone who has the Tapastic app installed on their phone before the update (tentatively scheduled for Feb 29th) will be getting 600 of them for free!
So, for those of you who have been on the fence about installing the Tapastic app, or those who have friends and family who might like Tapas when it comes out. Go install the Tapastic app RIGHT NOW and make sure they do too!
But that only answers one question when we're pretty sure there's bound to be plenty more. So to that end we're also announcing a new livestream AMA with our CEO, Chang Kim and Michael Son, the Editor-in-Chief of Tapastic. This AMA will take place on Tuesday Feb 16th at 5pm PDT and will be hosted over at https://picarto.tv/Tapastic118. We are also taking questions beforehand from people who use this link65.
If you can make it on Tuesday we'd love to see you. But if you can't and still have questions that's ok too. Just use the link to ask your questions and we'll make sure Chang and Michael answer them. Then we'll repost the live stream so you can get your answers. 
Thanks and hope see you Tuesday,Team Tapas","['wooo. but how can you know that we installed it?', 'Tapas coins make the world go round!

Can we use Coins to support our fav artists?', ""The least expensive Coin purchase option will be 5000 Coins for $4.99. However from there, the more Coins you buy the bigger discount you'll get. \nFrom the start, Tapas Media's mission has always been about supporting other creators and giving people of all skill levels and experience ways to help support themselves...and Tapas has a lot of things planned for that. \nBut the best way we'll have at launch is for people to buy at least $4.99 of Coins and spend them on Keys to unlock the premium content of their favorite creators. That will be the easiest and most effective way.\nThis will help your favorite artists in the most direct way possible because Tapas Media will pay artists and authors in the Key program based on the number of Keys purchased for their content each month.\nYou can kind of think of it like this: The more Coins you buy the more you support Tapas Media and our ability to keep doing what we're doing. The more Keys you buy with those Coins the more you're supporting the specific creators whose Keys you buy.\nAnd for those who don't have extra money to spend we'll have a way they can earn Coins too! This will be done by having an option to watch a video ad and earn Coins right away. The video ad views don't pay all that much so viewers will most likely get 10 or 20 Coins per view, but it was important to us to be able to find a way for everyone to be able to get at least some Coins."", ""is this the 'new' support program, in a sense? will creators benifit?More importantly, where is the livestream reposted so I can watch it?"", 'Yep.

As a newer member of the community, it was also great to put some faces to names. I like that Tapastic is working towards a model that's so focused on the mobile experience. I was still left with a couple of questions at the end of it, though -- maybe because I just failed to understand the new systems. Sorry if I'm being dense.  \n@STAFF Will the new Key program be open to all creators as a means to supplement earnings from their work?\nOr, will creators have to apply to the program and be selected over their peers? If so, would Tapastic be basing their selections purely on the quality of the work being submitted, or will longevity in the Tapastic community and that creator's subscriber following be a large part of the consideration?\nAs a guy who is trying to invest capital into working with artists for collaboration on creating stories for Tapastic (a community that I've quickly come to quickly love), I feel torn. If I want to create a mobile scrolling (vertical) comic book, I feel that it'd be smart to monetize through the Tapastic/Tapas app/site itself. If that's not possible, then that means using Patreon or another off-site monetization system, which would likely push me towards a more western page-based comic book design over the vertical design. Knowing the answers to the questions above will totally inform how I approach the writing and art and design of my new projects.\nThanks!!"", ""donathinfrye:@STAFF Will the new Key program be open to all creators as a means to supplement earnings from their work?\nHi Donathinfrye! \nUnfortunately, we won't be able to open the program to every creator, however, we will make our best efforts to work with as many creators as possible. \ndonathinfrye:Or, will creators have to apply to the program and be selected over their peers?

70,Recent Issues with Spam on Tapastic,Announcements,[],"As some of you may know, there has been a recent influx of spam on Tapastic. 
If you thought the great Babaji Invasion of 2015 was bad, this one is much, much worse. 
These are some of the things that come with the territory of having an open publishing platform like Tapastic. Early yesterday afternoon, it came to our attention that there were a handful of series that were making their way onto the Fresh section that seemed ""suspicious."" 
Most of these series were linking to streaming sites for illegally pirated movies and/or links to cheat codes for various mobile games. 
Why these people chose to run scripts to generate these series on Tapastic is beyond me, but what started off as a handful of series, quickly escalated to 300. This morning 500. 
The one reality that I have to face as editor in chief, is that the people that are doing this have much, much more time on their hands than we do. 
So far, we've done our best to mitigate the problem by outright deleting these series, and removing the accounts. However, the speed in which we do this is limited and there are going to be times when one of these malicious series pops up on the fresh section, escaping our editorial staff's detection. 
And so, I'm asking all of us to keep an eye out for them. Use the report function liberally. 
My fear is that, the Fresh section will lose it's functionality if it's clogged with these series, and it gives an overall bad experience to new and returning readers and creators on the site. The Fresh section, admittedly, is not the greatest way to discover new creators and series, and we are working on better mechanics to help surface more series on a regular basis, but at it's current state is very vulnerable to these types of spam attacks. Yesterday night, there was a point where a few pages were comprised only of these spam series. 
While we're manually taking care of the problem for now, we are actively working on longer term solutions to help mitigate this problem. 
From the great Babaji Invasion of 2015 to the onslaught of the ""yet to be coined name for the [ON ' AIR]"" spam (I'll open it up to the community to come up with something catchy to call this). It's become quite apparent, that there will always be some type of annoyance we've yet to face on the horizon, but I am incredibly grateful that we have this community with us to face it together. We've gotten so many reports to help us stave off this most recent threat, and it really is going to be a community effort to help each other out. 
We get a lot of topics created here on the forum and a lot of e-mails sent to us asking how exactly we've been able to keep the community so  nice. There's no real secret sauce to it - it boils down to something really, really simple: everyone here is genuinely nice. And the staff will stop at nothing to help protect it. 
I will keep everyone updated on the on going status of events!

71,[update 05.10.16] forum log-in + ad revenue,Announcements,[],"Hello, 
While the forums appear to be back online and a lot of people are creating topics and commenting, there are still portions of forums that are still under construction - namely the log-in credentials verification process. Basically, if you WERE a member of the forums previously before the recent server migration and your log-in credentials were stored in the cache of your browser, you're able to still log-in and have full use of the forums. 
Unfortunately, for those that do not have those log-in credentials stored or just signed-up for a Tapastic account recently, that means you won't be able to log-in into the forums :/ 
We are currently aware of this bug, and are actively working on fixing this issue. 
Right now, our main focus is our maintenance update on our ad revenue program. We haven't been serving ads since the server migration, and are currently hard at work - expect the ad revenue program to make it's return sometime early next week.

Thanks for all the thoughtful comments on our last announcement263. We've been reading all the comments, and your feedback has been really, really helpful. Our team has been discussing the next steps for the Tapastic Support Program, and here are some more updates. 

We now have a timeline for the Tapastic Support Program: TSP will be discontinued on November 30, 2015 (PST). Why that date? We're planning to start testing the backend infrastructure for the new business model in December, and doing so without any possible conflicts or model clashes on the live Tapastic service requires discontinuing the Support Program before that. After November 30, the Tapastic Support feature will no longer exist on Tapastic.com.  
As a way to help creators promote their crowdfunding/patronage programs, such as Patreon (or Kickstarter or Indiegogo or any other site), we launched a new feature that allows creators to link the top series banner to an external site (see the screen capture at the bottom of this post). This feature is available right now, and of course you can link to any site, not just crowdfunding ones, if you want. 
After the Support program ends, all Supporter-only comics and posts will be changed to ""public"" (i.e. unlocked). Please make sure and see if there are any Supporter-only comics or posts that you don't want to become public, and delete or edit those posts before November 30. 
Any unused credits remaining in someone's Tapastic Wallet after the Support program ends will be refunded  in full.  
We will let individual creators make their own decisions on how to handle remaining milestone rewards for their supporters. For example, if a supporter has $x remaining to unlock the next milestone, the creator could encourage the supporter to adjust her support amount in order to successfully reach the desired reward following her November payment. If you're interested in pursuing this approach, monthly support amounts should be changed before November 1, as each supporter's individual payment is processed on a different day of the month (depending on when they first became a supporter).
We will not add any new creators to the Support Program, given that the Program will soon be discontinued. 
When we discontinue the Support Program, we will export supporter data and send that data to creators via email, to help creators manage and track their previous supporters more easily (to fulfill rewards or carry over status, for example). 
We will soon make an announcement related to the Support Program to supporters (we've only made announcements to the ""creators"" so far), via email and Tapastic notification . 

Please feel free to use this thread to post your questions, and we'll do our best to address them as quickly as possible. 
While we make our best effort to be as transparent and communicative as possible, it's simply impossible to share everything going on our office with you  - our internal discussions and debates, our thought processes, our hallway chats, our conversations with advisors and investors, etc. We wish we could take a long walk with all 9,000 creators!  But because that's not possible, we'll try our best to keep you in the loop in other ways, this post being one of them. Please stay tuned.

 Attention Tapastic Readers!
With the new year fast approaching, we wanted to take a quick second to do a few things before 2015 is in the history books. 
First, we wanted to say ""Hi. How's it going? Nice sweater!"" Second, we want to let everyone in on some exciting changes happening with the Tapastic mobile app in 2016.  
As some of you may know, we've been planning some pretty big changes to our mobile app for a few months now. We had an AMA back in October to sort of lay the groundwork for our plans, and even before then we were talking to creators and sharing our thoughts. 
The reason for the upcoming changes is pretty straightforward. As the world moves more and more towards mobile, we realized a great opportunity to do even more of what we love: provide the best platform possible for storytellers to do their thing. 
So what exactly will be different? When is this all happening? Well, early next year the Tapastic app will update and switch over to an app called Tapas. The Tapas app will have a new look and feel and will give our readers the ability to access not only the stories they know and love from Tapastic, but also new stories in the form of novels, short stories, and even scripts!  
Tapas will also give readers new ways to help support their favorite creators. One way readers will be able to do this is by purchasing keys to unlock creator-defined content. Another way will be viewing ads interspersed between episodes for creators in the Ad Revenue Program. 
Now obviously with news like this we can’t cover every detail in a single announcement. But rest assured that as we get closer to the switchover we’ll be giving plenty of updates and opportunities for dialog.         
Thanks and have a great holiday season,
Team Tapas","[""Several questions:\n\nWhy are you shortening the name?

It's nice to see everything has been going so well for you guys\nJJ\n \n\nHey JJ, thanks for the comment. Great questions. Here's a first pass at some answers. \n -Why are you shortening the name? (Legal reasons or preferences?) - It's just a preference. Trying to simplify things a bit and have it align more closely with the name of the company, Tapas Media.\n-Will this key thing be explained more later on? - Absolutely. It'll be explained in the app for sure but even before the app switches over we plan on doing another AMA as well as a few tutorials. But overall it's pretty straightforward. The Key thing is basically a way for premium creators to be supported. For readers interested in supporting creators, they would purchase (or earn) Coins. Then, if they came across a premium series or novel they would use those Coins to buy story-specific Keys that unlock episodes. Again, we're going to make sure this is all crystal clear before the app switches over, but that's pretty much it in a nutshell. Also, one super important thing to note is that the Tapastic website is staying exactly the way it is now and your ability to view Tapastic comics on the app will not change (you will not need Keys for that).     \n-Will the desktop website still be available as an alternative, and also include the novels, etc.? - Yes, the website will still be available but the novels, short stories, and illustrated scripts will only be available on mobile.\n-How will the app benefit creators? Or is the desktop website more preferable on that end? - The app will benefit creators by giving them what we believe to be a fresh approach towards being financially supported (if that's something they're interested in and we feel it's a good fit). But also, in our attempt to broaden the Tapas app's audience with written stories, we believe we can increase exposure for all Tapastic/Tapas comic creators as well.          \n-How will these changes, overall, benefit the creators as well as the readers? - We think the creators will benefit primarily for the reasons above. As for readers, there are at least three reasons. One, the app is actually pretty unique and fun to use. The development and design teams have been hard at work on it for over 6 months now and we can't wait to show everyone more when the time is right. Two, it gives readers access to more types of stories. Have you ever heard of illustrated scripts from TV shows that never quite made it on the air? We hadn't either. But since that sounded kind of interesting we decided to give it a try and create a few. And three, we know how supportive the Tapastic reader community can be. Generally speaking they really want to support their favorite creators in every way possible and with the new app that should be easier than ever."", ""Hmm, the key thing is actually pretty interesting.

"", 'I\'ve also been wondering about something that was touched upon ages ago, which was a preview option of the mobile version of what the comic will look like after uploading. There\'s already a ""preview"" button, but that just leads to the desktop version. Are there any plans for the mobile preview option in the future or has it been long forgotten?\nI think it would be a nice feature to add in since the new audience is mainly coming through mobile, so having a preview of how it would look (since the resolution is often lowered) beforehand would be a good preparation.\nAnother thing I would love to see is more of a creator side of the app, meaning certain options that can allow us creators to see stats, pre-locked episodes that we uploaded, and of course, notifications. The mobile app does have a little bit of that, since we can have instant access to our comic with a push of a button, but it treats us like we\'re just a normal reader, rather than the creator like on the desktop version.\nThirdly I am still angsty about there not being a desktop version for the novel section. However, I can understand that reading novels and stuff on mobile is much easier and has a much bigger market.\nAlso, I hope there\'s an option for profile changing on the app, such as profile pic uploading or description changing.\nKind of a side note, since the app is available on iOS and Android, wouldn\'t it be interesting to have it hit the Kindle or reading tablet market, especially with the new novel section coming up. Just a thought.', ""Hi ! I was wondering if there will be upgrading on the app regarding posting comments, notifications, private messages, etc....Because as a reader and a creator, I find the desktop version way better for that, I feel like the app is not convenient at all to read comments and participate to a discussion, and I think the main quality of tapastic is that it's a way to communicate more with your readers or other creators.Also the question have already been asked but will you do a livestream soon?"", ""im glad that you guys have sorted out what to do for the tapastic app,  i don't much fancy the tapas app because i feel like there are a lot of stuff missing in the app, creator wise. so i do hope the new tapas app can change that for the better.\nbut with all this going on, i do have my concerns for the support of the desktop version of the website. it seems that most of the focus is heading on towards the app that i feel like the website version is becoming less important.  i just have to ask, will the website be getting any attention too now that tapas is seeming to become the front end of tapastic?"", ""being able to add written content really does sound interesting.  Like a fun way to upload shorts for a main series if people have the time.  \nHowever I am curious about the messaging on that system too.  Honestly the desktop verison is easier to use when you want to chat, or just respond to comments in general or even post on your profile.  I understand it's a lot to ask for but I really hope we get something a bit easier to use on mobile."", '""Coins"" and ""keys"". Those terms associated to a BUSINESS platform sounds... Uhh... Like a game?.  I expected Tapas to be just a lot more developed version of the current app and to add more features from the desktop version in means of editing your content.\nIt will definitely be interesting, hoping it\'ll be as available and as catching of a system as the previous support-system was. STILL kind of cynical about this whole focusing ONLY on mobiles in the future  -idea. Of course mobile-entertainment is a major part of the future, but computers have and will for a long time to be the real professional tools.\nManaging a webcomic from your mobile devices sounds like it could be unstable and wonky to the point that publishing can\'t be reliable. If I want to do something proper, I WILL use a computer, no doubt. Like I said, Tapas at this point makes the whole business sound like a game. And I mean games that say blib blib blargh, level up!  \nNonetheless I\'m still veery intrigued to see what the ap will show to be and what it can give us! I know the staff are doing their best and I\'m counting to be positively surprised~ And as long as the desktop version exists I will be happy with Tapastic.', '\nkurapikasuki:\n\nI assume then that the qualifications and premium title concept is being changed up a bit then? Or is this just something for the titles and artists in the premium content section you currently have?\nI also have a question about the new story formats being introduced. Are those open for everyone or that a support program type thing? \'still in beta so only selected people get in\'\n\nParticipating in the key program is open to anyone legally able to enter into contracts for works they have authority to represent. This goes for all formats (comics, novels, short stories). So, if anyone has the next great novel sitting unfinished on their desk, make sure to finish that puppy up and contact us at submissions@tapasmedia.co. \nHowever, please do not send unsolicited stories of any type or format without first sending an introductory email. Shoot us an email first saying ""Hi"" and letting us know a little about yourself and your story (the general idea, how many words, has it been published before...stuff like that). The content team will then try to follow-up within 3-4 weeks. Feel free to share this with all your storytelling friends as well!', ""I'm wondering the same thing as @kurapikasuki. Specifically, will premium remain closed to ongoing series? I've seen some Korean sites post the main series for free, while keeping bonus content (side stories mostly) behind a paywall. Would something like that be an option?\nThe first version of the Tapas key program will only be available for stories that are complete. Stories that are not complete (ongoing series) will not be be using the key program. This may change after Tapas launches and everyone is feeling good about how we're handling complete stories. But for the initial launch only select stories that are complete will be using the key program.  \nThat said, we know there are many, many different ways to structure things so creators are happy with, not only how their stories are accessed, but also how, when, and where they earn revenue. And we would like to grow to the point where we can handle as many of those scenarios as possible. So yes, it will probably be an option down the road, but just not out of the gate with the first version."", ""@AffectedMind -Will the app version generate ad revenue or for now it's something impossible to do?The app will generate ad revenue but right now that ad revenue will primarily be used as a way for readers to earn Keys or Coins.\nAs for regular users the only source of income from the site will be ad revenue and outside Patreon and such?Regular users will still have both of those options. In addition, regular users with complete stories can contact us at submissions@tapasmedia.co to start a conversation about whether or not their work would be appropriate for the key program.\nWill there be any improvements regarding desktop version?Right now all our development resources are focused on the Tapas mobile app. Once Tapas has launched successfully we will certainly be looking at all areas where we can improve.     \nWill there be a livestream discussing the changes like it was with the support program?Absolutely! We don't have a date set just yet but it will most likely be around the middle of February.\nAnd will you add the bloody notifications to mobile versions? XDWe are trying to get as many features into the new Tapas mobile app as possible. There will be notifications. However it is still uncertain what specific notifications there will be at launch. \n@MarvinWill the desktop version still be called Tapastic while the app will become Tapas ? Like Tapastic's little sister ? Yep. The desktop will still be named Tapastic and the app will be called Tapas. And sure, a little sister is one way to think about it. \n@vincentprendickAre there any plans for the mobile preview option in the future or has it been long forgotten? I think it would be a nice feature to add in since the new audience is mainly coming through mobile, so having a preview of how it would look (since the resolution is often lowered) beforehand would be a good preparation.It hasn't been forgotten, just a little lower on the to-do list until Tapas launches. Totally understand where you're coming from though.\nAnother thing I would love to see is more of a creator side of the app, meaning certain options that can allow us creators to see stats, pre-locked episodes that we uploaded, and of course, notifications. The mobile app does have a little bit of that, since we can have instant access to our comic with a push of a button, but it treats us like we're just a normal reader, rather than the creator like on the desktop version.The admin tools for creators will remain on the web version. There will be new tools for certain but we don't have a complete list just yet.   \n@blopHi ! I was wondering if there will be upgrading on the app regarding posting comments, notifications, private messages, etc....There will be changes to the app regarding all of those things and we plan on bringing the community the best versions we can for our launch.\nAlso the question have already been asked but will you do a livestream soon?Our next livestream will probably be somewhere around the middle of February\n@L4213i just have to ask, will the website be getting any attention too now that tapas is seeming to become the front end of tapastic?Tapastic will continue to get attention on an as needed basis until Tapas successfully launches. Then it will be all about driving Tapastic and Tapas to be the best they can be with the resources we have. If Tapas proves to be a huge success that will only help Tapastic as we'll have the resources to do everything mentioned in this thread and then some. ""]",12/22/2015 17:55
77,"Tapastic Update: Profile and Activity Filters, New Embed, and More",Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic!
Over the past several weeks, our team has been hard at work on a number of exciting new updates to the Tapastic website. We are pleased to announce that the following features are now live:

Profile Wall Filters
We added new filters to the profile page to make it easier to sort through different types of wall post content. Now you can easily filter through messages, liked episodes, episode comments, images, series updates and even supporter-only posts. How convenient! We'll be adding even more improvements in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

Pasted image1496x674 441 KB


Activity Page Filters
With the abundance of notification updates, we made sure to add new filters to the activity page as well. Easily sort through comments, messages, Tapastic announcements, comic updates, new likes, new subscribers, and supporter-only updates. Click “See All” on the notifications drop-down menu to access this newly updated feature. 

Pasted image966x677 59.2 KB


New Episode Embed Design
In an effort to help creators make better use of episode embedding, we've updated the design to be more user friendly, particularly when viewing embedded Tapastic comics on mobile devices.

Pasted image1505x753 315 KB

The new design has both cropped and full comic options to accommodate the varied content we have on Tapastic. You can also change the comic description text color to black or white.
The cropped option displays the first 500 pixels of a creator's episode, but has an expand mode to view the full comic in an immersive reading mode. Neato!

Pasted image1482x784 424 KB


Pasted image1503x919 563 KB

The full comic option simply embeds the entire comic on your blog or website. Readers will also be able to view it in the immersive reading mode as well. Nifty, eh?

Pasted image1123x931 606 KB

To use embed, click the new embed button beside the share button at the bottom of an episode. Please note that this feature will only be available if a creator has enabled embedding in their series settings.
Embedding comics on Tapastic is a great way to help creators get their content discovered on other websites and blogs.

Email Settings
We’ve added a number of additional email settings to provide a more customized notification experience. Check your profile settings to adjust them to your liking. 

Pasted image1516x885 67.7 KB


Episode Upload Updates
Last, but not least, we added some improved uploading guidelines and tips to the episode upload page. If you have any questions regarding this, please email michaelson@tapasmedia.co. 

Pasted image1008x781 278 KB


Aside for these web updates, we also have some exciting updates coming to our apps as well. So if you haven't already, be sure to download the Tapastic app for iOS and Android. It's a great way to enjoy Tapastic on the go.
Thanks again for being such an incredible community. You guys are the best! Please provide us with your insightful feedback below. We hope you enjoy the new updates!","[""Great Updates! The embedding in particular wasn't something I knew I needed until now! Great job, staff!"", 'I\'ll have to check further into this, the Activity stuff seems really exciting \n(I made a forum topic about this earlier before this topic was made, so I\'ll just repost what I did here:)\nI noticed on mobile it doesn\'t have this format but it is stuck on the WALL option only (so all I can see are some random likes from a while ago), and they don\'t seem to be accurate or up to date. WALL only contains some random likes of mine from nearly a month ago, not any of my recent notifications to readers. (Unless this is in temporary testing right now, obviously you\'ve already stated that the team\'s still working out some of its kinks  )\n Also idk how I feel about all my comments and likes on other comics being so easily trackable and logged on my wall for other visitors to see >_>. I like to be a little ambiguous...\nCan there be an option tab for, like, ""thank you for subscribing posts"", one for creator msgs and notifications, and another tab for other people\'s messages? I\'ve yet to figure out how the art-work tab is supposed to function as none of my posted pictures have been categorized in that tab. That or the possibility of us manually categorizing stuff into tabs?\nThat or atleast settings to allow or dis-allow the publicity of logged things like likes, comments, etc?\nEDIT: Ooooohhhh Nevermind what I said earlier, it\'s starting to do update recent stuff \nBut now I can\'t scroll down to see all the posts of my past  it seems to cut off at a certain point...I don\'t think it does that on the mobile site though...', ""That's nice and all, but I can't seem to save settings. I just tried configuring my settings, and it didn't confirm that I saved.Revisiting my profile and returning to the settings just shows the same old settings I had before"", ""D'oh! Posted in @MylCreates' topic before I saw this one! I'll just re-post what I wrote there in this thread instead, since I think it's relevant: \n\nYeah, I just noticed it myself, and am trying to navigate around it. I'm not 100% on board with all the likes being logged and shown in public - partly because having all of that shown feels a bit weird, and partly because it just visually clogs up my wall. Clicking on a profile brings you directly to the Wall-tab, and honestly, I'm not interested in seeing all the likes other people have made, nor do I think others are interested in seeing mine; it pushes more relevant stuff (like announcements and thank-you posts) out of sight, which is inconvenient. \nAnd yes, like you, I've noticed that none of the images I've uploaded have ended up in the images-tab. They're all in messages. \nHaving some sort of filter for what is shown would be nice. That, or to just entirely remove the showing of likes. Comments I'm okay with - everyone can read those on the comics in question anyway - but honestly, the likes are pretty un-interesting. Perhaps an option to pin posts, so that they stay at the top of one's wall, instead of getting pushed down by recent activity? Then one can choose to un-pin it when it's stopped being relevant.\n\nI appreciate that the recent activity can now be filtered - it is SO much easier to find relevant info, like comments that need replying to, and much easier to filter out the less-relevant stuff (such as likes, which are nice to get, but doesn't require much in the way of response) - but the Wall needs more filtering, IMHO. It's actually feeling MORE cluttered now that it displays likes and stuff, especially since clicking on someone's profile lands you on the catch-all Wall by default. \nThe option to pin relevant posts would help fix that - that, or a removal of the default display of likes."", ""Just noticed something else! The reading list/series thumbnails on the righthand side of the page are looking strange; they're half the size they used to be, and are kind of squashed-looking. Instead of being perfect squares, they're kind of stretched horizontally. As it is, they're barely legible on a desktop. \nI notice that the text-field in the middle of the page (where all our posts go) is wider than it used to be, but it's clearly come at the expense of the comics-thumbnails. \nI'm using Firefox - I don't know how the profiles behave in other browsers."", ""Oooh great news !\nI have the same problem as Anna Landin about the stretched images.Also, I don't know if it's related, but Zelkats just edited one of her wall posts she did some hours ago. Instead of being send to her edit, the notification sends me on her page only, and I have to scroll down to see the edited post!I'm using Firefox, in case you need it.EDIT : Oh, nevermind. The right edit notification appeared after and it's okay!"", ""On neither the app or the mobile site I can't seem to find a way to turn off the new e-mail settings. I had to go to the regular site on my phone which was less than optimal. Was I just missing the option?"", 'Finally! I\'ve been waiting for these filters for quite some time now, but it still needs to be refined imho. Here are some of my experiences and suggestions concerning the wall  \n\n\nWall: shows everything. Which means that it\'s cluttered by likes now. It\'s the default setting.\n\nMessages: Private messages and normal wall posts from other people are mixed together. It would be better to have them seperated, in an inbox or something. \n\nComics : Shows all comic updates. \n\nLikes: Do we really need to see each other\'s likes? When people wanna know what I like, they can look at my reading list. It\'s not an awful feature, but it clutters my wall and it seems a bit unnecessary.\n\nComments : It shows all my comments on other people\'s work. Kind of neat!\n\nJournals : This doesn\'t exist, but I wondered if it would be possible to create a journal tab. This tab shows all MY posts on MY wall. ONLY them. This could be really handy if one of my subbed creators stops updating (because of personal reasons for an example) and explains the reason on his wall. With the journal tab I could find his important ""journal"" quickly, without having to sort through comments, thank you pictures or the like.\n\nImages : I first thought it was for the little thank you messages, but they won\'t show up there. Is it the equivalent of the creator\'s gallery? If so, then that\'s a good thing. I always wanted to have a gallery. However it looks like I can upload images on other people\'s image wall too - which means that this could become as unorganized as the messages. \n\nFor supporters only : Shows all supporter only content. I currently don\'t support anyone, but if I would I\'d use this feature.\n', ""Guys I am SO HAPPY with the notification tabs, this is something we've been needing for a while and I'm really excited to see it happening. The profile tabs are pretty neat too (especially for finding author posts?), seeing all of your likes/comments on other comics seemed a bit weird at first but I guess it can be a good way to discover new comics, so that's nice.\nMy only concern right now are the tiny comic thumbnails, not only they're stretched out weird, but I also liked having bigger thumbnails because they were easier to notice on your wall \nBut overall, it's a cool update! nice way to start the day haha"", ""Oh! I don't like how the first thing a reader sees when they visit my wall are my Likes and Comments only. I'd really prefer if they see my messages or even comic posts notifications first since that pertains to my comic, and I have announcements there. Announcements that I prefer readers to see since we're not really allow to post those in a series, ya know what I'm saying. : P  It also keeps things more professional/business looking if the Likes/Comments were like the last tab a reader could click on and the more comic related down to business tabs were first.\nI like these features, and the tabs are much need, however that's a BIG fix I'd like to see please. "", ""Yes please >w> I'd like this."", ""Hmmm, I don't think journals would be that relevant, they could probably just fit into the messages tab, as the only lengthy posts I've seen by creators is when they're explaining they're on hiatus. \nMaybe a tab for just creator's messages and another tab for reader's messages (I guess that could include the thankyou messages as that's what's mostly posted by them)\nThe art tab can be used for creator's doodles  so they don't get lost in the thankyou posts. \nI really want an option though to hide the comments and likes tab away from public view though, I don't like the idea of everything little thing I do being so easily trackable. Else I'd be more re-frained from commenting or liking on other creators work which could hurt their stats  \nI'm also pretty sure that other readers of tapastic value their ambiguity, after all, wasn't there a topic earlier where Tapastic was explaining creators not being able to track users who've shared their content for the sake of privacy? >.>"", ""Same here, having my likes and comments displayed like that would make me hesitate before leaving a comment... Maybe just a privacy button would suffice (like for those who don't want their reading list to be visible ?)And it does clutter the wall...\nI like the idea of a journal... When I check an author's profile, the first things I look for are announcements from the authors and potential drawings (cuz pretty art). What would be cool would be a journal section with the possibility for the author to pin their most important posts =)"", 'Yes, I would like privacy settings where people who do not want their comments/likes to be visible are able to toggle it off. And even though I know nobody is going to comb through my comments, I don\'t like the ""Big Brother is watching"" feeling of those things being publicly available just by looking at my page.\nAlso, although I enjoy the wall being separated into tabs now, the default wall now feels even more cluttered than before. I agree with Cyndi that I would like the default tab to be shown is my own messages. The default wall is just too much crap.\nI still would like one separate for PMs.', ""Please please please pretty please add an inbox ! And I forgot to say this earlier but thank you tapastaff for all those filters, they're really neat !"", 'The new updates are very slick. Absolutely love em. Amazing job Tapastic team!', ""Ohhh, I really like these updates, it really helps! But I agree, I'd rather have my own posts only on my profile when someones is visiting it :S"", 'I agree with a lot of what\'s already mentioned here. Some of these updates are great!  The only thing I would have to complain about is showing ""likes"" and even ""comments"" on the wall. It looks cluttered already, and even though I only write positive comments about other people\'s comics, it\'s a little uncomfortable to see everything displayed on my own wall like that.\nThe Journal thing might be an interesting idea? Don\'t know, hadn\'t really thought about it until others mentioned it.\nOther than that; great job!  I like the profile wall filters a lot, as well as the activity page filters, awesome ']",6/10/2015 1:57
78,Changes to Spotlight Banner and Daily Snack Featuring,Announcements,[],"Hey hi hello!  
Part 1. Spotlight Banner Schedule Changes
Starting in August, we'll be increasing the number of cycles for our Spotlight Banner. Instead of featuring one comic for 7 days, we'll be reducing the feature to 3 days. The shorter cycle will allow for us to feature roughly 10 series a month. With this reduced feature time, we will also feature a series multiple times throughout a calendar year. We hope to create content synergies with this faster paced featuring cycle. 
We'll experiment with this for the remainder of this quarter and share preliminary results with everyone.  
Part 2. More Long Form Comics in the Daily Snack
As many of you know, I like to experiment with the editorial side of Tapastic. We're home to a great diversity of content and I always want to showcase that within our website and mobile apps. And as you might have noticed, I have quite an eclectic taste.
The Daily Comic Snack via our mobile apps has been driven primarily by short form gag comics. It made a lot of sense during it's introductory phase to keep it as casual as possible because we were seeing such a large influx of new readers. We wanted our initial batch of mobile first readers to get used to the idea of opening the app frequently and commit five to ten minutes a day. 
We saw that if a new reader were to open the app consistently for the first three days that they would begin to explore the app beyond the Daily Snack. We saw mobile subscriptions sky rocket from recurring readers. We were seeing exponential growth from mobile readers compared to desktop readers in terms of episodes read per session. 
Once we were comfortable with that initial batch of readers, I decided it was time to deviate from only featuring short form funny content. You might have noticed that I've been including a lot more longer form narrative episodes within the snack. Recently, I featured Chapter 1 Part 1 of Heroes of Thantopolis by Strontium (read here45). This is sort of a perfect example of what I'm looking for when featuring long form content. 
Chapter 1 Part 1 has 9 pages worth of content. It's a lot but not too much. It gives just the right amount of information - we're introduced to our protagonist, get a sense of the milieu, and it's followed up with a great cliffhanger. It invites the readers to explore and subscribe to find out more. Being beautifully drawn also helped 
The episode performed REALLY well on the Daily Snack. 
And for the past two months, I've been trying to integrate more long form content. But the problem lies with some of the formatting on Tapastic. I find it difficult to feature an introductory episode for a comic if it's only a page long. It's tough to give the reader enough context in only one page. As silly as this might sound, I'm really looking for an introductory episode to do most of the following: tell the reader who, what, when, where and why. It doesn't need to hit all of those to get featured, but enough of them. We need to give the reader a reason to subscribe. 
This isn't to say that the creators have been going about making their introductory episodes incorrectly so far. This is something that I've only really recently found out through the process of curating and looking for content. But the sooner we make changes, the sooner we can start featuring more long form content on the daily snack. 
It's a lot for me to ask.
I reached out to Sixteentons, creator of All Our Cuts and Bruises (read here22) if they were comfortable with compiling their episodes together so the introduction would be longer. More specifically, I recommended compiling the first handful of pages in order to have episode 1 end on that last image with the narrative box tucked away in that corner. The ending to the first episode adds a lot of intrigue and ends on a really poignant note. Plus those  last handful of images are just #$%&ing gorgeous. 
However, part of my reticence was in the fact that deleting some of their episodes meant losing out on those comments. While you can screencap them, it's just kind of tough to delete them, you know? You lose out on those likes too. Sure, they might be decorative, but they MEAN something. 
Which is why I know it's a lot for me to ask and also why I don't do it that often. 
However, for every long form creator out there, it's something to consider in the future. And if I reach out to you to make some changes, I'll totally understand if you don't want to. But if you meet me halfway, I think we can start to set a good example for other to follow and establish some best practices for Tapastic. 
But yeah... this post got really long, sorry about that.

79,Introducing the Tapastic Support Program 2.0!,Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic! We've got another exiting update to announce today! We've updated our Support Program! 
Since we launched the beta version of the Tapastic Support Program back in May9, we’ve received a lot of valuable feedback which has helped us improve it significantly. Today we’re excited to introduce the second iteration of the Tapastic Support Program Beta.
Highlights
Creators define their own tiers of rewards for the Support Program

Pasted image662x1024 496 KB
 
Creators now have more control over how they can reward their supporters in the form of “Milestone Rewards”. These rewards are defined and set by a creator and are meant to encourage his or her supporters to keep contributing for a long time. For example, a creator can define four support milestones– say, $5, $15, $30, and $50 — and set a designated reward for each of those milestones. Supporters who reach each milestone will be rewarded with something unique and fun made by the creator.
 
To elaborate further, supporters are rewarded based on their total support amount, not monthly support amount. In other words, support for each creator is cumulative. This makes things simple for our creators because they only have to provide a one time reward  to any supporter who hits a new support milestone.  After all, we know it’s challenging enough just to make comics.
 
Supporters can designate their Support amount
Our Support Program now gives supporters the freedom to choose their monthly support amount. Supporters can manage this amount by simply clicking on +/- button (or entering any custom amount up to $999). A higher monthly support amount will help supporters reach the next milestone faster, but even $1/month support will get them to the next milestone eventually.
All the existing benefits of the Support Program Beta remain
All the benefits of the initial Support Program Beta still remain: you can directly support your favorite creators to help them continue making their comic series that you’re passionate about, you can get full access to all content, including optional “Supporters only” content, and you’re added to the supporter list on the creator’s profile page and comic series page.
Your Feedback Matters
We plan to roll this feature out in waves, starting with a handful of creators. We’ll gradually open up the Support Program to more creators, and eventually to all Tapastic creators so they can setup their own Support Program right in the dashboard.
If you’re a creator and are interested in participating in our Support Program Beta, send an email to peter@tapasmedia.co with a link to your Tapastic profile. We’ll also keep you posted on our progress. Meanwhile, feel free to check out these new support features and give us feedback in this forum thread. Here are the current creators in the program. We encourage everyone to share the love and start supporting:

Thanks for using Tapastic! ","[""Yay for this!\nJust a question though:\nIs there any possibility of a PayPal option being added in the near/far future? Stripe is a good system, yes, but it's really only for those who use credit cards, and so it closes off the opportunity to support for those who maybe use PayPal connected to their bank account/debit card/etc. I was considering supporting one of my own favorite artists here and now I can't because it only takes credit card via Stripe, and I know I'm probably not gonna be the only person in this situation either v___v\nSo is this a possibility for the future or is there a specific reason why PayPal isn't currently/won't be available?

81,Tapastic Update: New Notification System,Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic!
You may have noticed some ""new"" changes to your reading list notifications. Well, you’d be right. We just updated Tapastic's notification system! Below are the details:

Screen Shot 2015-04-28 at 11.13.26 AM.png1394x520 526 KB
 
The “New” Indicator
Similar to the previous Reading List notifications, the “new” system will notify you whenever a series has new episodes via your Reading List. Rather than showing the number of episodes added, it now simply indicates whether or not there are new episodes for you to read. Plus, when you visit the series page the episode list on the sidebar will specifically mark which episodes were added since your last visit!
 
Reading List Notifications for Unlocked Episodes
This update also allows a better means of notifying non-supporting subscribers when episodes are first unlocked. Supporters will still receive a Reading List update when a locked episode is initially published, but now non-supporters will also see a ""new"" mark on their Reading List once the episode is unlocked.
In other words, if you have a Support Program and upload a locked episode ONLY supporters will be notified, but if/when you unlock it (or it auto-unlocks, if you scheduled that), regular subscribers will be notified. In either case, it will just look like a new episode was added to their Reading List, rather than the Activity Notification they used to get in the past.

Screen Shot 2015-04-28 at 12.59.26 PM.png984x449 335 KB
 
 Read and Unread Tracking 
You can now see which episodes you've read on Tapastic, to better track where you left off and make sure you don't miss a comic. You’ll notice unread (fully bright/opaque) and read (semi-transparent/faded) episodes are distinguishable now, just like on the mobile apps.
 
The current episode is also more clearly highlighted in the episode list, whether the sidebar is expanded or collapsed.
 
Pro tip: press the F key to see how this works when the sidebar is collapsed on web.

82,Tapastic Update: Edit and Crop Tool for Shared Thumbnails,Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic!
We have an exciting new feature update to announce!
A few months ago we decided to increase the size of the Facebook and Twitter thumbnails of shared comics to help creators get more clicks to their series on Tapastic. However, this caused a few unexpected consequences where Facebook and Twitter were cropping comic thumbnails poorly. Creators, are you tired of your Facebook thumbnail getting cropped in the worst possible spot? Well, guess what? We've made a feature to solve this very issue.
Edit and Crop Tool for Shared Thumbnail
Creators asked for it, and we made it. Now when you create a new comic episode, you will be able to choose which part of your comic you want to be your shared thumbnail with our new Edit and Crop Tool.

Pasted image1024x660 430 KB
 
This has been one of the most widely requested features by creators and we are happy to announce that it is built! Choose your thumbnails wisely.
Please note that this new crop tool will work great for your newly created comic episodes, but may not for some of your older episodes because of the way Facebook and Twitter saves your cached comic thumbnails. In other words, Facebook and Twitter may not use your newly cropped image on older comic episodes because it still has your old thumbnail saved from long ago. But, fear not! We are currently working on a way to fix this problem too so that every comic that is shared on Tapastic has a thumbnail that is exactly the way you want it.
Thanks for using Tapastic! Please leave your feedback below. Happy cropping!","[""Hey! I've been using the thumbnail crop for a while now, but I noticed sometimes the thumbnail doesn't load, and it just shares an invisible image.

84,Evolution of Tapastic’s Community Feed - Best New Webcomics on the Web,Announcements,[],"Hi Everybody!
We are continuously evolving our product to help more comics get discovered. 

Our Front Page on the web is a lot more dynamic. Popular and Trending sections are determined by our algorithm which will continue to evolve as well to optimize our overall experience. Think of this as A.I. that is accumulating data and learning along the way. Some cool stuff here. 
Our Mobile App has launched and we are getting some great feedback. Currently our Daily Snack Feed is static, but it will evolve as well in due time. This is a COMMUNITY FEED meaning that it's a shared space. 
NOW - Our BEST NEW WEBCOMICS42 has evolved (or I should say evolving) as well. This section is in BETA. Previously, this space was static, but now we've added algorithm as well to make it dynamic. As you may notice, serial or story-based comics are also included. We need your help in taking it for a spin and provide feedback. AGAIN - THIS IS BETA, a test.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
As we add more algorithms to replace manual curation, it's very important that our community helps the staff or itself by keeping a close eye on it. I now hope the creator community better understands the importance of Comics only in Episode policy because as a community, we should strive to provide the best reading and comic discovery experience for readers. We'll be continuing to improve our features to enhance the overall experience to minimize any confusion. We ask for your patience.

Comics only in episodes policy
Thank you for bringing that issue up in the recent newsletter. There is still a lot of room for confusion, though!    1) There are lots of non-comic episodes that I KNOW were allowed, at least in the past before you guys rolled out the profile post notification feature. For example, in one of the past newsletters, you spotlighted a Christmas collab done by several creators and posted in their comic episodes. Are these things still allowed in episodes, now that we have the ability to post them on ...



Lastly, we'll be holding a townhall meeting soon to address some concerns shared by the community. Look out for Michael's email. Some things are better said than in writing. Hope everyone can participate. Thank you for your time. 
Again, please check out the new Best New Webcomics42.","[""Glad the story-based comics would be included. I can get that it doesn't really fit for the daily snack category though.\nI'll be following Best New Webcomics closely...I love that everyone had a chance. Thanks for this amazing platform! "", ""We're constantly updating the mobile apps! Stay tuned for more improvements on our apps."", ""If you guys really intend to be the best web comic platform, you will have to stop imposing the Korean web toon format on non-Koreans and accept that web comics are more than that.\nWeb toons are popular in Korea. Fine. Some non-Korean cartoonists play well with them. Fine. But web toons are not the end all of web comics. I'm very critical because you favour the vertical scrolling type of comics beyond anything else. If you do this to enable your apps and digital comics viewed on phones, that's one thing. But digital comics and web comics are two different beasts. They are not the same. Web comics' formats are open-ended and creator-controlled. Web toons and digital comics curtailed by a platform are not open. You need to stop being fuzzy about which you are or not because it affects creators.\nRight now you have the numbers but you will not be the best platform for Web comics until you address these issues seriously."", ""I can understand this argument, especially since I'm so used to the horizontal way of reading.  It takes a little adjusting to read the web toon stuff but its not a dealbreaker for me.  I remember my first time trying to read Tower of God and being so damn confused.

But what Tapastic does have to offer is great so I'm not complaining.  I'm sure in the near future they will be open to BETA stuff like this."", ""@ToonDoctor Thanks for the feedback. I think it's a misunderstanding that we are imposing Korean webtoon format or imposing anything at all. We have strict content guidelines that we enforce, but format control is not one of them. We leave it up to our community to subscribe, vote, comment, and share what they like. The algorithm takes those metrics into account and ranks them in real-time. Staff Picks is the only section where we highlight certain comics and we usually feature ones based on metrics + check if comics are legible on mobile phones. You'll see that many featured here are not in webtoon format. \nThe staff's responsibility is to understand readers. This can be easy via direct feedback or more complicated via user-behavior testing and analyzing data. Then, we try our best to communicate our learning to creators, not impose our ideas or force changes."", 'What @minzinger said. We\'re not imposing anything - Tapastic is an open platform so you can upload any comics in any styles of any lengths. We never ever take down or bury content unless it voilates our content policy. \nAs for vertical format - I\'m not sure if it\'s ""Webtoons format."" Many, if not most, of popular webcomics are adopting the ""infinite canvas"" model - Think The Oatmeal, Zen Pencils, Loading Artist, or any of popular comics on Tumblr. I think vertical is only one aspect of the larger question, ie. whether the content was created with predominantly digital consumption in mind or print consumption in mind.  \nOne thing to keep in mind here is that Tapastic is a two-sided service and there are two types of users that we want to serve well - creators and readers. (This is similar to Uber having two types of users, drivers and riders.) So naturally we\'re constantly thinking about providing the best user experience for our readers. Majority of our readers now access our service from mobile. And we know it\'s not the most ideal experience when users are presented with comics that have never even considered mobile use case at all. That\'s why we definitely encourage creators to optimize their comics for mobile use case, or at least think about mobile use case. However, that, again, certainly doesn\'t mean that we will take down or bury comics that are not optimized for mobile.', 'The issue with what you call mobile-friendly is that for Tapastic, it is vertical only, because that\'s how your apps are designed. Ergo, only vertical ""web toons"" appear ""optimized"" for your mobile users. It becomes a circular argument that the majority of mobile users will then favour vertical comics. That\'s what I mean when I say that you steer creators in one direction and that you do not address our concerns. If horizontal scrolling was available, your results would change.', 'Oh, I see what you mean better now. In the future we might think of a more elegant way to support ""mobile"" in addition to vertical scrolling, such as each panel appearing on tapping the screen (think Photo slideshows or something). But right now we don\'t have it. We\'ll continue thinking about how best to support mobile comics.', 'I am Tap reader for a long time. Lots of cool new stuff since I first joined. So many changes!

85,Tapastic Update: Comic Categorization,Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastinauts!
Notice anything different on Tapastic today? We just released a major update that will get the community more involved in the comic discovery experience. Going forward, every time you read, subscribe, like, comment, and share a comic, you will help creators get their comics discovered more than ever before with the newly updated categories on the homepage and browse page.
Why the change? We now have 7,000+ comic series on Tapastic. That’s a lot of comics! With so many new series being added every day, we needed a new way to surface our content. 
Categorization Updates
We created 5 new sections to effectively categorize comics on Tapastic, all of which you can sort by genre on the browse page. 

Screen Shot 2015-03-24 at 12.19.02 PM.png969x667 598 KB
 Popular
This section will surface comic series with the most engagement in the past 24 hours. That means series with the most new subscribers, likes, comments, and especially shares will be showcased. 
Trending
Trending will show comics that experience the largest positive changes in subscribers, likes, comments, shares, and views. All series have chance to be Trending, even brand new ones as long as readers are consistently engaged. This section will update frequently throughout the day since series engagement is constantly changing. 
Fresh
Whenever a comic series is updated, it will appear in the Fresh section. This is to help newly updated series get discovered on a regularly basis. Please note that a series will not repeatedly appear at the top of the Fresh section if lots of episodes are added at once. This is to ensure that all creators who update their comics get a chance to be discovered. 
Tapastic Picks
Tapastic Picks will consist of hand picked content by the staff. This will update regularly as the staff finds awesome new comics that make best use of Tapastic. 
All
The All section is what the old browse page used to be. You'll still be able to sort series by subscribers, likes, comments, date created, and name.
We also added a new Premium and Discover More section on the homepage. Check it out! 
Please note that our team will be constantly optimizing this new system over time. There’s still much room for improvement, but we believe this is a step in the right direction for the community. We’re extremely excited to see what comics you will help us surface. So don’t forget to subscribe to series you love and like, comment and share episodes you enjoy. Your actions decide which creators get discovered on Tapastic and beyond. 
Thanks for being such an incredible community. We have lot's more exciting news to announce in the coming weeks. Stay tuned! As always, please let us know your thoughts below. Happy discovering!","['This is an awesome update!', 'eh? where are those?', ""Nice!

For the most part this update sounds pretty legit. =3"", 'Same I was like ... oh great... how are people with few yet very engaging fans going to make it to the first page (because they could though comments), but the descriptions did make sense, however, does that mean it\'s now clumping ""likes, comments, etc"" all into one section? \nBecause now I\'m just seeing the effect where ""popular comics"" and ""trending comics"" are ALMOST EXACTLY the same. Because, duh, popular comics most likely have the most subscribers, thus most likes which I\'m guessing would straddle any number of comments smaller comics could amass like they used to. \nI\'m so sorry if I\'m sounding picky  , I\'m just still skeptical of the new format and I wish the option of picking most ""comments"" ""likes"" ""subscribers"" etc was still an option. Atleast with the old popular comics format I actually saw diversity in the comics depending on their category and I did actually catch, not so prominent comics featured within those sections. Now  I\'m seeing the same comics in both categories. \nI do like the option of ""Fresh"" though. It wasn\'t as obvious in the previous update. That\'s a +.\nBut I no longer see categories, does this mean Tapastic\'s no longer doing themed categories for say holidays or special events? ', 'This looks like a really good update! However, I agree with @ratique in that the ""Fresh"" category would do better to appear on the front page - that gives lesser known/less popular comics more exposure, which is great for everyone. \nI know the category is only a click away as it is, but with all those other categories grabbing attention on the front page, people are less likely to make that one click to find it.', 'I like the layout of the front page... but I think it\'s not the best solution.As @MylCreates already mentioned: The chances that in the popular and trending section are the exactly same series, is pretty high. I\'m personally not a fan of that... I think it suggests that we don\'t have enough different good series to fill the places. I have absolutely no idea about programming but wouldn\'t it be possible to write a little code that automatically avoids duplicates on the front page? \nAside of that I like the new algorithm!\nI really understand @ratique\'s point. I was a  little confused at first as I wasn\'t able to find the ""Fresh"" section. Personally I would really like to see this on the front page! It\'s a great way to discover new series!\nAnother thing about the front page.. and I would really like to hear other people\'s opinion about that: Imo The best solution for the big banner, was the one one year ago. Three series featured at the same time (the images was changing). The banner pictures are always gorgeous, it gave the page such a dynamic WOOSH. Now I find it a bit static... especially because when a new series gets featured.. I check it out. Depending on the content I subscribe.. or I don\'t... and for the next 5 days I\'m just looking at a pretty picture. When I got featured I noticed a huge boom at the beginning... and a little less every following day (still a lot, but slowly falling). That might have been just my impression though!  However... If you\'d put it down in numbers featuring more artists at the same time (maybe again with the moving header WOOSH) would help more people in less time... I guess... ?', 'Hope it will work =) \nAnd I truly hope - it will be as fair to small projects as to big ones!', ""\n\ntaihendechu:\nThe banner pictures are always gorgeous, it gave the page such a dynamic WOOSH. Now I find it a bit static\nAgree 100%\nAlso, I vote for the 'fresh' to go to the frontpage. The way I see it now is that staff is worried that 'low quality' comics will make a negative impression of the site if they are displayed on the front yard. But since we have here so many comics here, the list would be dynamically changing, and it would give a chance to many creators to draw a bit of attention. And we have to remember that people (includingmesadlyforthemostoftime)are generally lazy creatures, so if they have a choice of finding a comic by 'search +scroll + click +search +several clicks' or  'scroll + click' they choose the later option..."", 'Woh, this is great ', ""I totally agree, I'd love to see some changes to the top banner! It's just boring to see the same series featured for a week. I'd say let it be either 3 series featured for a week with the old carousel type header, or change it daily or every other day!"", ""I'm pretty sure it will help new comics, nice job!"", 'The""fresh"" section is a great idea and I think it will help artists get more exposure!', ""\n\ntaihendechu:\nThe chances that in the popular and trending section are the exactly same series, is pretty high. I'm personally not a fan of that... I think it suggests that we don't have enough different good series to fill the places. I have absolutely no idea about programming but wouldn't it be possible to write a little code that automatically avoids duplicates on the front page?\nWe totally agree. We are working on an improvement for this right now. Thanks for the feedback!"", 'It\'s better than it was before, but there are still some things which I would like to see (hope you don\'t mind):\n\nbanner changes (3-5 comics per week are promoted instead of 1) \npopular and trendy shouldn\'t feature the same comics, because if I don\'t sub a a ""popular"" comic I certainly won\'t sub the same ""trendy"" comic and other series won\'t get the exposure. Also, it looks like Tapastic has only a few comics to visitors, because ""why would the same stuff be featured twice if there were enough comics?"" \nthe collections are gone and most of my favourite comics were part of collections (manga madness).Many creators were glad to be featured in a collection and it was a nice way to find good comics from a particular genre without having to search.I already suggested something similar in feedback: *Just like the collections, there could be a weekly/monthly theme which is shown on the front page. For an example: Supernatural, The brave, thought-provoking, silly, Zombies - anything goes!Themes show a small selection of comics which are picked by Tapastic\'s staff and belong to that theme.*\nplease let ""fresh"" on the front page. ""Fresh"" doesn\'t only show bad comics, it shows many many good works which otherwise go unnoticed. \n', ""\n\nNagashiKhan:\nOut of curiosity, how long will fresh series' be posted?\nThis all depends on how many creators update per day. Fresh displays 150 unique series episode upload results. Once a series is updated today, it will move up to the top of the Fresh list and push previously updated series down 1 space. Keep in mind, uploading more than one episode back to back won't bring a series to the top of the list repeatedly. So technically a series that uploaded today still should be in the Fresh section for more than half the day (depending on the amount of episode uploads we have per day). Hope this sheds some light. Thanks for the feedback!"", ""\n\nratique:\n\nWhy is this not on the front page? It looks way more interesting and I would love it as landing page. I realize that it is easily accessible by just clicking one button, but we all know how lazy we become when browsing the internet. \nAnd what about people who get to this site for the first time? Would they be more impressed if they would see the categories on the first page instead of the second?\n\nThanks for the feedback!\nRight now, the homepage is intended to display the top content across all genres and categories on Tapastic. To address the issue of genre discovery, we added clickable genre tags to the thumbnails to allow readers to jump into the corresponding genres on the browse page. We're hoping that readers will make use of these tags to jump into desired genres. With that being said, we're constantly iterating to see what works best.\n ""]",3/24/2015 16:39
86,A few thoughts on mobile comics,Announcements,[],"We recently launched our brand-new mobile apps, yay! (Check out our launch promotions4!)  This was one of the biggest launches we ever had during the 2 1/2 years' history of Tapastic. Why? Because Tapastic is all about ""mobile comics."" 
Tapastic's mission #1 is to provide the best platform for comic creators to publish content, build fans, and make money. Meanwhile, on the reader side, currently our top mission is to provide the best mobile comics experience. Mobile is fundamentally changing the way people consume content, and Tapastic will become the best platform for readers to find and enjoy awesome comics on mobile. More specifically: 
1. Tapastic will actively promote mobile comics
New medium needs new content; publishing old content to new medium never works. Comics should now be screen-optimized, not page-optimized. We believe that showing traditional, print comics on mobile hurts user experience, and it doesn't take many bad experiences to make a user leave and never come back. 
We have an internal system set up to identify mobile-friendly comics. On our mobile products, we will heavily boost mobile-friendly comics over traditional comics. This means that, if your content is not mobile-optimized, your awesome comics may get buried and not discovered by mobile users - who, last year, accounted for 60% of Tapastic's traffic.
2. What are mobile comics? 
So what are mobile comics? There are many different components that make a comic a mobile comic, and it's often difficult to outline all those individual components; but as they say, ""you'll know it when you see it."" 
The key is to create comics in the first place with mobile use case in mind. Mobile devices have limited screen space, so make sure your readers can go through your story easily, panel by panel, on mobile devices. Some people think Tapastic is all about ""vertical format"", while really, we're all about mobile format - vertical being one possible way of mobile comics. 
Some people also seem to think that mobile comics are just short comics. That's not always true. Though in general mobile content tends to be shorter in length (think Twitter vs. blogs), we don't think only 2-panel comics are mobile comics. Time and again, we see the best comic episodes are the ones tell a complete piece of story, and the optimal length to tell a complete piece of story varies depending on the story.
3. Creators should optimize their content for mobile 
We're often surprised to find out many comic creators don't even see their own comics on mobile. This is probably because creators mostly work on PCs to create and publish comics. But it's very important to make sure your comics look good on mobile. We're planning to build ""mobile preview"" feature on dashboard in the future, so stay tuned for that. ","['Wow I\'m really looking forward to the ""mobile preview"", I think that would be pretty helpful for creators (cough at least to me cough). Regards', '@Menbung Meanwhile you can check out your comics on m.tapastic.com and see how they look on mobile..', ""I'm thinking of putting a small tutorial up for converting your 'page style' comic to a mobile version. It's a lot of work, but it makes a HUGE difference on Tapastic mobile.\nI found a few little tricks that might help folks out."", 'Can you guys just answer one question that\'s been bothering me for a while now? I swear I\'ve had the Tapastic app since like, December, so I\'m hearing it\'s launching now and I\'m like ""... wut"". Is this just like, the grand release of it or what? :U', '@UzukiCheverie Thanks for having been using our app! We launched the new Android app in December,  but we wanted to wait our big shout-outs until the new iOS app comes out, which just happened. Apple took their time (to say it nicely) ', 'oooOOOOH THAT\'S WHAT IT IS LOL I was just super confused, I thought the app in general was launching now and i was like ""but i already have it"" xD Thanks for explaining x3 <3', '\n\nck_tapastic:\n\nWhat are mobile comics? \n[ ... ]\n""you\'ll know it when you see it.""\n\nGreat! In that case, can you provide examples, @ck_tapastic?\nWhat are some comics you consider ""screen-optimized""/""mobile-friendly?""', '@eethy Are you currently using our mobile apps? The comics that we feature on the Daily Comic Snacks are usually good mobile comics.', 'It would be nice to have a preview feature which allows us to test a comic/episode on a mobile device before we officially release it.

There is a good reason why everyone thinks you mean scroll when you say mobile: people don\'t know any alternatives. \nI obviously love the vertical scroll format, since my own comic uses it, but not everyone does. It\'d be great if you can show them some alternatives that might appeal to them more/ may be more feasible to them without having to sacrifice their creative vision too heavily.', '\n\nck_tapastic:\nThe comics that we feature on the Daily Comic Snacks are usually good mobile comics.\nMost, if not all the comics I\'ve seen on Daily Snacks are gag strips and in vertical format. What are some thing that long format story comics can do to adapt to the ""Daily Snack"" style of mobile comics?', ""I'm guessing, short episodes with imagery large enough to fill the phone dimension nicely and text that is clearly legible.\nBelieve me, its a bit of a transition to adapt previous work done in graphic novel flat format to vertical scroll mobile. But it works, and it looks really cool once it's all together.\nI've been slowly converting mine over.5"", ""Yep, I've been reformatting my standard page comic to vertical, specifically for Tapastic with mobile in mind, for the past year now. I'd like more clearly defined directions/input from Tapastic what their vision of mobile comics are, so my series/hard work (and other artist's creating long form story comic series) won't get ignored. Because that's a bit messed up."", 'And how would I exactly optimize my comic for mobile? What size does it need to even be? >.> I draw on DELETER manuscript paper which is a type of paper size used by professional manga artists from Japan and I have to shrink the page to the maximum size Tapastic has to offer...', ""Make each panel close to 940 Pixels in width. It would be like designing every panel like a full page image. It seems odd to do it that way, but you can't think about layouts the same way you do for your print based manga. Also, your text needs to be very readable, so the layout of your speech bubbles is going to change dramatically and you'll have to be more careful about how wordy your dialogue is.\nI tried doing the standard page format and it is impossible to read without pinching and zooming. The mobile reformat works well and you don't even realize the scrolling if you've set your images up and spaced them nicely."", '\n\nCyndiFoster:\nMost, if not all the comics I\'ve seen on Daily Snacks are gag strips and in vertical format. What are some thing that long format story comics can do to adapt to the ""Daily Snack"" style of mobile comics?\n@CyndiFoster We\'re thinking about best ways to show long-form, serieal-stories comics on mobile feeds in the most effective manner. We\'ll experiment with a few different ways in the future.', ""Yeah that's the size I've been using for it, my dialogue isn't too lengthy but I still need to zoom in a little on a mobile device sometimes but not by much, on my kindle fire I don't even need to zoom in."", ""Hmmm...

89,Tapastic Update: Support Program Enhancements and Discontinuing Twitter,Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic!
We just launched some really cool new features to help bolster the Tapastic Support Program!  

Auto Unlock

Creators in our Support Program will now be able to set an unlock date and time for their locked comics! 
 
After locking a comic, an option to unlock the comic manually or automatically will appear next to the lock toggle. Manual unlock functions the same as the locking feature did previously. Auto unlock, on the other hand, allows creators to set a specific date and time for their comic to unlock for everyone to see after it’s published. Once the comic unlocks, all subscribers will receive a notification.
This feature works with our scheduling tool as well. Creators can set a comic to unlock a certain amount of hours or days after an episode is scheduled to publish. Pretty handy, eh?
 
We think this will give the lock feature much more utility for both readers and creators, and make it clear to readers that not all locked content is meant stay locked indefinitely. We’re very excited to see creators in our Support Program make use of this new update!

Screen Shot 2015-02-09 at 6.27.00 PM.png1000x450 175 KB
 
For those of you who are new to the Support Program, episode locking is one of the unique features of the Tapastic Support Program. It allows creators to set certain comics to be visible only to supporters. If you have any questions about the Support Program, check out our info page3, or feel free to email peter@tapasmedia.co.

Support Banners

To help creators better advertise their Support Programs on Tapastic, we’ve added a new space for creators to upload a Support Banner, which will appear at the end of each episode in a series. This banner will link to a creator's support page.

Screen Shot 2015-02-09 at 6.13.18 PM.png1012x459 157 KB
 
Creators in the Support Program will be able to add this banner in their series dashboard. The banner ad dimensions are 280 x 180px. 
 

Discontinuing Twitter Signup/Signin

If you haven’t heard the news yet, we will be discontinuing Twitter signups and signins on March 1, 2015. Details about this change can be found here in a previous forum post10. All you need to do if you’re a Twitter user is make sure you have a valid email and password saved to your Tapastic account prior to March 1st. You’ll be able to use that email and password to login before and after March 1st. We’ll be sending out additionally notices in the coming weeks.

Thanks everyone for your continuous support of Tapastic, and the digital comics space as a whole! Feel free to provide us with feedback below.

Seriously, I haven\'t the locking feature because it was just too hard for me to remember about those things, just like @UzukiCheverie xDNow some questions:\n• Would it ever be possible, as Supporter, to pay a one-year subscribtion instead of a monthly withdrawal?I ask this because I really don\'t like to have more ""bills"" to pay, I prefer to pay cash for something and be done with it for a while. I think I\'m far from being the only one and that more users would be more likely to Support like this.\n• Would it be possible to start donation pools to achieve community goals?Just so people could make a one-time donation of say 25$ and directly hit a milestone, like on Kickstarter. Then they could keep a Supporter status for some time – maybe the creators could define how long they want it to last, like, the base ratio would be 1$=1month, but if they think their work is ""worth more"", they could decide that 5$=1month. So a person who\'d give 25$ would be Supporter of this series for 5 months instead of 25). I honestly think that\'d be my favored way of Supporting, because I\'m more interested in giving money to the creators I like than to get milestone rewards, however awesome they might be. I know how much extra work it may imply, and I also notice that some of my Supporters never claim their milestone rewards even when I poke them about it (do they even get notifications that they hit a milestone?)']",2/10/2015 0:30

91,Tapastic Update: Premium Launch,Announcements,[],"At Tapastic, we believe creating sustainable business models is a critical aspect of building a healthy creator community. Over the past two years, we’ve introduced the Tapastic Support Program, where fans can directly support their favorite creators, as well as an Ad Revenue Program to qualifying creators, which we plan to extend to even more creators in the coming months. 
As part of our continuing effort to build a thriving creator community, we're excited to announce Tapastic Premium. This section of the site will be home for readers looking to purchase high-quality, completed comic series, as well as being an additional venue for creators to monetize off of their digital content.
The Tapastic Support Program and Ad Revenue Program both lend themselves to creators with an ongoing series, while Tapastic Premium is a perfect fit for creators who already have finished work. We hope that Taptastic Premium will open up our platform to even more creators in the future. For our initial launch, we've invited creators with exceptional comics recognized by our community and we will be continually inviting more creators in the coming weeks.
Due to Tapastic’s unique publishing structure, we wanted Tapastic Premium to build upon and enrich the existing site and features. We're adopting the same episodic publishing model that currently exists on Tapastic, while also allowing creators to have the flexibility to designate ""free” and ""locked” episodes. Other services tend to utilize short previews or snippets of content that we find unhelpful when it comes to making a purchasing decision. Instead, by having batches of episodes unlocked, creators can give readers a chance to experience larger portions of content before deciding to buy.
But to give you an even better idea of what we have to offer, we're giving away 1,000 copies of Moonlight Hair Part 1 for free!
 11
Creators will be able to use Tapastic Premium in different ways beyond creating complete, graphic novel-style series. For instance, a creator with an ongoing series might bundle or archive a set of older episodes into a “volume” or “season” for sale on Tapastic Premium, while still taking advantage of ongoing series features like Support and Ad Revenue for their newest episodes. Think of this like TV shows, where DVDs or digital copies of past seasons are sold while current seasons air for free. 
Currently, Tapastic Premium is only available on our desktop website, but we’ll be adding it to our upcoming (brand new!) mobile apps soon. We're also going to be featuring more series on a weekly basis. Stay tuned for Noru coming on February 4th!

It goes without saying that we're incredibly excited to be introducing even more ways to help creators make a living off of doing what they love. We're also very confident that you'll love the Premium experience and we're offering a full money back guarantee. We hope to continue innovating the webcomic industry and we believe that this is a great step forward.","[""Thanks or the free copy! I think the prices are nice! I'll be looking more into them later.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the new additions:
Support Program Setup
Creators that have been invited to our Support Program can now fill out all necessary support related information right in their dashboard on Tapastic. This includes their support and thank you messages, milestone rewards (which are optional), and payment information for requesting earnings from the Support Program.

Once a creator has submitted their Support Program for review and our team approves their submission, that creator can access the brand new Support Tab in their dashboard. Here a creator can see an overview of how much support they are currently receiving (or have received in total) and access and edit their support page message and milestone rewards. Creators can also view a detailed list of their current and past supporters to keep track of who their biggest contributors are and which supporter milestone rewards need to be fulfilled.

Revenue Tab
In addition to the Support Tab, creators can now access all of their earnings information from the Support Program in the new Revenue Tab. Here a creator can look at their balance, transfer their earnings to PayPal, and look at past, projected, and total revenue information.

If it's the former, then the figures for me coincidentally happen to add up to the latter.And likewise, does Total support revenue show me the aggregate donations of all time or the aggregated monthly pledge?\nWish I really, really would like to be able to see my supporters' email addresses, for organizing correspondence. Using Private Messages on Tapastic accounts means that I don't have a single, organized place to see all of my correspondence at once. A great alternative to this, though, would be a sort of onsite Message Center specifically for correspondence with supporters.To generalize, I'd like to be able to easily message (and receive messages from) one, several (for example: all who earned a specific reward, such as livestream access), or all supporters at once, in an organized and accessible place.\nBug report In the exported CSV of the list of supporters, the value user_name is null for everyone rather than their username."", ""\n\nAtokNiiro:\nTo generalize, I'd like to be able to easily message (and receive messages from) one, several (for example: all who earned a specific reward, such as livestream access), or all supporters at once, in an organized and accessible place.\nHi Janus, \nThanks for the feedback! This is good stuff. \nWe are currently working on making the messaging process more seamless between you and your supporters (specifically on your supporter list page).

Yes, we can withdraw a payments via paypal, but for the other way around - when actually supporting someone - you need a credit card. Not everyone owns credit cards. \nHaving PayPal connected this way would work for both people who are supporting and people who are asking for support - it means that people who don't have credit cards but still have PayPal accounts for online transactions can still support the creators they want to support, and creators -looking- for support may actually see an increase in supporter revenue because it wouldn't be limited to just credit card users. \nI know there are a lot of people I'd love to be supporting right now, for both the sake of helping them out as well as being able to see that special locked content, but I can't because I don't and probably never will own a credit card, at least not for a long time. Please fix this. It's really not fair to people who don't or can't own credit cards but have a perfectly working PayPal account that's standalone or linked to a debit account or whatever, and having them miss out on the exclusive content and supporter opportunities they could have taken part in just because the website lacks the feature.

There are a few things I want to mention here:
1)  Do you care about Tapastic so much that you want to be a part of the building process? This is your golden opportunity. You get special access so that you can provide feedback. Tell us what's good and what's bad. We know you are our super-user because...you are a Tapastic Supporter. ^^
2)  Help other creators out. With the Support $, we are paying creators to make awesome Creator's Guide to Tapastic1. Are you finding these guides helpful? Do you have a topic you want to learn about? We want to do more of these so our community can help each other be more sucessful. 
3) Get exclusive Tapastic Gear while supporting Tapastic!!! Yes, we'll post some more photos - Postcards, Stickers, T-shirts, and Mug. We will be continuing to give more cool stuff away.

What do you think about this feature? Also, besides notifications, what other features would be most important for the new app? Your feedback matters! \n\n1.png720x1280 575 KB\n ', ""I think designing a stumble type of feature for example, 'if you liked this comic you might also like these' comics and make an algorithm to help readers find similar types of comics to those they either search for or already have on their reading list. This can be related to the genre they read a lot of or search for and also for example a lot of other subscribers of series you subscribe to also read these comics. Like what amazon does with recommending what other users also buy when they buy this product.\nThis helps users discover comics they actually might want to read without overwhelming them with too many choices, by only giving a limited set of similar options. To avoid this being repetitive, you can also have a 'don't show this comic again' kind of button in case they don't like what they are being recommended but keep being shown the same ones. I'm not sure how it would be implemented but what do others think?"", ""@yuliusefferven Very good suggestion. Tapastic has more than 4,500 comic series now so obviously it's very important to provide good discovery mechanisms! "", ""I personal find the app very hard to use. It looks great and has great features, but I've been spoiled by what the website has to offer. So even when I'm on my phone I view the full website on my phone instead of the app. As a creator, I like being able to see notifications of likes/comments/subscribes, looking a the analytics of my comic series, make edits to a comment or page description if I find a typo on my pages, and just the lack of limitations the website offers over the app. Please keep improving it, you may covert me to an app user yet.

95,11/20 Creator Newsletter,Announcements,[]," 
Spiffy new banner courtesy of feyuca. Lots to cover this week! 
There's a new update to the Creator's Guide to Tapastic2. Feyuca returns to discuss more in-depth about paneling and some things to avoid when making comics. Also, I think she absolutely killed it with that long, long vertical panel, you know what I'm talking about. We preview our next guest artist for the series at the end of the episode too so check it out! 
Cyndi Foster, creator of Oops Comic Adventure, made this really cool guide for Free Self-Promotion Through Project Wonderful2. I highly recommend giving it a read and taking advantage of this awesome feature. 
Also, Lui, creator of Oh the Irony! just started a Tapastic Secret Santa in the forums. This is a great way to meet other creators and get some fan art. 
You've probably noticed us tinkering around a bit with the forums lately. We're still in the process of revamping our forums but so far the community response has been fantastic and we'll be taking some time to highlight a few of our favorite topics in the Creator Newsletters. 
And finally, we just launched a Support Program2 for Tapastic (drawn courtesy of NoxFox, creator of Singmire Haze). We've been commissioning a lot of artists for future episodes of Creator Guide to Tapastic and have been brainstorming on some other fun series that are creator driven. Every dollar that goes into our Support Program is going directly back to creators. The more supporters we have means that we can reach out to even more artists to create helpful guides or tutorials to help you become that much better at storytelling. 
We'll be doing some fun supporter only events in the near future, giving sneak peaks of future feature updates, community live streams, heck, we even made a supporter Minecraft server that you can hop in and freely torment us in. Huge thanks to Codesurfer, Elli, SiriLA, Gofer, Wurf, Silius_Xix, Emiliano Perez, Corey Willis, Kiahroseking, tmccall341218, Velnna, Jctaele, Kurisquare, Jana and Lae for jumping on board!

We just launched some really exciting new updates!
Support Program Dashboard Update
Creators! Have you checked your Tapastic dashboard lately? You may notice a new ""Support"" tab. We are happy to announce that all creators can now submit a Support Program on Tapastic! Simply navigate to your dashboard, click the support tab in the upper right hand corner, and start filling out your support program information. After you are done making your program spiffy, submit it for review. Please note that all creators on Tapastic can submit a Support Program, but only creators with 600+ subscribers on a single series and a regular uploading schedule will be eligible to have their Program approved. We'll let you know either way after you submit your program. Interested in learning more about the Support Program? Go here1. For general questions, please check out our FAQ1.

Navigation Bar Changes
We've also updated the navigation bar to better showcase our comics and creators on Tapastic. By selecting ""Comics"", you will now see links to the Daily Feed, Collections, and Browse section. Selecting ""Creators"" will take you to the new browse page for creators.   Please note that links in the former ""Community"" drop down menu such as the Forum and FAQ are still accessible in our footer.
 
Updated Browse Pages for Comics and Creators
As you might have noticed, we've updated the layout and design of our browse pages for both comic series and creators. On the new browse page for comics, you will now be able to easily subscribe to new series by simply hovering and clicking the plus icon. Much like the older version of the browse page, you will also be able to sort through series by genre as well as subscribers, likes, views, comments, date of last update and by name (which is alphabetically sorted).

Pasted image1024x392 316 KB
 
As for the new browse creators page, we used a similar layout and design as well. Easily see which creators have a Support Program by clicking the ""Supported"" filter or by simply looking for the green support cup icon.

Our team has some awesome new updates to announce this week!
Homepage and Collections Update
We've updated the design of homepage when you are signed in to help you better discover new comics to read on Tapastic!
The first thing you might notice is that we got rid of the rotating series banner. We made this change because we found that only the first few series banners were getting clicked by readers.  We decided to change this to a ""Series Spotlight"" section to put more emphasis on one series at a time, and to carry over the design of our signed out homepage. This spotlight banner will be updated regularly by our staff with banners made by creators.

Pasted image1024x371 507 KB
 
Our new ""Comics for Everyone"" section will display collections of some of our favorite comics, grouped thematically. These collections will be updated regularly too as new comic series are added to Tapastic by creators . Be sure to keep on the lookout! 
Pasted image1024x459 565 KB
 
We also added a brand new collections page to make it even easier to discover comics just for you. Spiffy!

Pasted image1024x557 557 KB
 
In addition, we've combined the previous ""New and Noteworthy"" and ""What's Hot"" section into one ""New + Noteworthy"" section. Use this section to find more of the latest and greatest comic discoveries by our staff. We felt that it was important to expand, and place more emphasis on this section to help readers discover fresh new comics, and to help some of our favorite new creators get discovered.

Supporter List Messaging
This update is for all of  you creators in the Support Program. We've added a new messaging feature to your supporter list page to allow you to mass message a selected group of supporters. Use this to send milestone rewards, request shipping information, and help you keep in touch with specific supporters.

101,NOTICE: New Ad Server may temporarily affect your Ad Revenue,Announcements,[]," 
At the end of this month (August), Tapastic will be switching to a new ad server. This change will improve our Ad Revenue Program experience, but it may result in temporary service interruption for advertising. To elaborate, Tapastic.com will be up and running, but ad banners may not load from time to time. During this period, we ask for your patience.
What does this all mean?
No more Publisher Portal
Currently, creators are required to log into Publisher Portal, or a separate page, to track ad revenue. We are using a third-party software. Publisher Portal will go away with this update in September.
Ad Revenue tracking on Dashboard
We are continuing to improve our creator Dashboard. In addition to tracking your series performance, creators will soon be able to directly track monetization including earnings from the Support Program and Ad Revenue Program.
Ad Revenue Program Eligibility
Creators email us all the time to see if they are eligible for Ad Revenue Program. Although our staff does a great job sending out invitations when creators become eligible, we want to make the process more transparent. Soon, creators will be able to directly check eligibility on Tapastic.

102,"Tapastic Update: Comment Upvoting, Supporter and Creator Badges, Navigation Changes, and More",Announcements,[],"Ello Ello Tapastic!
We've got some exciting updates to announce this week!
Commenting Improvements
We've decided to make a few changes to episode commenting to help create richer discussions between creators and readers.
Upvoting
First and foremost, we've added upvoting! If there is a particular comment you want to stand out amongst the others, give it an upvote! You can also downvote as well if you think a comment is distasteful. We hope that this added functionality will put more meaningful comments in focus.
 
New Supporter and Creator Badges
We've added special badges for comic creators and their supporters to appear next to their profile thumbnail in a comment thread.
 
If you are a creator of a particular series, you will receive a special ""creator"" badge. This will help readers easily identify you in the midst of a big comment thread.
 
If you are a supporter of a particular series, you will receive a special supporter badge next to your avatar. Why? Because you are awesome and creators want to know who their supporters are. Want the badge? Start supporting these creators for their hard work. Please note that this will only appear if you are commenting on a series made by a creator you are currently supporting.
Comment Display Changes
We decided to show the top 3 comments in a comment thread after each episode to encourage more discussion.
Navigation Button Improvements
We also made a few updates to the next, previous, and top navigation buttons on the series page to give better descriptions of the content within a series and to inform a reader what's up next.

Pasted image1024x641 895 KB
 
Default Series Format will be Last Episode First
We've changed the default viewing of a comic series from ""first-to-last""  to ""last-episode-first"".  In other words, if you view a comic for the first time, you will see the last episode of that comic series first. Why the change? We received a lot of feedback that  readers like to view the latest and greatest comics first, unless the series happens to be in a serial format.  In order to accommodate  serial comic series, getting to the first episode is just one click away in the upper right hand corner of the series page. Piece of cake.
Keep in mind that if you have already started reading a comic, Tapastic will save where you left off. No need to worry about this update affecting where you left off in a particular series. As long as you have a Tapastic account, your spot is saved on our website and apps.
Please give us your feedback below! Thanks for being awesome!","[""The first 3 comments thing is kinda weird. Keeping all comments hidden at the start may be nicer. Adding nesting comments might encourage discussion more. I really like the badges though that's a grand idea. As to the nav button idea, a undo accidental jump to the start of a 100 page comic that you're up to date on might be nice because I just had that problem while reading Strays. "", ""I think it's nice that the comments are showing now, it was weird for me that they were hidden by default. But maybe add an option for creators to make them hidden again, if they don't want them?\nAnd I love the navigation buttons, really helps when reading a long comic!  And I like the Last episode first format, because there were comic that I read somewhere else before, and it was kinda annoying to scroll though all the comic to find where I left off."", 'Oh the I like having the comments as shown, but only the top 3 is confusing because the current implementation includes responses in that count. The nav button is great too and I know a couple of comics that it would have been nice for too and hopefully it will be useful for a few more. ', 'Awesome! I like the new changes, all of them. Showing comments immediately works nice for me so far, but I gotta use these new changes a little more to be sure. But everything looks improved so far!  ', '\n\nbrianorlando:\nDefault Series Format will be Last Episode First\nI like this. Mostly because I\'m always concerned about people seeing my own comic from the first episode and then ONLY reading that episode (or the first two/three) and then not liking it, because my comic changes its style and quality so much after about 20 comics or so. I just don\'t want people to be turned off by the ""pilot"" episodes when the comic was first starting and experimenting with its style x3 So I support this 100% <3', ""I definitely like the badges and upvoting/downvoting function for the comments section! Haha it's nice to see the 'creator' badge next to your name. Makes me feel validated. The navigation is great too, makes things a little more smooth. Thanks for all the hard work!:)"", ""Got to say, loving that badge. Was pleasantly surprised by it while replying to commenters today, and I have to say, it's a cool addition. ^^"", ""Same as SMYoshi, I just replied to a comment today and oh, nice badgey! That's a great thing I think, I'm very happy with it! And I like the up and downvoting too, because sometimes I really feel like upvoting things OuO\nI'm also happy that the discussions are shown some more again because I do find that it encourages discussion. I like comments so much, and it's also nice to see what other people write, but I was less tempted to look when all the comments were hidden.\nThat's a nice bunch of changes!"", 'Love the updates, thank you.

That's great!"", ""It all seems great, though I'm having a migraine and bit trouble reading the tiny black text on the white background because it sends me nasty daggers to my brain.\nBut yey!

103,Tapastic Update: New Homepage Design Update and More,Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic!
In case you haven't noticed yet, we've updated our homepage5!

signedouthomepage.jpg1440x1488 364 KB
 
Pretty snazzy, eh?
""Read Comics, Support Creators"": this is what Tapastic is all about. We wanted to make sure this message was super clear to all new and existing Tapastic readers and creators. Also, as many of you already know, we have ""Comics For Everyone"" —not just about valiant super heroes or maniacal villains, but about life, love, cats, zombies and everything you can possibly imagine. Tapastic is for all walks of life and we wanted to make that known to the world.
In addition to better explaining our message, we feel as though this design update allows us to clearly define the benefits of Tapastic while still showcasing our favorite creators and comics. If you refresh the page, you will notice that a random creator and their series is displayed with a large cover banner as the background. This will be continuously updated by our staff. Some of the creators we are showcasing right now include Devin, Kelly, and Feyuca, but we plan on adding lots more. Creators, we will contact you!
Keep in mind, you will only see the homepage like this if you are signed out of your Tapastic account. Feel free to log out to see it for yourself.

Tumblr gets away because they're hiper famous I guess, But I don't know if Tapastic should use that strategy.It looks cool though, but showing some attractive links to actual comics alongside that index could be attractive too.\nThat's what I have to say for now, thanks for the good work!""]",8/21/2014 18:02

105,"Tapastic Update: Coming Soon Filter, Creator Page, Homepage Update and More",Announcements,[],"Hello Tapastic!
We’ve got some exciting updates to announce this week!
Coming Soon Filter
First and foremost, we’ve added a Coming Soon Filter to scheduled comic episodes. If a reader comes to the end of a comic series and there are scheduled episodes posted by a creator, then the reader will see this filter applied to the next scheduled episode:

Pasted image1071x559 41.4 KB
 
The idea behind this new feature is to provide readers with additional motivation to subscribe to a series. If you are a creator and like to schedule your comic episodes in advance, you will be seeing this filter applied to your next scheduled episode as an additional incentive for your readers to subscribe.
Creator Page
We’ve made a snazzy new page21 to explain the benefits of Tapastic to new creators. Help us spread the word by sharing this page with other creators!  Also, don’t forget to check out some of our creator monetization benefits on this page, if you haven’t already.
Homepage Update
We’ve added a new section to the homepage  called “What’s Hot” to better showcase some of the top trending series on Tapastic. We’ve also decided to get rid of the Community and Creator Spotlight sections in an effort to put more emphasis on series discovery.

Yes, they are not that popular as the series about cats, but I don't remember when the quality be determined by the number of views or something like that. Views might determine yield as well quality - further attendance.\nFor example, I ran across tapastic a dozen times, but I started to use it regularly only when I saw a  Yuumei review. And it all just because from side tapastic might look like a poster with gag-strips.\nI hope i write is understandable, because I'm not native-speaker"", 'I think I understand what you mean. So the point is, different users are drawn to different genre of comics (in your case I guess drop dead gorgeous and more serial stories-based comics?), and for these people to not think that Tapastic is only about gag comics or cat comics, there should be ways to at least educate users there are other types of content on Tapastic too with labels and menus and such... Did I understand you right? ', 'Yeah, more or less.\nAnd the fact is that the concept of ""chapters"" for these kinds of comics are very different from each other.For example, John Doe should draw a 15-20 pages per month, but he can\'t publish them upon completion of each, because it can destroy the story. In this case, the page must be connected to each other in a long strip and posted once a month.\nOn the other hand we have a Jane Doe, she publishes a ""chapters"" consisting of a single page, but every other day.

106,#Primetime now Ad Revenue,Announcements,[],"Helping creators whether it be through getting discovered or monetizing has been the driving force behind Tapastic. Since we launched the #Primetime program in January 2013, Tapastic has provided over $350,000 to Tapastic creators. We are extremely proud to be making a direct impact on the lives of our creators. We couldn’t have asked for better creators in joining us on the forefront of the digital comic publishing revolution. 
Moving forward, we want make it very clear that every Tapastic creator has two (2) ways to monetize – Support and Ad Revenue. Therefore, we decided to change #Primetime to the Ad Revenue Program.
Ad Revenue Program:

Grandfathered In. If you have been receiving ad revenue, you will continue to receive ad revenue. Nothing changes there.
No more paypal fees. We made some big changes behind the scenes to make this possible, which is great news for creators!
The $25 minimum threshold still applies. While on the program, if your ad revenue for the month is below $25, that amount will carry over to the following months and you will receive a payment when the total balance is $25 or more.
We are retiring PRIME.  We’ll be removing the green ‘prime’ icon next to creator names. This change is based on feedback from our creators and our first step towards a bold new direction for Tapastic.
No more Daily Schedule. The Daily Schedule is already retired from our website. Did you even notice? We received ZERO complaints in the last two weeks or so. We will be retiring this on our mobile apps in the near future.
Also:  Business opportunities will be individually discussed with you as they come.

For additional questions, check out our FAQ25 or ask away in this thread!","['This really awesome but does this have to do with views or how many has subscribed because I dont know how new people can check out my work for me to be eligible of #Primetime. ', ""Views, subscribers and ad revenue are all intrinsically tied together. The Ad Revenue Program is going to be replacing the #Primetime program altogether. You'll notice that we serve two ads after each episode, which means each view has the opportunity of getting two ad impressions (you won't get the ad impressions if the reader has ad block). \nIf you have more subscribers, then you'll be more than likely to have more views and more opportunity to get ad revenue. Hope that helps!  "", ""I've noticed the lack of Daily Schedule, which made me a little bit sad as it was helping me get new subscribers.

They set up the ad revenue for members who update often and have a decent following and don't show any sign of stopping any time soon so that they put their money into something that's reliable. It's pointless to set up ad revenue for a comic that updates whenever it feels like it and only has a small handful of followers (because the followers are where they get most of the ad revenue support from and such). \nI'm sure when Tapastic becomes a lot bigger and has more funds, they will consider ad revenue for a larger amount of people, but for now that's just how it is for the sake of quality control and reliable content. \n\n\nnibburra:\nI guess that make sense since it be a good way for quality control but how would one be able to monitor the traffic the gernrate or would that solely be on tapastic's side of things\nDo you mean monitor traffic for your own comic? You can do that already by going into your dashboard and clicking on the Stats button next to the comic you want to know about. It'll give you a graph showing the rate of comments/shares/likes you've gotten over the past 30 days, as well as a table showing the stats of each individual comic and how many comments/shares/likes each one got. It's a helpful tool if you like seeing those kinds of numbers /nod nod\nAs for those with Ad Revenue, there is the Creator Portal that's only accessible by those who are a part of it, and that allows them to track their CPM and all that jazz.

And from the data that we\'ve collected, more people are subscribing and the general flow of traffic is going towards more creators. It gives the reader options. \nThere are a couple of things to consider when approaching the front page banner section. For starters, we have to approach two different kinds of users: first time users of Tapastic, and a returning user. I feel like we\'re addressing both the needs of those readers by pointing them towards a collection. Aside from that, we have to gauge what kinds of behavior the user should get used to. If you look at the front page, every series has a thumbnail image, and the collection page is no different - we are getting the user comfortable with assocating a series with a thumbnail. It also places a strong emphasis on better designs for individual thumbnails. \nAs for reducing the number of clicks, we\'ve seen that it doesn\'t have a high impact. Users that want to read will read, and users that bounce will bounce. I understand that logically, having additional clicks would lead to a higher bounce rate, but so far that hasn\'t been the case.', ""That's fantastic!

110,"Site, Facebook, Tumblr and Tapastic",Announcements,[],"Hi people, I have a little doubts about were is the best place to publish my comics. Now I've been published in Facebook, Tumblr, Tapastic and I finished my site today... It's a lot of place... Well, what the best way to get new fans or have more visibility? Share you experience! =D Cheers! ","['First off, congrats on getting your own website! ~ \nWhen it comes to the ""best place"" to publish comics, I find it usually goes in this order (depending on advertising and in my own personal experience): \n\nTapastic\nFacebook \nWebsite\nTumblr\n\nTapastic has definitely given me the most exposure so far because it\'s a website oriented for webcomics, obviously lol and it has quite a few systems like the ""New Releases"" tab and a daily ranking system via most views, most subs, most likes that help allow the comic to be seen by others. And of course the staff is always promoting people as well. \nWhereas on Tumblr there are -millions- of people and unless you\'re friends with a lot of people there who are willing to advertise you, your chances of getting seen are about 1/99999999  \nFacebook isn\'t so bad because you can invite your friends and family to like your page and if you have some extra cash you can ""boost posts"" and your page, which basically means for a set budget for a certain number of days you can promote your page to a target audience who would like your comic. It definitely helped me get my FB page out at least; I\'m at about 60 likes, which I know isn\'t a lot compared to other webcomic facebook pages lol but it\'s a big jump from what it used to be (like, 20). \nAnd views on your website just depends on how much you advertise it. You can use advertising systems like Google Adsense, Project Wonderful, and word-of-mouth (and of course you can always promote via your Facebook page or Tapastic; Tapastic allows you to add the website of your webcomic if it has one to your webcomic information so the website will appear just above the description box). Project Wonderful would probably be your best bet for advertising just because it\'s got a lot of other webcomic artists working there and the funds to do ads can be cheap to almost nothing at all. They aren\'t great for pulling funds in lol but they\'re good for having a system to advertise through. \nThat being said, do not forget that doing webcomics is not a competition to see who can rack up the most views or fans  Uploading your webcomic to several places can not only be a pain (I recently knocked off a couple places where I uploaded them - such as Tumblr and SmackJeeves - because it didn\'t really do much on either website and I didn\'t like uploading them there, which is kinda hypocritical honestly lol) and it divides your fanbase. Would you rather have fans scattered on different websites throughout the internet or would you rather have one or two concrete places for them to find your comic? (and trust me, if they\'re reading a comic from a certain location - whether it\'s tumblr or Tapastic or your website etc - they\'re probably not going to change it anytime soon because that\'s just inconvenient for them; I know it\'s inconvenient for me as well when I\'m reading a webcomic because I like to read it where i\'m comfortable reading it, which is usually always the location I started reading it in the first place).\nSo while it\'s great to have some variety in reading locations, don\'t forget that your viewers are reading your comic because they like it and want to read it; so definitely give them the kindness they deserve in return by not treating them as extra ""views"". While some places are better to host comics because they will get more exposure in that location, always remember that you -will- get readers, no matter where it is, and wherever you do get \'em, treat them with respect. You might make some new friends in the process ^__^ ~\nI realize this is a super long response lol I hope some of my advice is at least helpful and that it\'s of use to you in some way /nod nod\n. . . also you should link me to your comic website, i\'d love to check it out :3', 'I have a ot of experience in a few places... pretty much all bad unfortunately.\nFACEBOOK - I have 580 people following me on Facebook. Once I reached 550 a year ago, the count just stopped. My theory is that once you tap all your friends and family from Facebook, your count is done. Posts don\'t go to everyone unless you pay to BOOST the post. Facebook is terrible.\nWWW DOMAIN - I have had a domain for Charmy\'s Army for 3 months. I am using Blogger to support the feed. I had 16 people follow my blog in just the first few days!!!! Then nothing. With a million blogs and domains numbering millions more, getting people to see your page is an impossibility.\nCOMICS SHERPA - I spent three years on the website Comics Sherpa and never saw an increase in readers. The parent site, Go Comics, gets millions of hits per day yet the readers do not even know the Sherpa site exists. Go Comics does not promote the Sherpa users. For $100 a year, I expected some promoting from the site. I felt I was throwing my money away and left in February.\nYOUTUBE - I am just now exploring YouTube. I am creating an animated cartoon and hope this could be a means of obtaining new fans.\nIDEAS FOR PROMOTING - I made up business cards last month and plan on hitting a few Comic Cons beginning in May. I am hoping to have the first 5 - 7 minutes of the animated cartoon prepared in time so I can loop it in an attempt to draw people to my table.\nI am new to Tapastic... three days in... and hope this may be the best place to get my comic strip to readers who appreciate a good laugh. It is so hard building a fanbase. Sometimes I think the reason my success hasn\'t erupted is just me and my strip are sub par, Very well could be the case, but its my dream and I refuse to stop trying!!!!\nDavy JonesCreator of ""Charmy\'s Army""http://tapastic.com/series/CharmysArmy12', ""Good guys!

I see a lot of comics that appear to do well on there, so I'm sticking with it for now, but, yeah. Not a ton happening.\nWith all that, I'd say I'm pretty maxed out on places I want to post my comic.

 Hey hi hello!
Welcome to the brand new Tapastic forum! 
We burned down the old one and now we're back with a forum that's bigger, faster and easier to use. We spent a lot of time trying to tinker with the old forums but we decided that we needed a fresh start. 
Old cookie-cutter forums just felt too slow, too static. We originally played around with the idea of having a single wall like Facebook where people can post freely. However, we saw that posts were getting buried way too fast for any conversations to really blossom. So we took our favorite parts from the old and the new. And here we are!
Even with the sleek and ultra-modern update, this forum won't work without YOU. 
So venture forth, and start some conversations, make friends, and most of all: have fun. 
If you have any questions about how our new forums work, then feel free to reply

117,Publisher Update: Changes to Genre Feature,Announcements,[],"Hi there, 
Tapastic has grown a considerable amount in these past few months in both publishers and readership. As such, we'd like to increase the discoverability of content and make sure that readers are getting to content that caters to their tastes. 
Genre selection is a feature that we've had many internal discussions about alongside frequent feedback from publishers. We've decided to set the maximum number of genres for any one particular series to three. 
We feel that this change is a necessary first step to ensuring that your series gets in front of the right readers. This increases discoverability and also increases the effectiveness of the genre tab. If you feel that three genres is simply not enough, then please feel free to utilize our tag system which can be used in conjunction with our new and improved search engine. 
The effective date for these changes is Tuesday, October 1st.
After the effective date, we'll be going through our entire library of content and manually changing the genres of any series that still exceeds the three genre limit. However, we want to remind everyone that you can still change the genres freely at any time. 
If you have any questions, comments or concerns, then feel free to e-mail me back or join the discussion on our forums.
*All the best, -Michael from Team Tapastic* ","[""Just curious here (namely for those who don't get to read this and end up wondering what happened post-October 1st):\nAfter the effective date, we'll be going through our entire library of content and manually changing the genres of any series that still exceeds the three genre limit. \nWill you select the three (or just the one, since it's the minimum) most fitting for the comic as it is to date, or the result will be randomized from whatever genre they originally chose?"", ""\n\nAndrej:\nWill you select the three (or just the one, since it's the minimum) most fitting for the comic as it is to date, or the result will be randomized from whatever genre they originally chose?\nWe'll be reducing it to three based on a selection from the five that they've chosen. \nThanks for asking that, I should have clarified on that point  "", 'love this!

Very good idea and I cant wait to get more readers.', 'Yeah I think it\'s great to cap it off, don\'t want peeps clicking everything and spammin\'!\nOne improvement/enhancement I\'d like in that realm is maybe an deeper explanation on how keywords factor how your comic is ""distributed"" though the site.

119,#Primetime Ad Payment Discrepancy,Announcements,[],"Hi #Primetime creators!
Few creators have emailed us saying that there is a $ amount discrepancy between August Ad revenue balance on your ad dashboard and the payment received. The reason is due to upward adjustment to $ CPM (more $ owed to you) after the month's end which may happen from time to time. Don't worry, our system records the amount that we owe and you will be paid the following month. Please see example below.
If you have any question, please ask below.
Thank you,
