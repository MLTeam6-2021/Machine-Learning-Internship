1,I’ll Review your Novels,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey there, Calliope here.I have just started reviewing novels and I'm trying to be honest everywhere yay! I will post the review here as well on your wall. Sadly, I'm also a full-time worker so this might take time.
I'll either be a gentle critic, goldilocks critic or a harsh critic. It's up to you to decide what type of criticism you can take.
It'd be better if you guys could send your story links in the way below:Title:Genre(s): How many chapters you want me to read (It can be the complete story too, but then you would have to wait for a week at least)Story synopsis:Critical hit required [gentle, goldilocks, or harsh criticism as mentioned above):Story link:
Note: 

I'll be reviewing only one story from every person, so please refrain from adding up more stories.
You can subscribe and read my story, Purple Shades of Blood2 if you want, it isn't necessary, really, but would be great help to increase my reader base.
I'll be reviewing every story quite slowly, reading almost everything to review it properly, so please don't feel bad if I don't respond quickly.
I accept poetry and short stories, but  anything that isn't considered to be a story [like quotes, zodiac stuff et cetera] isn't on my list, thank you
NO NSFW PLEASE. I'M 21 BUT NOT COMFORTABLE WITH READING IT.
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME TO READ MORE THAN 100 CHAPTERS BECAUSE I HAVE TO REVIEW OTHERS' WORKS TOO.

2,I will review all chapters of your novel/comic,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello!
I've decided to critique novels/comics simply because I want to, and I think this will help me find good reads. Reading other's work will also help me improve my own writing. My review will be more from a reader's perspective than a critic's, but I won't shy away from harsher critiques. 
I will review all (at the time of my review) episodes/chapters of your novel or comic. My review will look at the following list:

Prologue/Premise
Setting
Characters/Characterization
Dialogue
Grammar/Spelling Conventions
General artwork/writing (readability)
Style of the novel/comic 
Plot
If the comic/novel is complete, I will also look at the overall structure of the story.

If you want me to focus on any particular point on the list, let me know and I will make sure to pay special attention to it. Post a link to your novel/comic if you would like me to review it. Please let me know if you would prefer for me to message you the review instead of posting it in this topic. Also, since I am reading the entirety of works, I might be a little slow. Thank you for letting me review your work!
If you want to give me some critique on my novel as well, go ahead!

3,I will review the first 5 (Mostly more) chapters of your novel/comic!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello there!
Reading through other’s work and scrutinizing their good and bad parts can help one learn and improve a lot from their own works. So, I will review the first 5, and if I like them, over 5 chapters of any work posted here. The review will be completely done from a reader’s perspective and will mostly be my opinion on them.
The things I will review will be:
-The cover/banner
-How hooking the prologue is.
-Impressions on the first few chapters and whether they make me want to keep reading.
-General story and/or artwork.
-Style, tone, and setting.
-Writing/storytelling style and how smooth it is.
This is mostly meant to be a way for me to learn and grow myself and I do this hoping I could be of some help to the great creators on this platform. If you are interested in this, please share the link to your work along with whether you would like the review to be in the thread or as a personal message.
Thank you very much for your time.
If anyone would like, then please feel free to review my work as well. I will be very thankful.

6,Will edit your blurbs (for free),Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, people of Tapas!
I'm trying to break into forum territory, lol, so I figured offering a smol service might help me achieve that, haha.
So, as the title says, I am here to edit your blurbs!
By blurb I mean: short description of your story (no longer than 300-400 words) written to tell people what it's about and entice them to read it.
By edit I mean:

review readability: how much sense your blurb makes and what it conveys.
grammar and spelling check.
sentence structure and flow.
overall impressions.

For easier editing, please paste in the content of your blurb as a post on this topic!  
Disclaimer #1: my expertise lies with novel writing, so if there are any specific comic blurb rules, I may not be aware of them! Though I think in essence they're fairly similar, so I am open to editing both novel and comic blurbs 
Disclaimer #2: there is no payment required, but I do ask for your patience, haha. Real life permitting, I may or may not be able to get to these right away.
Now lemme see yer blerbs 
Ok so while I still do not require any payment for editing your blurb, I thought I'd leave the link for my novel Seacliff here, so you can subscribe if you like - it'll publish Aug 19 as a Premium title ^_^ https://tapas.io/series/Seacliff2","['You are amazing for doing this!

When he finds a pocket watch with the power of ""Trial Run"" - the power to bend reality at his own will - Ivan\'s destiny changes.\nWith just the watch and his wits, he embarks on a conquest to rid the world of Magic. The filthy magic that steals, the filthy magic that deprives, and the filthy magic that kills.\nIvan will stop at nothing to achieve what he wants.

7,Chapter Cover Design (help pls),Reviews | Feedback,[],"Looking for some feedback and/or suggestions; I'm definitely overthinking this. My comic isn't up yet, but I've been working on the first chapter for the past few months. Before I started drawing pages, I drew this chapter cover:

8,[OPEN 0/3] Giving your comic honest feedback/reviews,Reviews | Feedback,[],"When creating comics, I know how difficult it can be to judge how your story/art is progressing from an unbiased perspective. You already know what the plot points are, where the story is headed, and you've been looking at the same panel for so long that you don't notice the obvius typo right in front of you. Even when asking for feedback from friends and family, they tend to sugarcoat issues in an attempt to not hurt your feelings. Sometimes though, you need honest feedback in order to improve your work. So, in this thread I'm going to do exactly as the title says - give honest feedback. 
I should first mention that I'm not an expert writer or drawer myself so don't expect any technical or detailed breakdowns of the entire structure of your story. My feedback will come mainly from a normal readers perspective. I also feel like I should note that I don't plan on roasting your comic if I don't like it, there's a difference between honest feedback and just being a jerk. I'm hoping the review I give sheds light from an outsiders perspective. For reference, I'm typically a fan of action/adventure/fantasy while not really enjoying stories where romance and drama take the spotlight. That being said, I'm open to critiquing any genre. Just be prepared for certain biases.
I'll also only be reviewing the first few chapters of your comic, depending on how long each update is. If your comic is dozens of updates in, then this probably isn't the thread for you since I wouldn't be looking at your most recent work.
 Now that that's out of the way, let's get started.

For now, I'll take the first 3 people (if a bunch of people start showing up) who post their story in the comments. Please include:

a short synopsis (2-5 sentences should be enough to convey what your story is about, you can just copy/paste your summary if you think it does the job)
the genre(s) it falls under
what you want my critique to focus on (eg, story, art, layout)
which updates specifically you want me to look at (if your story isn't linear, ie gag comics)


 Here's a reference ""submission"" (that's totally not a sneaky ad for my comic):

The style reminds me of early to mid-2000 rage comics with simplistic characters on a white background. There’s nothing that really makes it stand out among the plethora of other gag comics, but it works as a way to easily and quickly convey humour to the viewer. One thing I would suggest is to put in a bit more time in making the comic look neater. I noticed that for close-ups, you enlarge the base character image instead of drawing a new one. This is especially noticeable when you get really close6 to a character, you can see the blurred lines and the artifacts around the eyes and mouth. I would also try and keep the font size consistent unless you’re trying to highlight certain words – don’t change the font size relative to how much space you have in the speech bubble, change the speech bubble in order to fit the font.\nThe humour for me was rather hit or miss. A lot of it again reminded me of early to mid-2000 gag comics, where the punchline was less about making a joke and more of subverting expectations. That can work in moderation but overusing it can get boring quick, especially when you can start predicting the actual punchlines. There’s also a few jokes that just went over my head (out of juice2, dead squirrel2). While I may just be an outlier, sometimes a joke will make sense to you because you know the context around it while not translating well on paper.\nI tended to enjoy the puns, 4th wall breaking and ""relatable"" posts the most. Out of all of them, lost arm5 was by far my favourite. It’s a simple punchline that relies solely on visuals, but is a perfect fit for your art style. Others that got a smile out of me were left side, motto and clone (to name a few).\nOther things not related to the comic itself are to try and make your cover and banner stand out more. The webcomic market is very saturated right now, so it’s a difficult battle to compete with everyone else. The saying goes “don’t judge a book by its cover”, but that’s exactly what people do; in order to get people to even click on you, they need a reason.\nI’m not sure what your current process is like, but I’d recommend writing down a bunch of ideas and then going over them with someone else and see what they think. A lot of jokes that may seem funny to you may only be funny to you. Having another set of eyes to offer a different perspective can weed out a lot of the “misses” and improve the overall quality of your comics. Your jokes have definitely improved since you started, which is great considering you’ve only been doing this for a couple months.', 'Thanks for the feedback. I don’t normally get critique on my humor even if I ask for it, so this was helpful to hear. And I never knew about the font size thing, which makes sense now that I think of it.', ""Synopsis: A young girl receives a magical stone, making her what is known as the medium.

It’s common for stories to throw you right in the middle of everything at the beginning to get you hooked, but right now I’m just confused. \nI didn\'t write a script or anything\nThat already is a huge red flag. If you don\'t even know where the story is going, how do you expect the reader to follow what\'s going on. If you want to make a cohesive story, you need to at least create the groundwork.\nWho are the characters? What are they like? How do they interact with each other? Where is the plot going? What are the problems the characters are going to face? How will the characters face these problems?\nThese are all basic questions that need to have at least some sort of answer before you even start writing. Now I\'m not saying that you need to know each aspect of your story in excruciating detail, but you need to have some idea of what\'s going on, where you want things to go, and how you\'re going to get there.\nTo get to your story specifically, the dialogue feels very unnatural. It can be difficult to get speech to sound natural while also making the conversation to flow the path you want (I tend to struggle with it myself) but it\'s just something you just need to keep reading and revising until you can actually picture people having that exact conversation. Things are also jumping around like crazy. First it starts off in a forest, then a school, then somewhere with a computer, then watching TV? Overall I\'m just having a hard time following what\'s going on.\nIn terms of art style, there\'s definitely a lot that can be improved upon. I\'m not talking about how good the art work is (everyone starts somewhere and just saying ""get better"" literally helps no one), but rather how things are presented. The lineart itself is extremely messy, with lines overlapping each other or stopping abruptly. The text bubbles share the same fate, while also being difficult to distinguish from the background art. This problem is amplified by the font being difficult to read (especially when Virgil talks) due to the constantly changing font size, the poor choice of font, the weird gray border around the lettering and the sub-optimal positioning of the text relative to the speech bubble. Everything seems to clash with each other making an already hard to follow story even more difficult to follow.\nHere\'s an example of ""cleaning things up"" (I\'d recommend a larger font size as well):\ncleaned.png940x400 104 KB\n\nI\'d highly recommend you spend more time working on the story as well as your writing and art style. It looks like you\'re taking a break until December so I\'d spend that time doing a bit more planning before you continue.', 'Tahnks. And that is a lot about wat i hate about it. And i know where story was going to go. I had it all in my head. Im canceling it. It sucks soooo much. And that was the only font i could use. I am making a new comic with better art, and the story has been fully planned out. And my art style has improved a lot since then. But, i more of a writer than an artist.', ""I don't really have much to say for this one since I don't think there's too much to critique. \nAt first I wasn't a fan of the art style, but it started to grow on me as I read through the chapters. It's definitely something that's memorable and stands out. One complaint I have is that some of the text is too difficult to read, sometimes because the speech bubbles are slightly too small and sometimes because the text itself is too small. There are also a few typos here and there, but from what I've seen I don't believe English is your first language? If that's the case, it might be a good idea to find someone who's willing to proofread your work before posting it.\nThe story itself has started off fairly slow. I enjoyed the characters as well as their interactions, but the first two chapters didn't have me hooked. Chapter 3 was when the main plot finally started kicking in and made me scroll to read the next chapter, not because I was reading it for a review but because I actually wanted to see what was going to happen next!"", ""Honestly I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to be reviewing here. Like you mentioned, this is more of you testing geometry and perspective than anything else. Since I'm not exactly good with perspective drawing myself, I'm definitely not the guy you want to be hearing feedback from. There's also no story right now for me to critique. If you'd like, you should post again when you have more to show off!"", ""Oh thank you. And yeah I had a feeling, chapter 3 is where things are are supposed to really get started. 1-2 are just to show locations we are defiantly going to see again, I even had to shorten the 2nd from its initial length so, yeah, I'm glad it picks up at my preferred point.\nLanguage in genreal..is not my skills, but I don't really have anyone interested to proof read except for myself but maybe I can find some one reliable. Im glad you enjoyed what I have so far."", 'Since you asked me to, I won\'t hold back with this review.\nFrom what I\'ve seen so far, the art style is really cool. An issue I have with the art itself is the action scenes. The movement feels very stiff and lacked ""omph"" in some panels (examples 16 24) where it felt like the characters were posing rather than fighting. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed that the comic isn\'t in full colour, but I understand that doing 2 coloured pages a week probably isn\'t the most feasible time-wise. I would\'ve suggested considering moving to a 1 coloured page a week release schedule, but that brings me to the next problem.\nWe\'re currently 47 pages into the story and almost nothing has happened. We\'ve gotten some character interactions with the two MCs, a short fight scene, a little bit of lore, and an arm wrestling competition with the frog man. Part 2 has seemed to have gotten better in the fact that things seem to be speeding up a bit, but it can be a big problem if you want to have an active and engaged audience as you\'re making the story. Take episode 5 to 9 for example. You used 10 pages to show a fight scene which could have probably fit in 5 or 6. This can be seen with episode 15 as well where you use 2 full pages to introduce a new town. Now this isn\'t too much of a problem if you care more about what people think about the final product rather than what they think as you\'re creating it, but it\'s important to keep a balance if you want people to enjoy the process.\nLooking at the typesetting, (apparently I\'m a stickler about it since I seem to somehow mention it in every review I\'ve given so far) there are a few panels7 where the text isn\'t center aligned. This seems like it was done purposely since there are other panels where the text aligned, but I\'m not too sure why. I don\'t know if this is just a me thing, but the text feels jarring when it\'s not.\nFinally getting to the story, the plot seems fairly generic right now. From what\'s been said so far, it can be summed up as ""two people on a journey to find a magical person"". That\'s not to say that it\'ll be like that in the future; it\'s just that nothing has really jumped out at me so far saying ""you should read this"" - especially considering we\'re almost 50 pages in. Plot aside, the characterization and and interactions have been fun to read. I\'ve especially enjoyed the facial expression they have during dialogue.\nOverall, my biggest complaint with the comic right now is the pacing. The art is good, the characters are enjoyable, but the plot seems like it hasn\'t moved past the starting line. As it stands, it\'d be a series that I wouldn\'t actively follow and instead pop back every few months to see what\'s happened.', ""This was really helpful! I was a little worried about pacing before, but didn't edit anything because I felt everything needed to be how it was for a better end product. The action could definitely be cut down though, which I never really thought about! The posing criticism is very helpful too! I'll try to add panel build-up so that I can add more of an impact to the blows. Hopefully it'll make sense why the things that happened happened and I've intentionally made it slow-paced to build to something; however, that doesn't immediately excuse the issue of getting 50 pages in without a feeling of gratifying progression, so I'm glad you told me. On the typesetting issue, that was just an unintentional mistake haha. I'm also surprised you actually complimented the art, because that was what I was worried about the most! Thank you for the criticism, I really appreciate that you took time out of your day to help me improve!"", 'Since you didn\'t mention the art in things you want to be critiqued, I\'ll make this section brief. As I mentioned with DiscountedArtist, the art itself isn\'t too important when creating gag/comedy comics since it\'s just a tool used to tell a joke. However, the art is what\'s used to initially get a viewer. I\'d recommend tidying up certain aspects, mainly the typesetting. The text is unnecessarily difficult to read (look into Wild Words if you want something that looks cleaner), sometimes overlaps with the speech bubble3, and sometimes changes colour2 for no  real reason. There are even times where the speech bubbles themselves are positioned out of order1. When positioning the bubbles, you need to take into account the readers ""path"" through the panels.\nAs for the story/humour, I can\'t say I\'m a fan of it. It seems like a lot of the jokes revolved around puns which isn\'t always a bad thing (I actually like puns), but everything in moderation. Many of them felt forced which comes across as cheesy rather than funny. The non-pun jokes also fell flat with me. There were some good jokes in there (episode 92, the Betsie joke from episode 11, episode 16), but I honestly wouldn\'t have reached those if it wasn\'t for me sticking around to review the series. \nI can\'t really critique the story itself since as you mentioned, it\'s just snippets of the characters lives. Since you said SoL was one of your genres, maybe consider putting your characters in places/situations that the user can relate to? That makes it easier for the reader to connect to the character since you can ""put yourselves in their shoes"". You kind of did that with the COVID ""arc"", but I would choose a topic that isn\'t beaten to death since it\'s literally all you hear about right now.\nThe characters themselves are fairly one-dimensional. They seem to have a single defining trait that encompasses their entire character and the jokes are based off of that. The only character that had any sort of real ""development"" was Cassie, which went from someone who was annoyed at the beavers insensitivity to one who played along with the jokes (which happened completely in chapter 2). I wouldn\'t really worry about character development at the beginning of a comedy comic though. Most people come for the jokes, so I\'d say to focus on those before you start building complex characters. When you\'ve laid down the fundamentals and feel like it\'s time to spice things up, then you should start looking in to giving the characters more depth.', ""After reading what you have so far, I can't really think of any feedback I can give you. I liked the art, the dialogue flowed nicely, each character had their own personality which showed by the way they talked and acted, and panel layout was great! The story hasn't developed much yet so I can't give a critique on it yet, but you did an amazing job with the world building thus far. Just make sure you've developed enough of the story so that you don't lose direction of where you want to go as you get further into it.\nThe one piece of advice I can think of is to advertise your comic more whether it be on here, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, your local supermarket - anywhere really. I'm sure there's a lot of people who'd be interested in seeing where this story goes."", 'I always like to hear what people think of my comic, so I\'d be grateful if you\'d give it a review!\nSynopsis: In the distant future, humanity has conquered the stars and colonized the galaxy.

So, I've just newly published my novel Vestimortis, and I was wondering if anyone has the time to read and share their thoughts of it–it has around 6 chapters up right now (but they're pretty short with around 4319 words in total).

The chapters really have the right amount of description and dialogue, but one thing I noticed about the dialouge is that sometimes they're too formal. I expected that from Ryvan since he's the sole heir, but I feel like the others–his friends somehow sounded formal too, and Taren. Sometimes he sounds like Ryvan in a way, but sometimes there's some certain roughness to his tone. One of the things that stuck out to me was the way Ryvan introduced himself as the heir to Nightingale Corporation–the 'I'm sure you've heard' and 'how rude of me' sounded a tiny bit arrogant, probably because of his upbringing, but yeah.

I have a tiny bit of extra time this weekend, so I would like to open up one of these again! As the title says, I will like, comment, and read the first fifteen chapters of your story (and critique them if you want) if you read, like, and comment on the first 10 of mine (I am definitely looking for critiques again)!
Alright, so I just got done with a big edit for my story, Inheritance, and I want to know how the first ten chapters read--so that's the purpose of this thread! And, of course, I like giving back so I will do the same for the first 5 people to comment on this thread! That being said, here are some basic rules:

I will only do this with the first five people to comment. If I see that you are not reciprocating my likes/comments/reads, I will give you two reminders. After that, I will give your spot to someone else. That being said, you don't have to start reciprocating until I actually start reading and liking yours. It's only fair!
This is only for novels, however, I am open to doing this with comics if no one with a novel comments. XD
If you would like a critique, tell me beforehand and I will PM you with it once I've read through the first 10 chapters of your story or I will leave it on this thread.

Are you a new writer or comic artist? I may not be great at reviewing, but I'll try to give an honest opinion on your first few chapters. I can post it here, or if you prefer, I'll send a message.I won't immediately have reviews out, so take your finger off the F5 button.
I'll be using a simple format, Beating you with a stick(Criticism), then giving the carrot(Compliments).If you are interested, please fill this form:
Story Link:Genre:Word Count per Chapter: (I'm setting the limit to 5000 words per novel review. For comics, I'm not sure, but I'll at least read 10 or more panels.) —Note: If you want me to read more, you would have to read the same amount of extra words from my story and leave a comment on each chapter.  (1000 words per chapter)Details: (Explain why you need help, or which parts you would like me to direct my criticism)Anything else:
This review is for free, but I will use this opportunity to promote. You don't have to read my novel, but it would consider reviewing your work sooner if you do.This is not first come first serve. I choose the order. But obviously, if you want me to read more than the limited word count, you have to read the story anyway. I will not do your review until you finish your part in that case.

In the part where Laurel hypnotizes Luke to stab himself, it wasn\'t immediately clear to me that it was her that did so. Now in the dialogue, ""Now, let\'s make some chaos"" If you give ""chaos"" a different fontstyle, in the following panels, it\'ll be more obvious that Luke was hypnotized if you use the same said font style with, ""Do as I say, my boy.""—This is just a tip that you can apply on further chapters. So that readers won\'t be confused as much when you shift scenes.\nFor the plot, I feel like I\'m reading an already established world, which can be both a good and bad thing. New readers familiar with Norse Mythology can establish a connection with your story, but readers unfamiliar would find difficulty.A new character keeps getting introduced every few panels, and as I\'ve said above, people familiar with mythology would recognize them and form a connection. Most readers, however would be asking a recurring question, ""Who is this again?""  Unsure if the character had appeared already, or if they are a new addition. It\'s hard to keep track of all their names.This isn\'t such a huge problem, but it limits your available readers. It feels tiring to keep being introduced to people with their own speaking roles. I don\'t really care much for them since they would only appear in 1 episode, or worse, just a few panels.\nYou want help making your comic look more professional?There\'s a lot of work to be done, honestly. And I\'m sure you\'re aware of that. Instead of reading a thick wall of text from me, I suggest watching videos on youtube.David Revoy - Comic from A to Z1 - Author of Pepper and CarrotNot that I\'m running away from giving you help, but delegating. I\'ve watched David Revoy\'s video a few times, and it was really insightful. I believe some, if not all, of his tips would work for you.\nCompliments: Here\'s your carrot!Your story was easy to read and the dialogue was fluid. I also found your art style really endearing, that\'s why I was a bit surprised at the sudden plot twist in the beginning.Although simple, you showed your character\'s emotions well in your drawing.I could see your story becoming a full-blown comic, you only need to work on improving yourself. Your art style as it now appears to just be the skeleton of what could be a good comic in the future.\nDessert:The amount of work you may have to put through, don\'t be intimidated by it. Feel the thirst for improvement. Go and pick up more knowledge for art. The youtube video I sent to you is just one of many that could guide you.', ""Thanks, I'll give the video a watch."", ""Last bit of advice, don't take it that you have to have great art skills to make a good comic. I liked your art. You just have to build up on it.

"", 'Title : Jinsei: ResonateAuthor : @Lahin Notes:  Please tell me if it\'s flowing well. And if there are moments that stick outStatus: Episode 9\nCriticism: Prepare yourself.After the clock strikes four, the second sentence hits me. Long, too long to take in immediately.  Which makes it hard to understand.—During storytelling, like when Isamu told his story about the silhouette to Mareo, instead of cutting the chapter and switching into full 1st person, you could continue it in 3rd person dialogue.(This part felt a bit like exposition, I had to read it over a few times) Where sometimes Mareo interjects with his thoughts about the story. As well as input of external factors to give the reader slight rest and immersion. I\'m talking about Integrating Dialogue into Scenes.—Some of your sentences and dialogue feel a bit long-winded. You don\'t actually have to state every action your character takes or sees. For example, on this part here, \nA few minutes later, Isamu agitatedly returns to the entrance, and without looking to see if the silhouette is there, he runs towards the swing facing the ground. Huffing and noticing it is empty, he pulls out his earphones with a gasp, ""Where was the person sitting here!?""\nNotice how much I cut out? This paragraph starts with a long sentence, and continued with two sentences that could be just a single one. Adding to that, ""Someone was sitting here right now. I\'ve got to find that person!"" You\'ve already built up that he was looking for the person in the silhouette. Keep it crisp. No need to say it again.—Avoid making repeated use of a word in a paragraph, dialogue, or both. Like mentioning Silhouette three or four times within two paragraphs(including the dialogue.) Try to make use of nuances or synonyms to imply certain words to  avoid repetition.——Yup it got considerably better past episode 1. But I\'ll still leave the criticism on there. A recurring problem I see is during dialogue. Just pure back and forth dialogue, without having the scene fleshed out. I feel like I\'m listening to two people talking in a podcast (around episode 5). It actually breaks my immersion when narration comes in. I suggest you flesh out your scenes a bit more.\nFor moments that stick out : Can\'t say that there is an event that sticks to mind, although episode 2,3 and 4 kind of did, since although short, they were easy to read.\nComplements: Here\'s your carrotI like how your characters interact, they don\'t seem stiff at all. Around episode 9, you seemed to have gotten into a comfortable spot with your writing, which is good. The force is flowing well at this point.And you\'re explanations and Japanese tidbits at the end are a good touch. Since I believe not all readers on the platform are Nihon Savvy.\nDesserts: I don\'t know if past episode 9 it gets obvious, but the theme of the story kind of eludes me. Whether it may be comedy or romance, I don\'t see yet where it\'s headed. But I do see slice of life.\nA big fix which I\'ll be suggesting is that you rewrite episode 1, from memory. (Sounds hard but it really isn\'t.)Write it as you remember it, add a few tweaks you feel is worth adding.Keep in mind my criticism, as well as your greatly improved writing. And that link, Integrating Dialogue into Scenes, as it works incredibly well with Slice of Life.When you\'re done, place them side by side. Fill in some gaps, and see the difference. I trust it will be to your liking.', ""Thank you so much for the feedback!  This honestly helps a lot!!!\nYes, the main genre is slice of life. The story is basically just sol. The comedy is what I felt comfy with and romance... well... I'll just keep it in as a third genre.  \nThank you again, for help on ep 1. That last idea of writing it from memory might be what I needed!  I will try implementing it! Much love. Lahin.\nPS: I might continue reading your story tho. It kinda piqued my interest. I'll see you there, I guess."", ""Story: An Unwritten HistoryAuthor: BluehoodieStatus: Episode 11\nCriticism: I can't beat you with a stick, I just can't.The story skips a bit, and the dialogue feels blocky. I feel that you could improve more on your pacing and dialogue.For your art, I suggest a bit of practice with drawing body templates and skeletons. Not literal skeletons, I mean improving more on the basics of drawing. \nCompliment: Have all the carrots I've got!I enjoyed the simplicity of your work. Although I'm sure it wasn't your intention, it was endearing( I mean it.)\nDesserts: Please do keep making comics. I can feel your desire to make a story.

17,"Looking for feedback on a 6-page Short Comic Script (Survival, Sci-Fi)",Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey! I've written a 6-page short comic script, and I'd be very grateful if you beta-read it for me! if you'd like me to beta-read your comic script in return, I'm down!Note: this script doesn't include the character descriptions because I put them in a separate document.
The Premise:
When the lively and hopeful Tara finds herself stranded in a mind-bending alien realm, she must conquer its unknown dangers to survive. But is surviving a replacement for being happy?
I tried to make use of the 9-panel grid here, so I'd like to know what you thought about it. Did it help, or hinder? what about the pacing that it gives the story? what do you think of the pacing of the story in general?I'd also like to know your opinion of page 1 in particular since I struggled with it. is it paced well? is it a good hook? does it do a good job presenting Tara as a likable character?and lastly, would you be interested in reading a longer story based on this?
Even if you don't have anything to say about any of these questions, I'd appreciate all feedback! thank you!
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zh9722xeZBe01zQ8Gk5hFmCrd65b4Hyg/view?usp=sharing6","[""Hi!I read all of it, and the general idea is nice. The whole concept of live against just survive it always hit on a society that struggle with that same problem.Still, I have some issues. I found myself wondering who is Tara, and why can she adapt into this world. I mean, if she is completely alien to this world, as in, she could be my neighbour, and suddenly appeared on this scenary, how come that she did not panic, and started running, and screaming for help before realizing where she is? I needed the culture shock before the 'oh, okay let's survive'. Now, that could be because she is not our average neighbour, but then, if she is more resourfoul, then why she cracks at the beginning, just to get over it on the same page?On the other hand, if she is more learned on this alien world (I don't even know if she is human), I could accept more her actions. But I don't get even a description of her clothes to assume that she is trained for survival situations.\nPassing this, you also must describe the searcher. I didn't understood what it was, and I suppose that its edible because she later eated one, but for most of the scenes I thought that it was a machine. I had to go back and readed with other image on my mind.\nThe little cliffhangers to go from page to page are nice. You got the concept for that nailed.\nOne last little adjustment would be the dialogue for Tara. Okay, she is alone, and to feel less alone she may talk to herself. That's not the problem. The problem I have is that, why would she think that she is happy? The exact lines are 'I can't live here! If I do I won't be happy! I'll just... survive', and I thought that it was very sappy. Of course she won't be happy if she was used to other kind of life before, but we don't know nothing of that. There is nothing to compare, not even a line of what she might be missing. You need to make a connection, a metaphor or reference for what she might want to be happy, and that she obviously don't have on this land that she tamed, Just then, she can be moved to go to find other lands and maybe a way out of this predicament and find happiness.\nThat's my review for your script!Hope you find it useful!"", 'Thanks for the detailed review! it\'s super helpful! I\'m glad you liked the idea!\nabout page 1, I felt like the whole ""culture shock"" aspect of Tara finding herself there wouldn\'t contribute much to the story - it wouldn\'t teach you much about Tara other than that she\'s a normal person, since anyone would have that kind of reaction. so the idea was that page 1 is set after she has that freakout, when she\'s trying to calm herself down. seems like I need to make that more clear.\nAs for character descriptions, I usually write them in another document. I should have stated that in the post, that\'s absolutely my bad. the scanners are supposed to be like monsters, essentially this place\'s equivalent to dangerous predators.', 'Yeah, I thought after posting that the character sheets with the charas information where in another place, and would resolve some of my doubts, but it was too late to rewrite everything xD\nHope to see more if this later =D', 'should I send this to you once Its drawn and posted?(if I remember by then lmao)', ""Yeah, sure!Most of the time, once it's drawn and written, the feel it's completely different from the script, so yeah!

21,What kind of vibes does this plot description give off (and what could I do to make it better)?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So, I recently started seriously working on a short-ish graphic novel that I plan to publish eventually (here, of course). I just finished writing the as of now final draft of the plot description and I'd appreciate if a few people could tell me what they would think of my story based on it. Of course, if there's any way you feel that I could improve it, I'd be happy to hear that too.
Plot Description

'In the surreal town of Ingoun, curious ghost girl Noa spends her evenings sending messages past the area’s border into the unknown world outside; a world long forgotten by the other residents.
She never expected to gain anything from this, so she’s naturally very surprised when she actually receives a message back one night. Compelled to continue communicating with this mysterious recipient, Noa begins trying to discover the secret of what lies beyond Ingoun from them.'

More of "" She\'s surprised""\n""\'In the surreal town"" Surreal?\n""Noa begins trying"" One or the other, both sound weird.\n""discover the secret of what lies beyond Ingoun from them.\' A bit too generic but it works.', 'Got it. Thank you for your input!', ""That's a fun start. It's definitely giving off whimsical, spooky, mystery, adventure vibes. \nQuick question- are you looking for a critique on your plot summary? Or a critique of the future plot of your book (as a whole)?\nIf you're looking for input on the future plot of the book I have a few more questions:1) Does a majority of the story take place in Inguon? Or does it lead to an adventure outside its borders? (if it leads to adventure, I'd state that upfront in the plot). 2) Who else lives in Inguon? How might they feel about Noa looking into this mystery?3) Is there an antagonist? Are they worth mentioning in the plot?4) What dangers become apparent to the reader early on (to include in the plot)?\nThat's about it. But it sounds fun, for sure."", 'Added an edit. I like the setting btw.', '\n\narxianfall:\n""\'In the surreal town"" Surreal?\nI was looking at this too, and thinking ""isolated"" instead? Let the surrealism be self evident, or find another place to work that in, IMO. =)\nStory sounds very sweet to me, by the way.', ""Thank you! I wasn't really looking for any massive criticism, but here are the answers to your questions: \n1) No, the entire story takes place in Ingoun.\n2) There are three major characters aside from Noa in Ingoun. One is a guardian, another is a longtime friend and the third is a killer phantom that's trying to befriend her.\n3) There are some antagonists here and there that definitely get in the way of Noa's actions (such as other phantoms) but the story will mainly focus on the messaging element and the mystery of what is beyond Ingoun.\n4) The phantoms. They want to devour Noa.\nIf you have any other advice, then I'd be happy to hear it. Once again, thanks."", ""By surreal, I meant twisted and weird, as in the buildings and other landmarks are literally warped and definitely not in the right place. Ghosts are everywhere and the inhabitants are mainly bizarre creatures. I guess I'll be looking into MC Escher and Dali's stuff to find inspiration for how this place will look.\nBut I can definitely see what you're saying and I'll work on it. Thanks."", 'That\'s really cool. Maybe Paragraph One should be establishing the city, and paragraph two can establish Noa and her messages? The current description is pretty concise, so you wouldn\'t be bloating it if you did. It\'s not necessary or anything. I just think otherwise ""isolated"" (or similar) has more impact than ""surreal"" under the current description. Again, I do like what you have, and it\'s not like reading ""surreal city"" verses ""isolated city"" would actually turn me off reading something interesting! Consider this nit picking. =)', ""Awesome. Sounds fun and like a nice opportunity to do some great character work. Keeping it to one location can be really introspective for your main character, allowing you to play with a lot of great themes (like dealing with isolation, finding purpose, etc). I'm excited to see where it goes.""]",7/28/2021 13:19,https://forums.tapas.io/t/what-kind-of-vibes-does-this-plot-description-give-off-and-what-could-i-do-to-make-it-better/62261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chaus: Dawn of a New Age | Tapas
In a world filled with magic, dragons, and unimaginable occurrences, lives Chaus. Chaus was living a peaceful life in his village, but one night, Chaus's entire village was massacared. No one was left alive except for Chaus. A mysterious creature...





","['I\'m only going to give feedback over the first few episodes and the most recent if that\'s alright. I can be blunt and harsh, but thorough, so if that\'s not what want to hear skip to the end for the overview.\nThe blunt but in-depth bit\nThe first thing that sticks out to me is how flatly written the blurb is. Not only is story seemingly  little cliché (something that\'s understandably hard to overcome when writing fantasy for the first time), but it\'s also written in passive voice.\n""In a world filled with magic, dragons, and unimaginable occurrences, lives Chaus. <--- this sentence would have been a great opportunuty to explain a little bit about the character, how old he is, what race, meaning fantasy race, he is, etc. Chaus was living a peaceful life in his village What\'s the name of his village?, but one night, Chaus\'s entire village was massacred. <--- I think the issue with this line, at least for me, is that it doesn\'t mention anyone important to Chais, like family or friends, or, on the other end, it doesn\'t mention who massacured the village. No one was left alive except for Chaus. <---This line is redundant. A mysterious creature takes Chaus in and decides to teach Chaus. Chaus beings his journey to take revenge on those that slaughtered his village, but along the way, he encounters a much more terrifying truth. Filled with beautiful love, uncontrollable vengeance, heaven shattering power, and unexpected twists, this is Chaus: Dawn of a New Age.""_\nThe rest of the blurb is pretty okay, it\'s just that things are pretty vague and distant, meaning there\'s not much to intrigue the reader into choosing this book over others. Also, there are a few typos in there as well that might also deter some potential readers. It sounds like it could be interesting, however.\nEpisode 1\nI\'m going to be honest, you already lost me in the first three paragraphs. Not lost in terms of confusion, but in terms of enjoyment. You start with the massacre having happened and then quickly cut to thirty minutes prior without building any tension.\nThe first paragraph fine, but suffers from passive voice so it doesn\'t flow as well. The second paragraph which focused on Chaus should have been expanded on to build suspense. Introduce an assailant that\'s walking around the room Chaus is under and his close to finding him. Explain more about how Chaus is reacting physiologically: his shallow breaths, his beating heart, his trembling hands. Really get into how he\'s feeling so when you cut away from that scene, your readers are left wanting to go back and to see the outcome. \nYou use a lot of filler words like in the sentence, ""Richard came over and also started hugging Chaus"" Instead of ""started hugging"", you could just say hugged. Or if you don\'t want to use the same word: squeezed, embraced, and enveloped are all better options that would have given some emotion to the scene.\nAnd also there\'s a flatness and nondescript aspect to your writing. You don\'t go into detail about locations or how characters are feeling. We know the name of the kingdom, but not the village. We don\'t know what the village looks like, if the streets are bustling and filled with ""vitality"". The writing comes off as generic and uninteresting because nothing is explained that would set it apart.\n""Chaus went straight to his hiding spot with a smile. Soon he would be able to eat his favorite desert."" Are a bit of a redundant pair of lines, and you\'re missing a comma after the Soon.\nThere\'s a repetitiveness in your diction, word choice, and syntax, sentence structure. You keep reusing Soon at the start of your sentences, so they all blend together. And repetitive sentences are boring sentences, your not keeping your readers on their toes. This episode was supposed to be sad and suspenseful and dramatic, but in my opinion it was none of those things. We don\'t spend any time getting to know the village or Chaus\'s parents so when they die, it\'s not meaningful to the readers. You can only sympathize with someone, or a character, you don\'t know so far. Keep this in mind going forward, if you want your audience to feel bad for a character, you need to establish them first.\nEpisode 2\nWhy ""Sharp, jagged teeth could be seen in the creature\'s mouth""? \nWhy not: ""Sharp jagged teeth protruded out of the creature\'s cave like mouth and hung over its bottom jaw like stalactites."" \nI realize that only so many expectations can be had when being new at writing, or to any skill, but I think diction and syntax are the biggest things to focus on for you. I can only say so much on what is written, the story, but the way everything is written so, not bad, but flat and uninteresting. If there is something beneath the surface of this plot, it\'s hard to tell if your writing style would be able to bring it forward. \nAnother thing the flat descriptions are indicating that you are prone to telling the reader things rather than showing the reader things. There will always be a time for telling, there are things that just need to be explained to your reader. As a rule of thumb, the emotions of major characters should be shown. You get away with saying something short about the feelings of the one off or unimportant characters, but if we\'re going to be spending any time with them, we better know how they feel/react to things. Descriptions are also showing the readers things, as opposed to telling them. It\'s a matter of striking a balance.\nChaus\'s reaction to the confirmation that his entire village is dead and that he will never go home or see his parents again is really... cold. Especially for a nine-year-old who was seemingly attached to his parents. Not a single tear, a dry heave, A GASP?! Does he care? And you might say, ""Oh well he\'s going to avenge his parents and fight some Zikis."" Okay... Maybe he cares enough to be mad, but not enough to be sad? He\'s not even desperate to go back to see his parents again or try find the Ziki as he is to get revenge. It\'s so calculating and boring because YOU DON""T WRITE ANY EMOTION INTO THE SCENE! Should I even feel bad for the nine-year-old who lost his whole village? That is a question you  don\'t want your readers to ask!\nThe paragraph where Dru transported Chaus into the room of fire was pretty good. Unfortunately, it is followed by a big unbroken paragraph of exposition. Again, there will always be space for telling the reader things, but if you are giving a lot of information, break up the dialogue with narrative, another character speaking, or literally formatting all the text into the separate paragraphs. Another problem with the exposition paragraph is that, it introduces things and explains them, like the multiple stages (which don\'t seem to be important right now. Why wouldn\'t you leave the rest past the first one to be explained when it\'s relevant?), but also introduces other things, like magi (singular magus) without explaining what those are. I know they mean magician or wizard, but the uninitiated will not. So, be careful about what you\'re explaining.\nYou say in this line. ""Chaus wanted to give up and leave this hell, but if he did, he could never face his dead family or village."" \nBut why though? I mean, I know why, but you haven\'t explained that to me over the course of these two episodes. He made no promises to his family or himself. He\'s nine! What are they expecting out of him? What\'s he expecting out of himself? Chaus doesn\'t read like a nine-year-old. He does a little at the start, but throughout the second episode, he sounding more and more like an older teenager or young adult. \nHooray! another paragraph of seemingly irrelevant exposition. I\'m not saying the information about the stages is unimportant, it\'s just a lot of info all at once without much connection to the narrative. You\'re better off explain what the stages of each thing are when and if Chaus reaches them. And you use the same descriptor, ""stage"", to describe the different levels of soul formation and Hellfire. That\'s super confusing as a reader to separate, especially when those paragraph are so close to one another, so I recommend changing one of them to something else: phase, degree, and level are all good options.\nIt\'s kinda unfortunate that these stages that Chaus needs to pass through occur so quickly without much struggle. I mean he does struggle, but it\'s very much glanced over. The concept is introduced within the same episode that he surpasses two of them. Make of that what you will...\nEpisode 3\nSo, I\'m only going to talk about this for a bit. We still don\'t know who this kid is. What he looks like, his hobbies, personality traits. Is he funny? Smart? Charismatic? Charitable? I couldn\'t tell you.\nEpisode 15\nAgain I\'m not going to go into too much detail here. I skipped most of the story to get to this episode, so I can\'t really speak on that. But it seems like, for the most part, the issues I\'ve had so far, still linger. Passive voice, uninteresting or no descriptions, narrow diction and repetitive syntax, too much and confusing exposition.\n\nOverview\nOverall, I think you need to work on your syntax and your diction. Vary your sentences and structure your formatting to depth to the literature. Crack open a thesaurus when you edit. I personally have thesaurus.com listed as a bookmark in chrome. And try not to write in passive voice. Remove filler words like ""had"", ""did"", and ""began"" where you can so that the literature flows better. \nWrite descriptions! Of locations, of characters, of emotions and movement. And when you do write them make them more interesting! Use figures of speech: simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, etc. to vary descriptions and make them more or less important, depending on detail. \nShow vs Tell. You need to find a balance in telling something to your reader vs showing. A good rule of thumb for me is if an exposition scene is going on for too long, I like to break it up with narrative, whether that be another character interrupting or a flashback. And if I am expositing, I try to make thing more interesting through character emotion.\nYour characterization for Chaus in the first few episodes is lacking. We don\'t know what kind of person this kid is, other than he\'s quick to jump off the grieving train and quick to jump on the revenge train, which is strange for a child unless he has a personality disorder. But don\'t quote me on that.\nLastly, at least a little bit, it feels like you\'re using writing a fantasy novel as an excuse to show off the mechanics of your magic system. It\'s fine if you want to do that, but it needs to be more interesting if people are going to care. \nThat\'s all I have! Sorry if it came off a bit harsh, my intention isn\'t to hurt your feelings but to get you thinking like a storyteller. I do think this story could be interesting, it\' just need work. Good luck to you and your story! ', ""Thank you so much for taking the time to give me feedback! I'll work on the things you suggested and try to improve my writing as much as I can.

And now... THE RULES!

Only submit when there are slots open. I accept groups of 5 at a time. If you missed a chance at a slot and want a ping when I'm opening them again, post to say that or PM me. Occasionally I'll give an extra 6th slot to a deserving person who keeps missing slots. If somebody gets one of these, they usually deserve it. Don't ask for one.
Submit ONE Tapas comic. No novels (there are other threads for that). I'd prefer to read on Tapas over Webtoons if you're hosted on both. I'd really prefer Tapas only but... rgh I'm too softhearted to rule other platforms out completely because I do understand webtoons apparently has no forum (boo! Forums for life!).
Your comic must have at least a cover and either five episodes or equivalent to 5 print pages worth (assuming a ""page"" is approx 4+ panels) of content.
I will not re-review comics I reviewed last thread. But I will review new comics by people who had comics reviewed last thread if they meet the page count.
I don't do private reviews via PM or email.
I reserve the right to decline to review any comic. I've so far not needed to do this, but in the case of extreme nudity, gore or disturbing themes, I might decide I'm not the right person for the job because I'm sensitive to that kind of thing.
Other people in the thread are welcome to review comics I decline, or to follow up with advice directed at helping those reviewed so long as they keep it in the helpful and positive spirit of the thread (In the last thread, everyone was great! Good job, peeps!).

These are creator-facing reviews intended to give you guidance and direction to make your comic more market-friendly and hopefully boost your comic's ability to be discovered and to pick up subs and maintain audience engagement. They are not audience-facing reviews designed to tell you what's a good comic to read. I'd recommend the reviews more for people stuck under 250 subs because they'll get the most out of it. 
The criticism of your comic is not a criticism of you as a person and your comic's sub numbers don't tally your value as a human being. It is 100% okay to feel upset after a review, because I know criticism is a bitter pill to swallow. I always feel upset after reviews and criticism and usually need to cry it out in a dark room for a while before I can respond in a professional and polite way!  So just know that I am entirely sympathetic to this. I'm on your side. I respect the hard work you've put in regardless of your experience and ability level. So please take the critique like a grown up and be polite. You don't have to agree with what I advise you to do, but please keep your mind open to change and don't flame me out or be dismissive of everything I say after I've spent hours going through your comic making notes. You know what to expect from the last thread. You will probably not be the magical exception for whom I have no criticism. I will try to help you as best I can and be nice and compliment you when you've done good, but it may be a bit like a trip to the dentist.
And with that... LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS!

24,Offering Critical and Honest Reviews for Comics (Closed),Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, I am Sera. 
See below for my works/credentials I guess?
Sera's info
I'm the Creator of Swaha and Bone's Tarot on Tapas. Links in my bio. Also I am a contracted Artist for Studio Tapas where I'm an Editor, Script assistant, and Art assistant. I got my BFA degree in Animation and have been making comics to post online since 2015 and freelancing since 2011. I have experience in studying story, art and thinking critically about what works and what doesn't.

I felt like offering some reviews for things people might find helpful. 
Here's what I'll review: Your cover, your comic summary, and the first act, arc, or scene of your comic. I'll focus on the Art, dialogue Bubble legibility, and storytelling.
I will not review Comics that don't have at least one full story segment/scene because the review will not be useful to you if I cannot see how you progress through a beginning, middle and end. 
Unfortunately this means I will not be helpful for slice of life/gag comics. Only comics that have a short or long form storyline/narrative please.
I will be polite but I will not sugar coat or hedge at anything.
The content of your comic may not my cuppa tea, but the clarity and skill with which you tell the story is what I will focus on and review.
Stuff I need from you if you want a review (if you don't follow these, I will not provide a review):

1/ Your nickname - how would you like me to refer to you?
2/ link to your comic's info page. So I can see the cover and summary before the first page. (In case you need to find the info page: click on your comic then click on the cover from the sidebar. URL should have your comic title followed by ""info"")
3/ The number of episodes that covers your Act 1/First arc, or what you believe to be your first scene. This is what I will read (within reason)

I'm on vacation so I'll be able to read and review sporadically for a few days then cut off on Monday cause I'll be going back to work then. Any requests for reviews that come on Monday, I will not have time to do, I apologize. Depending on the volume, I may set a cutoff post sometime Sunday.
First come first served in the order of correctly formatted posts.
I reserve the right not to review a comic if I feel I can't be helpful/ it doesn't have enough content to review reasonably past the advice ""Keep going."" 
I also reserve the right to be wrong. If you feel my review is unhelpful or incorrect to your intents for the comic, feel free to tell me to stuff it, ignore my review, and go along your merry way. In no way am I a master storyteller, but I do have experience, a fair bit of success, and will give you my most honest and critically-thought-out feedback.
That said, cheers and I wish everyone the best of luck creating good stories and good art.","[""Hello this is my comic Eternal mist.\nYou can call me Nossumy.\nhttps://tapas.io/series/Eternal-mist7\nFirst arc is until episode 8 or maybe even before that it's hard to tell."", ""Wooow these types of threads are usually crawling with people by now.  I don't normally respond to these since I don't like trying to get people to read my comic, but since you're only doing the first act, summary and cover I'm not too bothered by it.  I could always improve my summary and whatnot.\nBefore I post my info I have to let you know about a couple things.  The part you will be reading was draw in 2015 and post in 2016, so it's ooold.  The cover better reflects my current visual... art... stuff, and my speech bubbles have improved a bit since then.  Also, even though the first act of my comic is super chill compared to the rest, it still has a few things I need to warn about: Non-sexual full frontal nudity, substance abuse, implied suicide, child abuse, injury and profanity.

","[""5 things. \nTens- you shift in and out of past and present tense a lot. In your writing you should try to stick to one or the other . The most common that writers us is past tense. \nExplain as you go- I get that you have to explain things so readers understand what is going on, but I think you have a lot of opportunities to explain information as the story goes, rather than information dumping. As a general rule, if I have to info dump, I try to keep it constrained to a single paragraph. If I have multiple paragraphs of info dumping I try to break them up so my story doesn't feel like a history lesson.\nThe flow- I think while your sentences work grammatically, they could be better in they way they read. Some of your sentences feel like run on sentences, and others feel like they wouldn't role off the tongue very well. \nDialog- I think the character Dialog is a little hard to believe in specific places. They say things that make sense, but the way they say them feels unnaturally scripted. \nTypos- you have quite a few. \nThat being said, I found the story interesting and it has a lot of potential."", ""Take anything I ever say with grains of salt as I am no means an expert or very nice about anything.\nIt's immediately off-putting that your first two real sentences of the GIGANTIC paragraph immediately argue.

Mainly because I wanted to explain as much about the world as I could in the beginning, again I didn\'t have a solid outline for how I wanted the first few parts(everything before episode 6) to go, and the biggest culprit, my inexperience.

27,Needing opinons,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey! I'm currently still on my first novel but I'm already thinking about a future project. I'd love to share the plot and title, and get feedback on it!
Title: Lucid Dreams
Year 3045, the game industry has come to the point of letting you control your dreams (or Lucid Dreaming). It is tough to explain how it works, but we are now at the point where we are God of our worlds(Dreams) or able to transmigrate into other’s dreams(Online) with permission. My name is Frei, and I am the embodiment of chaos in my world. A world filled with monsters, criminals, devil worshipers, poverty, and me, the unruly Overlord. My life outside of my dreams is filled with nothing but destroyed relationships, no friends, and no family. I'd instead use the people around me than use ""trust"" as a way of getting through life. And so, when Faith Industries finally allowed us to take control of our dreams, I was nothing but filled with happiness and built my world. But for some reason, my subordinates are starting to act a little odd; it’s as if they've grown their own conscience...
""What's going on? Why am I in a field?"" 
I was killed in my dream world due to the betrayal of my creation, and the dangers of dying in your dream are what almost got Faith Industry completely shut down. You become Braindead. But for me, not ultimately, I've been sent to another person's dream world, and now I have to find my way somehow back to mine to wake up!","['So these are my thoughts on this blurb as you have it now.\n\nThe base concept has potential, the whole ""I\'m stuck in a video game"" trope is fairly popular and has been done to some great success with things like Sword Art Online. It could appeal to a big audience of people who want exactly that sort of story.\nAnyone who refers to themselves as the ""embodiment of chaos"" just screams cringe. It has the vibe of a fifteen-year-old who calls himself a badass on the internet because he bought a sword at a shop in the mall. \nIf Frei\'s real life is so awful, and in his Lucid Dream he can make his universe anything he wants, why would he make it a world of monsters and criminals and poverty? If he could make a perfect ideal world for himself, why wouldn\'t he make it something good? A place that he likes? Where he can escape from his shitty reality? If your real world is shitty, and your escape from the real world is also shitty, then what\'s the point? He claims to be happy lording it over all his thieves and prostitutes, but that speaks to a personality that doesn\'t really appeal to most people in their main character. People like the main characters they read about to be relatable and likeable, not cringey sociopaths who delight in the suffering of others.\nThe idea of being killed in a video game is cool, and his consciousness is drifting around in someone else\'s internet brain. That could be very interesting, and you could do some high-brow mental analytics of being inside someone else\'s psyche.\nFrei wants to escape this other person\'s brain internet... But escape to where? To what? His body is dead. If he went braindead at home, then his physical body will have started to decay and there will be nothing for him to return to. If he got sent to a hospital, he wouldn\'t still be connected to the internet, so there would be no connection for his mind to get back to his body. Plus if his real life is as shitty as he claims, and he has no friends or family, then he would have nobody around to tell the hospital not to pull the plug after he went braindead. The hospital would declare him deceased and move him to the morgue and his body would start to decay. A brain starts to suffer permanent irreversible damage after only about three minutes without oxygen. Even if he found a way back, he wouldn\'t have a viable body to return to.\nMore importantly... WHY does he want to go back? His life was awful. His mental paradise was awful. He has nothing to go back to, no reason to want to escape. He needs something to aim for and strive for and work towards other than just ""I want to be back in my body."" He needs something driving him and motivating him, otherwise he has no reason to want to go back to his hellish existence. And if he\'s just trying to go back to be the dark edgy evil overlord of his own sociopathic hellscape, then the readers won\'t exactly be rooting for him to succeed.\nThis story seems to be all about this one angsty guy travelling by himself. That is honestly and truly going to make for very bleak and dry and silent writing with a lot of navel-gazing and internal monologue. Either he won\'t be speaking to anyone and there will be no dialogue, which most readers won\'t sit through for long, or he\'ll be talking to himself, which is kind of boring and difficult to suffer through as a reader for long periods of time. He needs someone to speak to, to bounce conversation off of, to interact with. He needs a Samwise Gamgee. He needs a Flounder. He needs a Chewbacca. A foil character to reflect off of.\n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts on your concept so far, take it or leave it as you will. I think there are some basic characterization things you need to consider in order to make your main character likeable enough for most audiences to enjoy reading about him or want to root for him to succeed. But at the end of the day, if you aren\'t worried about appealing to an audience or gaining readers, just write whatever you want to write however you want to write it, because writing is good for the soul.\nBest of luck!', ""That is some good criticism by ninjashira. I think the main premise of the story could be about the protagonist changing for the better by experiencing hardship through other worlds. Then, in the end he might not even want to go back and just quit gaming (or lucid dreaming in this case) and become a better person. Or, just like SAO and many other isekai type stories, it could be about a corrupt system, administration, etc that the protagonist feels a responsibility to take down. This would be really interesting if you included a comedic aspect to the story, e.g. when the protagonist can't have his way, or if he randomly forgets that he is not in control anymore."", ""Here are my thoughts based on what you wrote and the comments made by ninjashira and tapiyokastudios.\n\nI think you would really have to hammer home why did Frei make his dream world is so terrible. A reason I came up with is that it seems that his dream world is a way to make himself feel powerful. His bleak reality maybe has him feeling weak or inferior and he makes a world where he can essentially take back that control by lording over people he deems lesser. The why will be important to establishing Frei's character.\nTo me, Frei sounds like he will be a villain. In my opinion, the hardest thing to do when writing a villain is making them readable. Two things that I've seen people tend to do with villains to make them more likeable is add comedy and/or make them charismatic. Or, you could do as tapiyokastudios suggested and have the story revolve around him becoming a better person. I think the best option is the one that most ties into the theme of your story (if you have one).\nI think there is way to make him braindead and still be able return to his world work. This part of the worldbuilding points out a possible way for him to return. Faith Industries were almost shut down. Unless the world of the far future got very lax in regulations, I don't see how a company could still sell a product that had the slightest possibility of its users becoming braindead. Did Faith Industries hide this consequence in order to keep selling, or did they come up with a way to save people after they became braindead? Or, did the governemnt find the benefits of lucid dreaming to be worth the risk of users becoming braindead? \n\nBAFr:\nand the dangers of dying in your dream are what almost got Faith Industry completely shut down\nI agree with ninjashira with wondering why Frei wants to go back to reality. Without a compelling goal or motivation, the story may fall flat with readers. Maybe if the story involves Frei becoming a better person, his goals can change; a non-compelling motivation can change into a compelling one. \nThis story has the potential to be very psychological, and you could make the genre kind of like a psychological thriller. Being in other people's dream worlds and interacting with their thoughts and desires could affect Frei in a plethora of ways. You could explore the consequences of the lucid dreaming technology and what effect it has had on reality. You premise allows for many avenues of thought.\n"", 'Seems a lot of difficulties could be overcome by dropping the internet gaming gig and substituting some other form of tech that allows the same sort of things to be accomplished.', ""\n\nninjashira:\nIf he went braindead at home, then his physical body will have started to decay and there will be nothing for him to return to.\nThis doesn't seem (to me) to follow logically. Braindead (no higher cerebral activity) could exist (and does if I understand correctly) while the autonomic bodily activities continue (e.g., heartbeat, breathing).  There will come a crisis, though, if it happens outside a facility (e.g., hospital, clinic) that can provide intravenous or feeding-tube sustenance. That can be used to create a sense of urgency in the story."", '^ That could be used for his character arc too, if you decide to go the route of making him a shitty person  If he drives away all of his friends, then being braindead at home & having no one notice or help could be the kick up his ass he needs to change.', 'Hi, Thanks for your opinion and I\'d like to correct you on a few points.\nPoint (1) I believe mine to be different because this is not a typical gaming console such as putting a VR headset on, but instead using your own dreams and creating your own imagination. \nPoint (2) I will not deny that saying ""I\'m the embodiment of chaos"" is cringe, but it\'s just there to tell people that he\'s one of those typical evil protagonists.\nPoint (3) His life isn\'t necessarily ""awful,"" but his relationships with people are awful. You can think of him as a psychopath or sociopath. this may be a spoiler, but he\'s actually well off in life. You can also say he\'s ""bored"" of a normal life I guess.\nPoint (5) I was only giving the summary, but the thing that lets him control his own dreams, will obv have an emergency thing that contacts authorities that will let him get to the hospital. And you can think of the ""console"" that lets them use their dreams as a ""game"" a chip implanted through proper surgery.\nPoint (6 ) Like I said on point 3, his life isn\'t typically ""awful"" just his relationships with people. And he wants to go back because he would really like to keep living and get rid of the ""betrayer"".\nIf this cleared up any confusion then that\'s great! If you still are confused on some points, please state them, they might even help me make it seem more ""clearer"" for other people.', 'Thank you for your comment!\nFirst, I made most of my points in the reply for @ninjashira. \nSecond, in summary, it states that people can transmigrate through other people\'s dreams, making it seem like an ""online"" concept.  If there\'s a way to ""log out"" online, he should be able also to do it. But it\'s more challenging because he was ""forced"" to go to someone else\'s dream. \nThird, I also would like to answer this point without a lot of spoilers, but you could say they ""legally"" were able to stabilize there company by making buyers sign a big contract, and making it expensive in order to lessen the victims, while also being able to make up for what would\'ve been a money loss. (There\'s also another way they were able to lessen the victims, but that\'s the big spoiler that will be in the story.)\nMy second point may not be able to clear up most of the confusion, though it would be a big spoiler to say how he can get back to his own consciousness', ""It may sound like criticism, and it may be criticism, but some people may get confused by not having much information coming out of my summary or misinterpret it wrong. No hard feelings  non-sugar-coated opinions help me learn and understand where people may be confused, and that's what helps me become a better author and solve those confusions."", ""I've read many manga's and Novels about VR, or other gaming consoles. But I've never seen one where they've made use of peoples dreams in order to create a game. I'm set on this novel for a future project, but a future project is what it is cuz I'm currently already writing something, and it is to have at least 100+ chapters until it's end."", ""Lol \nI've cleared up most of the confusion in reply to @ninjashira comment. If you're confused, you'll probably also want to read it."", 'Oh, no. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. My comment was directed at you. I was trying to help give you some ideas for stronger characterisation and story development. But with the way you replied to me, I think that may have been your idea all along? ', ""Okay well it seems like you have everything well in hand and nobody else's comments here really seem to be affecting anything in any way, so while I'm not entirely sure why you asked for feedback if you were going to casually brush it all off anyway, it sounds like you should just go ahead and start writing your story. You clearly know what you're doing and have a direction that you want to follow, so now it's time to get started on it! Best of luck in your writing endeavor!"", 'Oh my bad, thanks for clearing up the confusion!']",7/19/2021 9:02,https://forums.tapas.io/t/needing-opinons/61826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30,TOPIC FOR PLOT: can you teach emotions to an AI?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Don't know how it would work for an AI, since it doesn't have a body, but when you boil it down, our emotions are chemical responses that are (mostly) geared toward ""rewarding"" us for fufilling our biological functions, so it wouldn't be too far fecthed of an idea.","[""Emotions are an integral part of our reward control system and regulation of thought and decision processes, so I'd even postulated that you won't get a functional AGI without including emotions into it. They're a fundamental system that evolved and convergently evolved across all animal kingdoms (Even crayfish and bees were proven to get anxiety), so they must be important for functioning of the neural networks."", ""I think it's probably a fundamental paradox.\nThe root of most emotions won't be a desirable trait in an AI so they won't be built or programed to fear...to crave...to desire.\nBut humans are fallible beings, full of hubris, so I imagine someone will TRY it."", 'I actually touched upon this in one of my comics (SadBot):\n\nSad Bot WT2.png800x380 250 KB\n\nThe way I see it, this question needs to be traced back to what humans understand emotions to be, inherently. Is it any more than the interaction of chemicals and synapses that cause the body to behave in a certain way? If that\'s the case, if you were to simulate that same thing in an artificial body or intelligence, what would make it significantly different from how human minds operate?\nAnd tracing the question back to ""what do emotions mean?"" also carries with it ""what does thinking mean?"" and that\'s just the fundamental question of whether or not AI could ever be considered valid as sentient life. For some, there is a certain criteria that must be met (such as the Turing Test) before you can consider an AI to be sentient. For others, AI is inherently, without question, not sentient and can only ever be a convincing imitation at best.\nFor me, personally?  I abide by the Turing Test criteria: if I (or humanity as a whole) am unable to distinguish the AI from an actual human (or any thinking creature, actually), then it\'s sentient - and thus, has valid emotions - in my view. If ever there exists an AI that is that convincing, I fear that if I, or anyone else, attempt to constantly verify, ""Is this a person or an AI I\'m speaking to?"" then there will probably be a number of biological humans that would fall outside of the arbitrary criteria applied. In which case, what\'s the purpose of the distinction anymore?\nThis question also makes me think about the droids from Star Wars - by all means, they appear to be fully sentient beings with their own emotions, and yet the entire galaxy, good guys included, still treat them as if they are no more than machines. I know that this makes me feel uncomfortable, so I imagine I would continue feeling the same way if they were made real. I could go deeper into this topic, but I feel like the Youtuber, Pop Culture Detective, covers it pretty well in this video:\nThe Tragedy of Droids in Star Wars', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', 'Yes, because our emotions are just illusion... it\'s just simply same information as any other in our brain, and all data are just states of ""memory cells"", or synapses, or whatever form we save it to, and represents in, but generally we are just big heap of atoms or/and particles, that work by rules of psychic... nothing else...', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', 'My no comment due to thread blocking.', '\n\nSMZ:\nhow do we humans learn about emotions?\nThe same way we learn about how to grow hair: we don\'t. You can\'t ""teach an emotion."" They\'re inherent and present from birth.\n\n\nSMZ:\nBut how do we make AI learn those emotions, to make it more empathetic, to make it indistinguishable from a human being?\nThe simplest way is to model the AI after the structure and logic of the human brain, so basically to produce a digital human. I believe that the first functional sapient AI will be made this way, and it\'s probably the only way to make a sapient AI. We barely understand how our mind works in detail, so the only thing for us to do is to imitate. Accidental sapience is highly unlikely to occur.', 'I suppose they\'d need a purpose to fulfil. At the end of the day it is what motivates animals on a fundamental level. Although I don\'t suppose an AI would have the same fundamental motifs as animals, as it doesn\'t so easily ""die"" as we do. In Maslow\'s hierarchy of needs, for example, anything above the physical needs is related in some way to self fulfilment, so it goes back to the AI\'s design.', 'Oh hey! I’ve had this discussion before. \nIt seems to be a “what came first, the chicken or the egg” discussion. The answer is the egg (it’s always the egg). Part of the issue is there needs to be a basic definition for what constitutes ""real"" and ""emotion"" (otherwise this will turn into a semantics tangle).\nEmotion: a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one\'s circumstances, mood, or relationships with others.\nHumans aren’t the only living things with emotions. Most, if not all, animals have emotions, they’re just communicated differently. The difference in communication and display is what makes them difficult to measure. We’re even finding out that plants make decisions and communicate with one another, it just happens on such an enormous time scale that humans have a hard time perceiving it.\nEmotions aid in decision-making for most living things. In this sense thay are entirely “real” and have a large effect on reality (reality is subjective to the one perceiving it. This means that no individuals reality is more or less real than any other). There are no “fake” emotions. There are displayed emotions and internal emotions; one does not necessarily beget the other.\nThis is why I think the initial question is too vague. A well-functioning AI would innately have it’s own “emotions”, just by logical default. I think the issue stated is more socially oriented.\nI don’t think the actual question is “Can you teach emotions to an AI?”It’s “Can you teach empathy and or sympathy to an AI?”\nSomeone who is born without the ability to innately enguage in empathy is a sociopath. This is more or less (my understanding of) how an AI would would initiate. This person does still have all of their own emotions. This means that, if they are willing, they are capable of manually learning sympathy.\nSo… yes?\nCan emotions be measured?You would have to account for the discrepancy between emotion felt and emotion displayed and then relate that to some form of standard per that emotion+circumstance.', '\n\nSMZ:\nWhy should the idea that you want to equip an AI with emotions be arrogant, if these can facilitate the dialogue of the same AI with human beings?\nIt\'s the same type of rational that Asmiov applied to his Three Laws of Robotics. A higher life form, like an AI, is going to develop a form of self preservation. Our own self preservation logic would dictate that this has to be superseded by ""laws"" that protect humans above the AI. \nBut any attempt to inject emotions into an AI\'s reasoning is creating a double edged sword.\nFirstly, it creates an impetus for the AI to find ""loopholes"" to any course of action that leads to it\'s own impending destruction ahead of other sentient beings.\nSecondly, if the AI does follow a course of action leading to it\'s own impending destruction... The hubris of man is only creating emotional suffering needlessly. You\'ve created a tool keenly aware off it\'s own limited role and eventual end.', 'If said AI has a physical body with functioning nipples on it, then yes, you can teach an AI emotions.', '""If emotions are illusions, how can we recreate those illusions in the artificial mind of an AI?""\nThis is good question, but no human can answer it. We know it\'s complex process mainly based on energy discharges, chemical reactions, and connections between specific ""cells"" of mind (we can replicate it with memory cells, receptors, and artificial synapsies), but the problem is, no one know how specificaly. We already have a lot of stuff like processors for AI, like (TPU), and also libraries like for example tensorflow, in which we can create some really good alghoritms (that can learn to recognize animals for example).

RELIC HUNTER: RIVEN -STORIES from the Wasteland | Tapas
Cycles after the end events from ''TALES from the Wasteland'', two worlds apart, two Relic Hunters find themselves in new hardships. One working to prove herself alone in the wasteland, and the other, is fighting to return to a familiar land.





","['Wouldn\'t say I\'m a pro but I\'ll say off the bat, your art is fine it isn\'t amateur enough for someone to not want to read the story.But yeah I can understand if you started in 2014 and only have 54 subscribers you may seesomething being wrong.\nWhat I would look into is your synopsis for the first link.It\'s very barebones and doesn\'t really sell what your story is about.\n""In the Wasteland of GUARDIA, Relic Hunters roam the planet searching for \'RELICS\' of the past. This is the many tales of Riven: the \'QUICKSHOT\'""\nIt mentions certain elements of the story but from a reader who doesn\'t know about anything from your comic it doesn\'t really say much nor sell them to actually take a peak to see if they would like it in the first place.A solid synopsis can really help with that first step of just getting a readers foot in the door. \nIn terms of composition I do think the comic could benefit by adapting to a scroll based Webtoon format. Especially if you plan on uploading on Webtoon, readers are usually more concrete in wanting that format for their comics.\nOf course this is all just surface level critiques without actually reading your work in depth and seeing if the writing is a issue but still, some critique is better than none.', ""You may want to try to submit your work to Viz Original28 instead (if you haven't already), if it's not doing well here."", 'Hey there!  Haven\'t read your comic in full yet, so there ain\'t much I can say about the story itself, but so far I can tell you that the art style looks great!  That said, some things I noticed: \n\nYou\'re posting your comic under the Fantasy category. As of now, that\'s an extremely overcrowded category, making it hard for anyone to be seen. The great majority of ""popular"" works in the Fantasy category are premium series which get constantly boosted on the homepage of the site, while to find a popular free series... right now, you have to scroll all the way down to row four. Unless you have a bazillion of subscribers already, your only chance to be seen in the Fantasy category so far is either appearing in the Fresh section (aka where all comics that have just updated go) or to make it to the Trending category (which, tbh... I have no idea how it works. I read that you should get lots of comments + likes in one day, but even when I had people liking 20+ episodes of mine in a row and commenting I still never made it to the Trending category, so... meh). I strongly suggest moving your comic to a different, smaller category. Less competition against big, popular, constantly boosted series = more chances for your work to be seen. I see you\'ve got ""post-apocalyptic"" in your tags, so... maybe ""Science Fiction"" or ""Action""?  \nThe first comic you posted was updated somewhat consistently between years 2014-2016, then slowed down in 2017... and then completely stopped updating for two years, until you announced that you were coming back last year in 2020. First post is from August (announcing the return of the comic), second post is from October (showing a preview of the upcoming return), then... nothing else. That\'s almost a year with no updates. Unless you\'ve been consistently promoting your comic elsewhere on social media or using low cost ads, it\'s VERY hard for a comic that doesn\'t update to consistently grow its audience. Even worse, people who used to follow you in 2014-2016 may have left... or, if they\'re still on here, they may have forgotten about your comic and left once they saw you updating again because they were like ""who IS this person? I don\'t even remember following them D: "". It sucks, I know, but sadly it happens \n\n\nWhat I suggest: * (If you intend to keep updating the first of the two series you linked) Work on building a buffer. Make sure you have enough pages to keep the comic going even when you don\'t have the time to draw new pages. Also, pick a consistent update schedule and stick with it. Doesn\'t have to be a weekly schedule, you may even choose to update only once a month, but whatever you choose, try to keep it up. Readers like to know when to come back  * Consider posting on multiple platforms. ComicFury and Webtoon are also good alternatives. On Webtoon, it\'s a good idea to post your comic in a vertical format, since it\'s what\'s gets promoted the most on there, but the audience is pretty big, so there\'s that! Other alternatives could also be GlobalComix or Flowfo. \nBest of luck! ', ""I can't speak for retention, since I've only been making my comic for half a year. But in terms of gaining subs, I have a little more insight.\nYour artwork looks really cool, especially the newer comic, but there are a few choices you've made which make gaining an audience harder.\n\nBlack and white comics just don't tend to do as well in the webcomic world. As a stylistic choice I think it's valid, and it's obvious you're going for a manga-like aesthetic - but it won't attract as many readers, and that's just an unfortunate fact. I'm not suggesting you change it - but it's a limiting factor which needs to be acknowledged. There are some advantages to a manga-like work in the print medium, such as easily selling it at conventions and such, so there is a balance here. Just makes the web side more tricky.\nIt's hard to read on a phone. This is another major limiting factor for attracting an audience on platforms such as Tapas and Webtoon. If you reformatted the panels to stack one on top of the other, that would solve this issue. It doesn't take much time, and makes your work much more accessible. The original page-format version can be sold as a printed version.\nThe synopsis don't really tell potential readers anything about the story. I know there are relics in a wasteland, and people hunt for them. Buy why? Who is hunting them? What do these relic hunters want relics for? Are they valuable? Dangerous? Of historical importance? And what of the main character, what reason do they have to search for these things? What are they like? Do they have a goal? Potential readers need to be curious about your character and story before even reading Page 1, and the synopsis is how you make them curious.\nLastly, and this is a simple change, the titles are WAY too similar. It's unclear that they're different stories at a glance. You should keep the 'RELIC HUNTER' part, if that's the name of the series, but completely change what comes after it.\n"", ""So you mean 'Traditional submission' then? Well, it's been a while since I tried again. Let's see. Thanks for your insight."", ""Yea, seems if posting online the SCROLL format is KING nowadays. I'll have to think about making a comic just in that format because.... honestly I don't really like the scroll format but I see that it makes quick reading and skimming easier for people. Thanks for your insight."", ""While I can't tell you what exactly happened in that period of time, You are right that there was a dip in time. Just based off your understanding I'll see more about a buffer. I'll also check the alternative platforms to see if it would suit me better. Thanks for the insight."", ""Hmm.. while there is a lot to unpack here and there are quite a few things I'm actual on the other side of the fence with you about. You are right and everyone agrees with you: Scroll type comics and color comics sell here. Manga and Traditional style is not suited for this website.\nI'll rework the synopsis a bit and see if that can spark curiosity more.  Thanks for your insight."", ""\n\nKaydreamer:\nIf you reformatted the panels to stack one on top of the other, that would solve this issue. It doesn't take much time, and makes your work much more accessible.\nJust wanted to add a footnote here, as someone who converts pages for webtoon myself, and in case OP really goes in this direction. Depending on how many pages you convert to scrolling for one episode, and how creative you get in your original version's paneling, it can take a buttload of time to get those things done. In some cases, it might require a bit of redrawing to get certain things to fit right\nThere's also the amount of real life time you have to consider, especially if you're trying to do that while actively working on your recent comic."", 'It\'s a shame this comic isn\'t doing as well as it could be on tap, since I really like the premise of both stories. I agree with almost everything else everyone said so far, so I\'ll just add one from my own experience: Don\'t neglect to do the necessary legwork to get your work seen. That could mean posts on social media, posting to mirror sites, and even dropping some promos here in the forums.\nThe one thing that hurts most small creators like us is the self-defeating mindset of ""build it and they will come"". It\'s a very rare and very lucky comic that gains traction with the author doing no work to rep it at all. To do what you need to for your pride and joy, you will have to force down the feeling of ""If I talk too much about my work, I\'m spamming"" I\'m still really bad at that myself with social media.\nHope all the advice helps! I wanna see this comic do well, especially as a fellow B/W, traditional format comic creator', ""I am completely confused. Maybe not promoting it enough? \nBy the way your art looks and story telling you should have more subs. \nATM I am struggling as well. I too have made my comic black and white, and I'm trying to hit 100 subs. \nI hope we can reach our goal."", ""From someone who loves your book, my only note is the chapter sizes (each chapter is pretty big). I just find that I don't have that kind of time to scroll through your comic as often as I'd like to (I barely have time for any comic unless they're single page updates). \nHowever, keep in mind, this feedback is SUPER self-serving and I'll make it a point to get through some more chapters this week because you really do great work. The people above seem to have good advice for you, so I hope you can implement some of that and get on the right track and find more of your people. They are out there."", ""To be honest, I wouldn't want to redo these because the pages are made for TRADITIONAL LAYOUTS. Separating them and putting them into a SCROLL format would do more harm to FLOW, MOVEMENT and STORY than I think would help it....\nMy story isn't meant for SCROLL. It's a book format and I have to accept that people won't like it if that is what they prefer.\nThanks but, like mentioned above RP, I'm gonna try to think of a story that suits this format and let this live as it needs to be.\nThanks for your insight."", ""Yea, it's hard even with a bunch of Hashtags to gain footwork to here. But I'll keep trying to put it up on SNS to get more traction.\nThanks for your insight. I'll check out your comic too!"", ""Thanks for your insight!\nI'll stop over and check on your comic also. Yea, maybe promotion is best but I always thought people who like to read stories online share it more often? Dunno, but I'll try it out."", ""Good to see you here. I've been checking your work as much as I can too.\nThe Scroll... this is killing me. But again it seems more apparent that online comics need to be shorter and able to be scrolled through for flow. I'll look into storytelling like this but, I'm a bit more surprized to hear so many people like this. I wonder how other physical media appeals to people...?\nAnyhoo, I get you. I'll see about cutting it down into two parts maybe? I figured more for the buck but if people really dislike long chapters then... dunno...\nThanks for the insight."", ""Yeah, and believe you me, I love sitting down with a physical book (and I layout my comic as a book before I chop it up for web too), but my eyes get so strained at the end of the day, I just can't stare at my phone for very long."", ""I understand that. I guess It's something I'm going to add to the consideration list. But it's good to remember this. I get heavily into reading and looking at chapters so I usually go in like 4-5 at a time. We are all different kind of people. I just need to remember that."", ""About the scroll format: tbh, this is kind of a recent(-ish...?) trend that started with Webtoon and Tapas, which are mostly mobile app based. Problem is, since Webtoon and Tapas ARE the two biggest platforms to host webcomics and grow an audience, you'll see a lot of pressure to turn your comic into a vertical scroll format, even if you never planned to do it that way. I myself started to post in a traditional format (and I still do it on my website and on ComicFury), but yep, definitely felt the pressure to switch to a vertical format for Tapas/Webtoon. It is not mandatory, of course: on Tapas especially, you can get away with a traditional print format... but Webtoon seems to be more strict about it. \nThat said, I've also seen comics in traditional format doing pretty well on Webtoon, like Closely Knit1 (which was even recommended by the staff at some point), Istrevelia and Crankrats. \nFor traditional print format, I think ComicFury is truly the only platform left with a decently sized audience that won't make a fuss about the kind of format you choose. FlowFo and GlobalComix seem to be fine with either format as well, though neither seems to have much of an audience (it's also true that FlowFo is VERY new, though). \nAs for Tapas and longer episodes... problem with the site is that it doesn't really have a way to bookmark your progress mid-chapter. So if you stop reading a multi-page chapter halway through, the next time you come back to it, you'll have to scroll aaaaaaaall the way down to find the panel you were reading again. Webtoon works a little better in that sense and will load the page starting from the point you were reading last time.""]",7/11/2021 7:04,https://forums.tapas.io/t/not-feeling-confident-anymore/61501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You'll get more subs and views with time. Don't give up!"", ""Thank you very much for the critique. I'll definitely be adding more backstories and expanding on them in the story. I wanted to do it when the time was right, but I'll definitely be planning more to get the backstories in there sooner."", ""I was going to suggest that you pick a more appropriate font... but you already did! Your comic looks way more polished already just from changing the lettering. I think you could adjust your speech bubbles still. They feel a bit off to me, but I can't quite put my finger on it - might be that there's too much space between lines of text vs. how much space is between the text and bubble.\nI'm not a great person to give feedback since I don't read almost any slice of life and I think it tends to have a different aesthetic. But for readability, I think the biggest thing that throws me off is that your backgrounds compete with your characters a bit - same saturation, brightness, line weights makes it a bit hard to let the eyes focus. I think in some cases it gives a sort of flat feel to things/calls attention to perspective or environment elements that are distracting from your story and characters.\nLooks like you have nice colors and sweetly cute characters . Traditional pages are going to be slower than something mobile friendly but I assume you're already aware of that! Eight episodes is of course a lot of work but isn't very far in the world of getting subs I think so just keep it up."", ""Thank you very much. I'll try fixing up the word bubbles a bit and work on changing the background colors. I see what you're saying now and now I realize why I felt my backgrounds were a bit off. Thanks."", ""You actually have a really nice use of color and clean lines. Nothing looks too off with formatting either. The only thing I see that would probably stop me from reading is just that the proportions are a little weird, especially with the side view and 3/4th angle. The shape of the face reminds me a bit of troll face with the cheek and lower jaw sticking out. But these are just something that can be fixed over time with practice.\nI do agree the speech bubbles looks a bit empty.  That's because you're using circular bubbles instead of a more square bubble. When you try to add a lot of text into a circle bubble it'll make a lot of extra space on the top and bottom. It's mostly down to personal preference. I like to use circle bubbles too but I generally don't have a lot of text."", ""Thank you very much for the critique. I'll definitely see what I can do to improve the side views of the characters. And will also be working on the word bubbles.

The imagery is evocative and quite vivid. \nThat being said, it just does not feel like a prologue. It feels like it would be right at home even if it was placed in the middle of a story. The reason for my opinion is that you intend to introduce several people at once in the first episode. While it is not impossible to pull off an ensemble introduction. It is inevitable that you will divide your attention focus among the several characters. Hence, the first episode does not generate the impact needed to hold the reader's attention and make them want the next episode. There is a good reason why many stories that feature an ensemble cast start off with a bang. It is because the unfolding events occurring around them distract the readers from noticing the otherwise undeveloped main characters. It makes the reader wonder how they got to this point. Unfortunately, a campfire scene does not evoke that same sense of wonder. In a serene scene like this, it is up to the personality of the characters and how they interact with each other that keeps the readers invested. Reading the character's inner thoughts really helps in that sense. \nOverall Opinions:+ Evocative descriptions+ Great imagery\n-- Focus is too divided-- No attention to the character's personality, just the appearance.-- Paragraphs look a bit cumbersome \nI hope my advice can help you in your creative endeavours.

I'm guessing that even though your main characters are from the race of dragons. Judging from the art of your book, the characters themselves are still humanoid in form? \nRegardless, the setting and world-building you provided is evocative and engaging. Though I don't really know how to imagine the Jade Construct that keeps getting brought up.

I like how ominous it felt when the potential antagonists were introduced.\nYour story may get a bit hard to follow especially when confronted with the fantasy terminology used throughout your story. It gets pretty rough when my assumptions and the story begins to clash with one another.\nAn example of when this happens in your story is when you mentioned the male lead's scales being exposed to the winds. When I read this detail at first, I had no idea that they were dragon-like beings. So, I was temporarily in a state of confusion. \nTo absolve this, I'd advise mentioning the important details first before making any references to those referring back to those details.\nFor example, you should mention that the characters are dragon-like beings before talking about their scales.\nLastly, I might be a bit biased regarding this, but I felt like the episode might be a bit too long. Especially since Tapas scale of story should be a bit more bite-sized than average. I like to think of the first episode as being like an appetizer for your meal. \nOverall Opinions:+ Great World-building+ Characters are given personality and a unique appearance+ Easy to digest paragraphs\n-- Using fantastical terminology without much explanation to what it is may be a bit hit/miss-- Appearance of important details can be organized a bit better-- Just a little too long\nOther thoughts:If possible, I would love to talk to you some more about how your story is built.

Thank you for participating."", 'sorin_gran-I took a gander at your first ep!\nImmediate impression: \nThere’s too much exposition at the start. A novel’s first few sentences are crucial to grab the reader’s attention. Right now, I’m not invested. \nThe formatting is a little weird, to be honest, and throws me off. You’re formatting it like you would the exposition for a comic instead of a novel. (Even if this were a comic, it’s front-end exposition heavy).\nGetting past first impressions…The dialogue is clunky and doesn’t really flow like natural speech. Though the dialogue has potential to be incredibly engaging, a bit of TLC will get it there.\nThere isn’t really a sense of scene. You don’t give any details for the scene itself. Sure, we have some setting details (like the population, how the king is chosen, etc), but that’s not the scene. I can tell from the impression of the dialogue that the POV MC (Thomas Talon) is in some kind of stadium, maybe? But it could just as easily be a flat open field with a bunch of on-lookers.\nBecause you tell us that the population is low, I don’t expect this to be a big open professional soccer field style stadium; instead, maybe a High School soccer field with bleachers? But again, without scene description, we don’t really know.\nYour first ep definitely has potential to become good; it definitely speaks more to a comic format instead of prose/novel format.\nGood luck on your tapas journey!', ""@sorin_gran I read your first episode as well and I think there's some good stuff in there. I agree with lordmouri that there's a bit too much exposition, but I also see why you included it. Exposition is hard, and I like the twist - first you think the narrator is an onlooker narrating what's going on, then - surprise - he actually won the tournament and he's a kid. What I would suggest though is that you make the exposition a bit more interesting stylistically. Your protagonist seems to be quite snarky in his thoughts, so maybe add some commentary to the exposition. You can also shorten it a bit, just think about what's actually necessary for the reader to not get confused. You don't need to list the three nations and their populations, for instance. In general, I'd suggest that you focus on your protagonist's inner voice more. Right now you're mostly just narrating what's happening, but not really sharing his emotions, thoughts, etc. You're writing in first person, and one of the main advantages to that is that you can give your character a distinct voice and really delve into his emotions. Everyone has a unique way of thinking and speaking, so try to establish that for your character. Does he swear a lot? Does he use a lot of ellipses when he's scared or unsure of something or lost in thought? Does he get lost in thought a lot? Does he use more creative language, puns, made-up expressions? Creative insults perhaps? Does use long, complicated sentences to seem intellectually superior? Is he cocky? Timid? Caring? Uncaring? Curious? Disinterested? Rebellious? Obedient?And then different stylistic means can also convey different emotions and moods. Right now I can't really ... feel your character's emotions yet, and that makes your text a bit dry to read. Imagine your character was actually talking - people have different ways of talking when they experience different emotions. Long sentences, seemingly neverending, divided by commas, but taking ages to actually end, those kinds of sentences, maybe with some repetition, they'll give off hectic, stressed, out of breath vibes. And then there's this. Short sentences. Lots of full stops. Not even bothering to add a verb. Staccato. Those can seem bored, or stressed as well. Maybe just play with different stylistic means, sentence structures, choice of words, etc, and see how it sounds to you. Again, there's some good stuff in there already, and your novel definitely has potential. I can't really say much about the plot having only read the first episode, but it seems interesting so far. I think it could just be even more entertaining to read - and thus draw more readers in - if you gave your character a more distinct voice. He seems interesting, too, so I'm sure people will be interested in his thoughts and his story."", ""I took a good look at your comic. I have to say, you made a magnificent teaser! I took a glance at your first episode as well. So I'm just going to give you my thoughts.\nI really like your choice of words! It's direct and gives off a strong impact. The art style melds very well with the story you are creating. Though, there are things that may affect your story negatively. \nIt reads like a children's book. This is not necessarily a bad thing. But the readers may be wanting something more in line with what the featured comics of this website provides. \nI see that you do seem to be quite hard on yourself in regards to the pacing. So far, I do not see many hints of sloppiness or pacing issues. It helps that you can use your story's art to alleviate some of your storytelling burdens. \nI believe that your story has the potential to develop into a great story. Just make sure to maintain a strong sense of direction as you develop your story. Losing that sense of direction is the first thing that will end up creating a bunch of smaller problems in the future.\nYou do not need to listen to what the readers want from your story. It is your story first and foremost. As long as you can tell your story in an easily conveyable manner. You will naturally gather an audience just like that. \nOverall Opinions + The artstyle is very compatible to your story+ Easy to digest+ Intriguing sense of foreboding+ Nostalgic style of storytelling\n-- The girl telling the story should get some more development\nI hope my advice may lend you a hand in your story's development. I am looking forward to the growth of your story. Subscribed!"", '\nThank you so, so much!I honestly consider myself more of myself as a digital artist than a writer, so thanks!Glad you enjoy it.', ""Your chapters are really short. So I just looked through all of your episodes heheh. \nYou really put alot of heart into the art of your comic. You are a talented artist. Wish I can get good at drawing.\nThat being said, maybe its due to how short the episodes are, but they kinda end in a strange note. Like nothing significant really happened and then it just ends. Since you had more than one episode published, I could read through them with a good sense of continuity. But when I reached the last episode, it just feels really abrupt when it ends.\nBut I don't fault you at all, writing and illustrating your story is incredibly laborious work. I cannot do what you do, that is for sure. So far, not too much has really happened which might make your pacing feel a bit too slow. But the premise is interesting, the memory recall scene was my favourite part so far since it gives the readers more of the backstory about your main character. But right now, there really isn't anything to motivate me to read the next episode when you publish it. I'm not saying to use cliffhangers every single time, but maybe you can figure something out that will dampen the abruptness of your endings. \nOverall Opinions:+ Incredible artstyle+ Easy to digest\n-- Endings are abrupt-- Nothing plot-wise is really happening yet\nI don't really like nitpicking and being overly analytical in my reviews. I just want to convey my reading experience and comment on the highs and lows along the way.\nThank you for participating and good luck on your creative endeavours."", ""Thank you so much, that was really helpful. You're right about the length of the episodes ... they do get longer, but they're actually pages rearranged into vertical format and right now this is all I can do. T_T But I'll try to think of a way to make them more interesting in the future, or to adjust my updating schedule. ^^And thank you so much for your compliment on my art, it really means a lot.  (I was actually pretty insecure about it XD)"", 'Damn, those waffles dealt him some emotional trauma. Not gonna lie, it\'s kinda cute. Maybe you should have named the title ""The Waffle Blues"", haha just kidding. \nMitta has an appealing sense of charm to her. Like she\'s both cold and heartwarming at the same time.\nI like how your story is developing, interesting characters, good sense of pace, and it makes me want to read more. \nI\'m not a huge fan of being overanalytical so let me just say that my reading experience was uninterruptedly pleasant! I had to go over the story a few more times to get a better understanding of the setting but that\'s more so my own fault. \nOne can say to emphasize the important detail, but as someone who is not too big about emphasis, I don\'t really care.\nOverall Opinions:+ Great character building+ Entertaining waffle trauma+ Setting is well described+ Easy to digest\n-- A few typos but it is forgivable\nThank you for also commenting on my work! I hope to see you again in the future! Maybe we can have a discussion about our stories in the future.

34,Cat’s Reviews,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Heyy! I've got some free time and want to do something helpful. That's why I decided to do reviews for everyone who's interested! These reviews will be posted on a website66, so they are also a way to promote your work!The form to sign up for a review is here69.
Some short info on the reviews, which you'll also find in the form:[Due to high demand, i'm not offering short reviews right now, pm me if you want to get a reminder when I'm offering short reviews again]
Novels
I already did a bunch of reviews for novels and I'm writing my own novels while reading a lot as well, so I think I can give helpful advice. I will be honest, but not harsh, don't worry.
Short reviews
These short reviews are free. However, they aren't that detailed. I'll have a look at the part you want me to review and give my initial thoughts on the story and if it makes me want to continue reading. If there's anything that stands out to me or that I think other people who read the reviews would be interested in, I'll write about it in the review. But I won't go into detail or write down my thoughts while reading. I'll also put several short reviews on one page on the website, so you'll have to share the spotlight which isn't the best promotion you could get. All I ask in exchange is that you share the review on your social media.
Long reviews
These reviews cost £5 per1000 words. I'll review the story in more detail and actually read everything that you want me to read. I'll talk about the characters, the plot, the writing, pacing, and so on. This means it's a review with a critique. Additionally, I'll contact you before I do the review to check if there's something you want me to focus on. I'll also write down my thoughts while reading your story. Thoughts that give away too much of the story will be sent to you in a private message, along with any spelling or grammar mistakes that I find. So the review won't contain any major spoilers. Your story's review will also get its own page on the website to get the best promotion possible.
Comics
Although I make art myself and I read comics every now and then, I don't think I'm an expert at reviewing comics. However, I can still give you my opinions as a reader. If you're looking for a really qualified reviewer, please read the information on expert reviews.

If your comic doesn't really have a story or consists of one panel per page, you might want to have a look at the expert reviews instead.
Expert reviews
These reviews will be done by an artist5 who can actually give a high-quality review of your art as well. If your comic focuses more on the art or doesn't really have a story, these reviews might be the best for you! These reviews are also for comic creators who are mostly looking for feedback on their art or feedback from another artist.  A 200-word expert review of your comic costs £12. The price for longer reviews can be negotiated. You get a free long review from me on top of the expert review.

37,Representation: Yay or Nay (I Need MORE Feedback.),Reviews | Feedback,[],"So I already posted about this on the Tapas Discord server a couple months back... or maybe it was last month, the days kinda melt together anymore.  I did make a decision and was going to drop it, but since then I've talked to a couple other people who've put me back on the fence.  Honestly I want a good sum of opinions to help with brainstorming what to do.
For more context my comic is a mental health and abuse vent comic where the MCs go the worst experience in their lives before working to get better, it will get really heavy and I'm sure many will label it as tragedy porn or torture porn.  The story is very cathartic for me, hopefully for others who deal with crap the same/in similar way that I do.  It has been a very important bit of content for me to work on.
Anyways, back when I was working on chapter 3 I made the decision to make one of my characters intersex because some of my readers thought they were, and after doing some research it just felt like a good decision. (They used to be an AMAB non-binary character.)  Like finding a puzzle piece that fit.  Well, just last year I realized I probably should seek out some sensitivity readers because the intersex community is so small, and heavily shat on.  I found two who gave me a hard bit of reality, one being more chill with it and the other thinking I wanted to make the character suffer because of them being intersex, and found the story rather offensive.  This made me think that maybe the decision was a bad idea, regardless of sex I'll be touching on gender, sex and self-hate, and thought it wouldn't be my place to tell this kind of story with that kind of character.
Since then I've gone around asking for more viewpoints on this because it's a tough decision to make.  One half says it's not my place, and would be insensitive for me to continue with the decision.  Others have said that all my characters are terrible people who make awful decisions, it shouldn't matter that one happens to be intersex.  That it might be cathartic for some intersex folks who deal with stuff in that way, or that I would have to do the same for my whole cast since I don't have personal experience with any of the communities they're part of as an AFAB transmasculine asexual person who was raised white. (Two of my characters are cis gay males, one is a Hispanic bisexual male, another is a black transwoman, another is a Hispanic lesbian, etc.)  ""Why would you give special treatment to one community and not the others?""
So, what do you all think? Would it be best to change this character back to being AMAB? Or should I leave them as intersex?
For those of you from the Discord who see this, and have already talked about it with me, you totally don't have to respond again! The discussion was very nice, and I appreciate you all for taking the time to talk to me about it.","['The issue with sensitivity readers is that, as you just described, some people in a particular group may be perfectly fine with something, while others in that same group may find it offensive.\nWho\'s right? Both. Neither. It\'s just people\'s opinion, and everyone has a different tolerance level for different things. Minority voices aren\'t unified in opinion. They\'re just humans, in all the diversity of opinion that entails.\nIt\'s a lot like the catch-22 situation of including minority characters at all. Some people will say ""You have to include minorities, representation is important, and it\'s racist/sexist/phobic not to."" While others will say ""These aren\'t your stories to tell, and it\'s offensive for you to have minorities in your cast when you aren\'t one."" How do you appease both? By not writing at all. Which I find unacceptable.\nMy take on it is to just tell your story the way you want to tell it. It\'s your story. If you\'re worried it may upset people, make sure to be up-front about that the story contains, trigger warning anything which needs it, and let the chips fall where they may from there.\nYou can explain why you\'ve made the choices you\'ve made if you wish to, that may help people who would otherwise be put off at least understand that you\'re not being malicious, even if they don\'t like the story.\nEDIT:That isn\'t to say a writer should have licence to be totally daft about bad representation. I\'m not advocating for writers making only their bad guys minorities, for instance, or leaning hard into negative stereotypes. I do find such things unacceptable. But avoiding that is pretty easy.', 'Phew. That\'s a lot to unpack, but I\'ve got a few things I wanna say in response to this.\nI won\'t say much about myself or my private life, but I have a different opinion when it comes to ""representation."" Personally, I don\'t care if someone is apart of my in-group or not, as long as they represent it the way it is. Sure, it won\'t  be ""perfect,"" but that\'s kind of the point in my eyes. Just because I\'m a part of an in-group doesn\'t mean that my experiences are exactly the same as everyone else\'s. I\'m okay with seeing a slightly adjusted take since a stereotype would be much worse to me. I ain\'t a member of a hive mind; I\'m me.\nIn the case of my own story, I have several characters that are apart of in-groups I\'m not in! The trick for me is to tell the story respectfully and to not fall for the bait that some people might give. At the end of the day, it\'s impossible to make everyone happy. It\'s harsh, but true. There will always be someone who won\'t like what you\'re writing, but that\'s okay. Heck, chances are that if I wrote about something negative happening within my own in-group, I\'d get attacked by my own people.\nThe story you\'re writing is your story. You\'re not a ghostwriter, and there\'s no big scary Mafia man holding a gun at your head saying, ""YOU\'D BETTA WRITE THIS AFAB TRANSMASCULINE ASEXUAL WHO WAS RAISED WHITE CORRECTLY, OR YOU\'LL BE SEEING WHITE AT THE PEARLY GATES, CAPICHE!?""\nWhen it comes to creativity and expression, doing what your heart wants is the best direction to go towards. That\'s what art is, after all!', ""Just write what you wanna write. If people find it too difficult, then perhaps it's not for them. I don't read romance because I hate the way most relationships are portrayed, but it just means I'm gonna skip and go to something else, not that people should stop writing romance to please me.\nSame thing happens here. Your character is just 1 iteration of a lifestyle, not the spokesperson of the whole community they're in, so obviously not all people in that community are going to relate to them and some will call bullshit. If you're white, you might not relate to ALL white characters out there. Same if you're black, homosexual, etc. Does it mean these white/black/etc characters are offensive and badly written? No, just that there are many flavours of white/black/etc out there.\nDon't treat your character as a token for all members of community xyz, just treat it as an organic character with a unique lifestyle and see how it goes. People should be able to write the sort of character they want without having the thought-police come at their door to scream it's offensive."", ""the people who preach 'stay in your lane' and 'write what you know' are also the first to complain that there isn't enough diversity in media. so long as you make a point to do your homework and be respectful, then you're doing okay. That's the important part. It's a little trickier when you talk about writing diverse characters when it comes to things like traditional publishing and people feel like you're taking up space that should belong to the people of the community in question, but this is the internet where anyone can post whatever they want and we never run out of space.\nit's understandable that some people feel hurt when they see a character who is like them being made to suffer or being cast as the villain, but you write so many diverse characters that anyone who is paying attention would notice that it's you're goal to be diverse and tell the stories of many kinds of people, not to be cruel."", 'Fff thank you all, I really appreciate you taking the time to respond to this silly topic!\nI admit I\'ve been beside myself about this partially due to how things have been on the internet lately, a lot of fiction policing, a lot of accusations based on what art someone creates, sometimes leading to dogpiling.  I\'m nervous about offending the wrong people down the line and getting trashed since I\'ve seen it happen more times than it should in the past couple years.  Also I do want my character to be seen as a ""good character"", not a positive one, just a fully realized one and I worry about messing up.  I\'ve noticed intersex folks are very into you knowing all the medical details of intersexuality before applying it to your character, and I\'ve gotten a bit overwhelmed since there are so many little details.Also whenever doing a story about difficult topics it is frowned upon to use character from a community you\'re not a part of since it comes off as fetishizing or phobic of that group, and it is no longer your story.\n@Kaydreamer I\'ll be honest with the one who was more alright with it I didn\'t go to far into the more difficult details.  It was a video call, and my brain registered it as a interview or test so I brain dumped everything as soon as the call started.  Plus it is much harder for me to verbalize difficult topics than type them out, but yeah, that person seemed more focused on the medical stuff and making sure I wasn\'t making my character a stereotype. (They were actually kinda happy that this character started out as a different sex, and that I only changed them after doing some reading up on it.)  At the end I gave them a link to my comic, and they didn\'t have any issue with it, this person liked the art. LolWhat made me second guess myself more after getting both was a video the first one made on intersex rep, and it felt like some of it was directed at me, or at least people like me.  It\'s a pretty informative video nonetheless1.\nThe second one got a written doc with all intersex related scenes, it wasn\'t super detailed since I didn\'t have a proper manuscript and just described the situations, but it was detailed enough to be offensive.  Although I was a bit confused about some of their critique since one of my scenes had really implied sexual harassments with the character\'s partner, and I put content warnings for sexual assault, but they thought it was a consensual kink scene... and told me that the partner was fetishizing them and that the reader was really uncomfortable.  Which is what I intended, so I wasn\'t sure what to do about that criticism.  It felt as though they generally saw me as someone wanting to bring this intersex character torment because I thought it would be edgy or unique, which was an expected response but it still made me really apprehensive to continue with my decision about the character\'s sex.\nYou\'re right though it\'s kind of a lose-lose situation with rep with some people.  I know I\'ve already been called a few choice things due to my characters.  Also fiction would be extremely boring if everyone only stuck to their experiences, I can\'t imagine not going out and expanding your horizon for a story.  Sorry for the ramble, I\'ve been running myself in circles over this, and I can talk for ages about it.\n@Oto_Kouda Hey, you don\'t know that! The fiction Mafia could very well be with me right now, threatening that very thing.  They could have a gun to my head right now. -dramatic music-\nGosh, I\'m kinda weird about rep.  I don\'t care who does it, just give me a shitty human character over a positive rep cardboard cutout.  Respectful to me is having characters that are presented as people with flaws, bad decisions and that ugly stuff, it feels like I\'m being acknowledged as a person... or I\'ll take a really camp, fun villain character that doesn\'t need any kind of depth, just fabulous clothes and bombastic mannerisms.Fff speaking of writing negative experiences and in-group attacks, I\'ve been called transphobic a few times for some of my characters being casually transphobic.  I have a good reason for some of those scenes, and why the characters didn\'t get their comeuppance, but to a reader who don\'t know that it can come off as me being alright with their actions.\n@Birbmagadon You have a good point! I admit I\'ve gotten in the habit of thinking my characters represent their entire community, it feels like anymore you need to keep yourself and your characters in-line so you don\'t offend anyone.  Not saying that as a negative thing since I understand the need for good rep, but some people get really anal about how positive fiction when featuring minority characters, and I\'ve kinda fallen into the ""How my characters act will determine how people see \'x\' community, and will determine how \'x\' community sees me"" mindset.  The thought gets somewhat terrifying when you\'re an anxious person who overthinks and like conflict.\n@burgundy  Lol I\'m trying to do a story set in a southern California city like LA or San Francisco with a higher diversity demographic, also LGBT+ people hang out more with people in their community than with cis-het people, at least in my experience.  More research is definitely something I need to do, I\'ve done a lot of studying on the social aspect of it, but there\'s a lot of...nuance? to intersexuality that I haven\'t been able to wrap my head around yet.  I didn\'t think about how indie webcomics are vs. published as far as taking up space, I\'ve seen a lot of people preach keeping certain stories for own voice creators because you would be taking attention away from them if you didn\'t, but there is practically endless free space on the internet.  I wouldn\'t be taking any more away from an own voice creator than any other person posting their story on the internet (Heck, they may even get slightly more attention because people like authenticity with stories featuring minority characters.), even if they decided to work with the super niche category my comic is in there are so few people making those types of stories I doubt they would have anymore trouble getting attention than the rest of us.\n\nAgain, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me your opinions on this! Sorry if my grammar and spelling or anything else is off, I\'m tired and just about to go to bed.', ""Most intersex people consider it a disability so idk why people are getting angry that an intersex person isn't happy with their condition? Like i've been on so many intersex sites, youtube pages and such and many just consider it that. I dunno if this helps but I found a reddit with some interesting takes about what its like to live with it https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyIntersex/4"", 'I\'m going to be blunt here, considering how you refer to your characters only by their gender or sexual identities. You mentioned having a reader who found it offensive, and I can\'t help wondering if you\'ve fallen down that path of writing to appease audiences, creating representation that most would love to see. But you fall short in this ""forced rep"" that your characters no longer even feel like people, but instead are just labels, not even characters. You changed a character (who you couldn\'t even name here) to be intersex just because some readers told you too. I\'m sorry, but I\'d never change a part of my character like that because of what some readers said. Like I said before, it feels like you\'re trying to force having representation and forgot to make them resemble actual people. I could be completely wrong here, and feel free to correct me at any time as I\'m not trying to be rude. I just feel like you really need to take a look at your characters, beyond the sexual and gender identities. Why should this one character be intersex now instead of AMAD non-binary like you originally had? Does it fit the character better? Because that\'s the only reason you should change it. Not because of what some readers said. \nI also have to ask, is there a reason this character needs to suffer? Does it play a role to the plot and character\'s development? I\'m already iffy with your phrase of it being ""torture porn"" to describe your story. Personally, I think you need to flesh your characters out more. For starters, identify them by name. Always.. Don\'t just be calling them "" my intersex character"" or ""my black transwoman"" When writing stories with touchy subjects, you always need to make sure to stick to realism and being sure your character isn\'t just a ""representation"" to appease audiences, which might have the opposite result.\nFor your question, you should do what you want. It\'s your story, you can write whatever your heart desires. I just highly advise you to remember making your characters more than just intersex of AMAB. Otherwise, that can come across as offensive. Good luck with your writing! I\'m sure you\'ll realize what\'s best for your characters. Only you can decide in the end.', ""@indagold  Awesome! Thank you for the reddit link, I never go on that site so I had no idea there was an intersex subreddit.Maybe it's like when cis-het people say 'queer' vs. LGBT+ people? Or something of the like?\n@AnimeKitty Alright, to make a few things clear.  I don't make my story for anyone, I didn't even think I would have readers when I started because it's a really niche genre.  As stated in the OP my comic is a vent comic, which means I'm using it for venting, (Specifically mental health issues, trauma, gender issues, general bad experiences I've internalized throughout my life.) so it is not for anyone.  Just me, doesn't mean I can't care about how my characters come off to other people though.  If I wanted to write at story for other people I would be doing a YA unproblematic romance or something.The venting thing is also why my characters are going through a lot of shit for most of the comic, it's cathartic for me to make them go though all that.\nI bring up gender stuff because sex and gender are the main topics of my concern, only bringing up other character's genders and such against myself because I was giving an example of how my characters don't align with myself... meaning none of my characters are from my groups to bring context to the quote I mentioned about asking why I would give special treatment to an intersex character while all my other characters haven't been given the same treatment.  I don't know how to make this make sense, all I'm saying is my characters aren't just their genders and such, I'm only bring at up in this specific instance because it relates to to topic.  Within the story my characters hardly even bring up their genders or sexual orientations because the focus is on them being flawed, shitty people... I also admit that I don't even know how any of them came into their sexualities and genders, it just happened, I guess you can say they chose what fit themselves.Also I didn't change my character's sex because my readers told me to, no one told me to do anything in that regard.  I had a few scenes that some readers thought came off as intersex related, so they asked me if the character was intersex.  At first I said 'no', but decided to do some research on the subject just to learn more about it, and I wanted to see how they made that connection.  After learning about intersexuality a little bit it just clicked, making that character intersex just fell into place like a puzzle piece, not because anyone told me to do it, the decision just felt right on it's own.\nRegarding your critique about fleshing out my characters and realism, assuming you've read my comic to get to that conclusion, do you mind going a little more into detail about it? When it comes to stuff like this I need more specific instruction or I'll end up overthinking, and messing up.  To tell you why I don't refer to any of my characters by name in this thread their names don't matter in this context, no one needs to know that kind of detail to give an answer, I don't like adding more info than necessary since I already practically type out novels when posting anything.\nSorry if this came off as snarky or rude! I totally don't mean that, I'm just really blunt or anal when trying to explain myself depending on how serious I take things.  I do take this seriously so I just want to clear all that up.  Regardless, thank you for your response, I really appreciate you taking the time to give me your point of view."", ""Thanks for clearing things up! I haven't read your story, as you didn't share a link to it in this thread. I went solely based on your post and how you portrayed your characters there. I can't say I understand the need to not mention your characters names, but everyone has their own views. I just feel like it helps to connect and understand them better when we have a name. It's hard to empathize with a character who's just been labeled by their sexual identity. But again, totally my personal perspective there.\nI see, it's more of a personal project for you but you're wanting to share it with others and make sure not to make your characters offensive. I really appreciate the in-depth response, as it helps me a lot to understand what the issue is. I'm sure you'll always find someone who finds it offensive but everyone has their own views of what they think is offensive. Some will go as far as saying you can't write a certain character unless you can personally relate to them. I kind of went off base on your post here and wouldn't mind checking out the comic itself. Just share the link here. I see what you mean on why you made your character intersex now too. From your post, it made it seem like you changed it because other readers wanted you to.

I\'ve been around for a few years how, whoever would be interested has probably checked it out already.I just see them as tools for a story, or to explore themes and emotions, I thought people would only want to answer the question at hand so I didn\'t want to personalize the characters more than needed.  I forget that people don\'t normally have the same thought process, and they actually want to relate to and connect with characters.\nYes! Although it\'s a weird situation, I don\'t like offending people, but at the same time I realize my characters can be offensive because I wanted to have people with flaws, and sometimes shitty viewpoints.  So I guess I don\'t want to be offensive in a way where I\'m unintentionally dehumanizing or fetishizing a certain group with how I\'m writing the character, if that makes sense.  But you\'re right, there will always be someone who gets offended, even with my warnings and attempts at research I\'ve still offended people.\nI\'m glad my initial response didn\'t come off as rude, I was trying to word it in a way that wasn\'t and it just sounded that way no matter how I did it. LolIf you really want to check the comic out I\'ll put the link in a spoiler.  It\'s rated M for a 17+ audience, and be sure to look over the content warnings in the description.

It\'s funny because I\'ve seen the same wording pretty much everywhere, everyone harms everyone with their existence and ideologies pretty much.  ""Pansexual people harm bisexual people"", ""bisexual people harm gays and lesbians"", ""gays and lesbians harm heterosexuals"", ""asexual people harm allosexual people"", ""allosexual people harm asexual people"", ""non-binary people and intersex people harm trans people"", ""trans people harm everyone.  Everyone is harmed by trans people.""After seeing the post in that Reddit thread I think I\'ve seen every variation of ""The existence of X community does harm to Y."" It\'s all so ridiculous, almost comical.', ""Every intersex board or reddit i've been on is LGBT infighting more than any other lgbt identity i've come across.

But I have been reading your comic for a while now (absolutely love it by the way!!!) and if an aspect person showed up in it and were terrible, I would not care at all. In fact I would probably be excited that I could enjoy a bad person with something in common with me without groaning at the stereotype. if they were described to me out of context I might be lead to believe I should be angry, but not with context.\nAgain I have no intersex knowledge authority but I felt like saying this somewhere Guess. Sorry if it's out of line or not my place."", ""A thing I found is a big beef is many people fake being intersex.

Lol\n@indagold Oh that's nasty, that sounds worse than those people who pretend to be black during the black artist # promos on social media, I can see why they would be pissed off about it.  Lol the fake sex variation reminds me of those mary sue OCs people made back in the early 2000's that had some kind of rare disorder that made them better than everyone else in some way, with no negative symptoms or anything.\n@kitschensyngk To clear things up for your last sentence I'll just quote a response I gave to someone else who brought up something similar:\nI bring up gender stuff because sex and gender are the main topics of my concern, only bringing up other character's genders and such against myself because I was giving an example of how my characters don't align with myself... meaning none of my characters are from my groups to bring context to the quote I mentioned about asking why I would give special treatment to an intersex character while all my other characters haven't been given the same treatment.

I really appreciate it :DD', 'This is possibly going to sound a little harsh, so understand I have the best intentions to help here... I don\'t think you should use any of these colour combinations.\nThese colours are all extremely drab, lacking variety in both value (dark and light) and saturation.

Maybe punching up the contrast for a sort of ""dirty 90s Grunge"" look would help keep that collage look intact while making it pop more?\nThe one with the coloured faces in the middle is probably the strongest in terms of popping visually, but it\'s also harder to read what the image is than the black and white one. Overall I\'m on the fence about the collage theme. It\'s novel for sure, but when the intended use for the graphic is to arrest the eyes of somebody scrolling through a site or app, you may want to prioritise an image that the person doesn\'t have to stare at for a few seconds to work out what it is, and where the ""active"" part of the image isn\'t confined to a little blob in the middle of the page.

For the final version the cover, I will be bringing this crisp version of the lettering back, but for now, I\'m more concerned about the colors. \n..@darthmongooseI can definitely see where you\'re coming from! You\'re right that there isn\'t a lot of saturation or value, which is why I\'m trying to get feedback from people to tweek the colors until they look right.\nPart of the reason why I want to keep the cover a bit monotone is because my webcomic is in black and white, and I wanted to show a little of that in my cover as well (also because I heard from a couple of readers that it was a little frustrating how they would click on my current colorful cover and expect the webcomic to be in color, only to see that it\'s black and white).\nI\'ll try increasing the character\'s size and see if that helps prioritize the ""active part."" I\'lll probably also make the paper-rip texture a little bigger too. For the background, I\'ll try keeping it simple as blocks of color instead of lined details and see if that also help with the ""active part"" of the cover.\nThank you so much for the detailed critique!!', 'This is lovely! I don\'t have a big eye for professional art criticism, so all I can say is that it looks really nice. The colors are working for me. In a sea of covers that tend to have a lot of brighter, brilliant colors, the ones that don\'t end up standing out more. I\'m also super biased toward wood tones. What the title says, and the imagery around the cover (the knife, the glaring eyes, ""My Enemy"", ""War""), contrasts with the natural, calming colors in an interesting way. The boxed-in letters add in a feeling of ""This is going to be a fun journey; expect some comedy"" (but can also add more of a creepy feeling, because they look like children\'s play blocks almost. It\'s like how horror movies use lullabies, and suddenly those sound chilling), and the the rest is so artsy and creative.\nAs for the images in your original post, I don\'t see a whole lot of difference between any of the pictures so I\'m useless there.  The one at the bottom stands out a bit more. I think it\'d be easier to tell if I saw the actual letters with the background comparisons (and, because of color relativity, the look of the background color can change depending on the color of the letter you put at the front, so seeing them with and without the letters may give different results).']",7/6/2021 23:12,https://forums.tapas.io/t/feedback-for-my-webcomic-cover/61314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","[""Hey there! So I read through the first several episodes of your comic. I gotta say, the artwork is gorgeous! Your colors especially are fantastic. Art-wise I don't really have many critiques, aside from possibly taking the time to trace your 3D backgrounds and recolor them yourself so they match the rest of the art better and look less obviously like 3D models, but I don't think that's keeping you from getting or keeping readers.\nFor me, I had two big things with the writing that would keep me from continuing reading your comic. The biggest one is the grammar. I'm assuming English isn't your first language? The phrasing and tense isn't quite right, and it's a little difficult to understand what the characters are trying to say. I very very highly suggest getting a native English speaker to proofread your scripts so it's more accessible to a primarily English-reading audience. If people can't understand your dialogue, they can't read your comic.\nThe other thing for me is personal taste, honestly. I'm not a big fan of the cheesecake vibe you've got going on, and the fact that the MC turned an animal into a woman and within minutes he had sex with it. I'm sure it appeals to a certain audience, but it's very much not my cup of tea, and is mildly sexist in a way that makes me a little uncomfortable. If I feel that way, I imagine there are others who feel the same way as well.\nBut if you can find that niche audience who is into that sort of story (I'm sure they exist) and if you can fix your grammar, then you certainly don't have anything to worry about art-wise.\nBest of luck going forward!"", ""yes English isn't my first language and I'm still trying to save money to hire a translator, and ooomygod.. after you explain I understand now that I think I have made a very big mistake at first episodes DX but thank you very much!!! :))) I'll make this one to learn more then..""]",7/5/2021 23:08,https://forums.tapas.io/t/would-you-like-to-give-feedback-for-my-comics/61270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scrapyard Castaways | Tapas
On the forsaken island of the scrapyard, which is the dumping place of criminals, defective cyborgs, experimental chimeras, and junk, an odd group emerges. 

Will they kill each other? Or become friends?

An insane knight-zealot, a grouchy...





","['Okay first, Hey Kate, was going to say you don\'t have to sub or like unless you are actually are interested in my work but realized you were already subbed, (Small world lol) but alright, let\'s get to the review\nIn terms of Art, can it be improved? Yeah like anyones art; but from what I can see its solid enough to hold an audience for a comic which is good. Your style is unique and im able to understand what\'s going on in a scene without getting confused or lost which for me is a important part of reading comics. \nNow I\'ll talk about mostly writing.\nTo start solid opening for chapter 0;  I think though in terms of writing in chapter 1 there are noticeable hiccups. One that I\'ll point out is a few instances of how the characters talk to one another, it felt like it was the characters not talking to each other but the reader. \n\nScreen Shot 2021-06-30 at 10.29.04 AM.png712x443 244 KB\n\nFor example Eriin says to Wrench ""This Island has hardly any resources, Trash like us don\'t get sugar....."" While okay at face value I think this is a major world building point that Wrench should know assuming she has been living on this world for quite some time, so Eriin going in depth explaining this to her seems kind of out of nowhere? And though yeah, I get that it was probably a way to throw information about the world to the reader I think it could be done more naturally and improved upon a tad..\nMaybe to make it sound a little more natural on Eriins end while also trying to explain to the reader the ongoings of the world, he could say something sarcastically like ""Yeah, cause this island is literally BOUND with sugar and resources...."" (Doesn\'t have to be exactly this but just shooting from the hip) \nAlso just watch out for certain typo and wording mistakes that could go unnoticed. ""Trash like us, doesn\'t get sugar"" should be ""Trash like us don\'t get sugar""\nThere is even another instance where Eriin goes to Wrench\'s caravan to get a repair and she tells him ""I\'m the mechanic, let me look""\nI know this was probably to tell the audience that Wrench is a mechanic and all, but your art is good enough that it is able to visually show that she is some sort of mechanic, on top of the fact that Eriin says that he is going to her for a repair; so her telling him this is kind of redundant from a dialogue point of view, especially due to the fact she already knows Eriin, and knows that he knows she\'s a mechanic.\nPart 2 is much better in incorporating world elements into the dialogue in a natural way. Had no issue with the way Sun was introduced,  and the way Wrench commented on ""Going to the scrap side to fix them up"" was also very natural so again no issue there. Also like the big brother vibes from him.\nPart 3 had one wordy speech bubble by Wrench where she commented on not wanting to save the wounded soldier; which involves how she barley has supplies for all three of them and that the reason she repairs them is because she knows they will pay, throw in their a mention of the soldiers blue and gold armor and how she doesn\'t want to deal with a religious zealot.\n\nScreen Shot 2021-06-30 at 10.30.13 AM.png728x599 448 KB\n\nThis was solid, a little wordy yeah but okay; I do think breaking up the speech bubbles so the bubble doesn\'t look too crowded with words could help though, you want readers to see all your dialogue and sometimes speech bubbles that are filled up with words can be a little bit of a eye sore on a page when scrolling; so just think about how much words you\'re fitting into one speech bubble\nBut I do like wrench\'s reaction of the sword of the knight with a quick ""You know the rules of the island, finders keepers! He\'s mine!"" afterwards. Natural stuff like that is how world building talk can be natural between characters as well as communicating information to the reader.\nChapter 4 was also an improvement from a scroll layout point of view. It flowed better than 2 and 3 which I get because there was less information to get across but still, liked how it was played out more than the previous chapters. and the way the ocean came into frame going into the flashback? Great stuff\nSo yeah perfect no, but no comic is, still a solid start. Congrats on 50 subs by the way, that\'s a great mile stone achievement\nKeep creating!', '\n\nkatewindloft:\n\nPlease give me some critique.\n    tapas.io Fall Of Humanity | Tapas\nThe Dragon King will call,Dragons will riseFrom clay and earth they will crawl. Lost and scattered, the Doryu will aris\nFrom the shadows of their landsHumanity will fall,Into the hands,Of the dead gods, The heirs of Flood and Blood....\n\nSure, because I want to practice my plot review and beta reading skills. Let the questions be my guide...\nReview questions:\n1.\tWhat do you think of the story as a whole?Promising. \n2.\tHow did the characters develop throughout the story?Even though it\'s just the preface and prologue that\'s only present, the past of those characters were introduced well and the readers can already get the action but tragic vibe of story. I like the concept of shifting the readers\' focus of being in the shoes of the dragons instead of the humans. I mean, most of us creators will write stuff where MCs are humans and that we relate to them because they\'re humans [obviously] but this story gives us a promising plot wherein it\'s a dragon-driven tale. Not like the How to Train Your Dragon series, we\'ll feel more on what an actual dragon feels. However, I\'m still not sure whether the MCs are actual dragons instead of humans. Kind of misleading because title pertains to humanity while the blurb pertains to a dragon. Whose POV should I be looking at: the dragons or the humans?\n3.\tAt what point did you feel “ah now the story has really begun”? Well, it\'s not there yet since it\'s a prologue. But I get that the story starts the moment the ""hibernation"" begins.\n4.\tWere there any parts you find yourself skimming?I found myself skimming episode 2. Why? I\'m already given the impression that the MC is a dragon but why am I getting the pronouns he-he-he-he? Remember: when you introduce that dragon, start off by describing the marks of his suffering based on his appearance. We wanna know what kind of dragon he is. Of course, you can maintain those humanly pronouns but anyone can\'t help but feel the pain as a human rather than as a dragon. Mention his snout, his claws, his scales, and other parts that show traces of pain. Make us feel that we readers are dragons too.\n5.\tWhat was your favorite part of the story and why?Sure I do like the part where you romanticized then dramatized the part where Regina is also suffering but I preferred last paragraph of the update where you made me look forward to the story now that the great dragon is sleeping. Episode 4 made me feel more for the humans\' side rather than dragons. If you plan on convincing readers that the dragons\' side is good, then help me shift my focus or else I\'ll join the dark side. \n6.\tWhat was the most suspenseful moment in the book?The part where the sleeping ritual started [not gonna say the actual term of the spell].\n7.\tWho was your favorite character and why?So far none. Let\'s just follow the story and see if I can route for someone along the way.\n8.\tWere there any moments you wished lasted longer?Yes, in episode 2. I wanna know how the humans stole dragon magic. Just a give a brief statement on it and not just definition of it. This is a david-vs-goliath sub story for me. \n9.\tWhat is the theme or message you took away from the story?We\'ll wish more for the ruin of the big people rather than the small conniving people that masterfully dominated the big guys. Well, it\'s a fact in both reality and in fantasy.', 'I recategorized the thread to Reviews, so no one else would just see this as a promo dumping thread.', 'Really helpful cuz I was just looking forward to be reading reviews in this thread.

Dan | Tapas
This is the story of a boy being rejected by society and hated. However, his life takes a big turn once he realizes his hidden ability. What is Dan's ability? How did he attain them? Is Dan a hero or a villain? Who is right or who is wrong? In this...





","[""So, I have read the first few updates, and here is what I think:~ Aside from the anatomy issues (which I'm sure you are working on improving anyway, so I'm not gonna say much there)  I think the panels are moving a bit too fast. For example when the one character knocks the heads off of the extras, it goes by too quickly, say in 2-3 panels. Try slowing down moments, which will make them more impactful. You can do this in a few ways. You can increase the panel size itself, as a larger panel will demand more attention, and slow down the scrolling, to the next one. Or you can utilized more panels to highlight the action more. \nin this first example you can see the character reacting to something and turning around to a creepy figure. This could have been done with say 2 or 3 panels but instead the motion is slowed down, and taking a bit of time to focus on the expression of the character.\n\nsdf.jpg1518x2150 615 KB\n\nOr as here you can see in the second image, the larger image demands more attention, slowing down the reader to really focus on the epic action you want to create. \n\nchapter 4 pg 13 150ppi.jpg940x1331 325 KB\n\nI often like to think of comic panels as a half-way step to animation. The more images can smooth out the action. And I find that really good comics feel like an animation, that flow so smoothly I forget that they are static images.\nI hope that helps you some."", "" Thank you so much for taking the time to look into my story and give me artistic advice. I'm curious about your thoughts on my webcomic story-wise."", 'Story wise:I know you are showing flashbacks to show character development, but I personally would like more current day development. Your character seems hell bent of revenge, because of bullying. Which I feel is rather one dimensional. To expand upon this, I would love to see Dan\'s every day struggles with life. Such as home, or work, or other social events. Rather that seething rage, what sets him off. What really bothers him specifically and why, did something happen to his mother to set him off. Often times people with anger issues have specific triggers, for example my dad would go off when something would break (typically the lawnmower or something to that nature), or even just working/chore issue in general, repeating himself too many times, etc... So, what sets Dan off, other that just a general hate. Make a specific list, such as ""insults to one\'s family name\', appearance, etc..."" I suggest this so that it doesn\'t appear as vague, giving for character more depth.\n I also know someone who is a general misanthrope, and has a extreme dislike for people. So, that individual generally extent little to no trust to others, of will always assume the words in people. Tending to avoid them or sass back like a monster. XD One of the reasons why they became that way was, yes, partially due to bullying, but they were also taught that all people are out to get you. And, the general menagerie of how other people interacted with each other. Sometime this thoughts and behaviors develop through observation of others (who may of may not even affect your life directly) in addition to your own issues. \nAs someone who had a similar bullying experience (except for the physical harm) You tend to float between anger, depression, and nothingness. I would love to see these explored more in your character\'s development. And as weird as it might seem, the nothingness is a very dynamic feeling. The apathy, the indifference, and self isolation feels like a black void. \nI understand this is an action comic, but if you want to bring more emphasis on that action itself, use the down time to build up. Such as showing the character struggle with self control, or inner thoughts and dialogues. Body language. etc...\nAction is cool and all, but I am more interested in the psychology of Dan. Think of the action as sprinkles on top. Because at the end of the day, a good fight is fun to watch, but it doesn\'t always move the plot forward. Like unnecessary romances. Character development will engage the reader, and then you can add the delicious sprinkles of action after.\nSide note: I am not sure how old he is and I find that confusing because I though it said that he was maybe 10 at one point, and there there was a 15 year flash back, so that means he is 20 ish. XD\n I hope this helps.', 'If you are interested in looking at literary examples of writing, might I suggest reading ""death of a salesmen"" and disecting the character phycology. (as insufferable as that book is) I think it does a decent job showing the character\'s rational. I think it does do a good job of showing someone with anger issues.', 'Thanks for your insightful analysis and tips. Dan is 20 at present and in the 15-year-old flash back he was five years old. The story starts off with dan at the university but never mentions his age specifically but rather hints at his age during the 15-year flashback.', 'Thought I should bump this thread.', ""\n\ncjspiethillustr:\nAction is cool and all, but I am more interested in the psychology of Dan. Think of the action as sprinkles on top. Because at the end of the day, a good fight is fun to watch, but it doesn't always move the plot forward. Like unnecessary romances. Character development will engage the reader, and then you can add the delicious sprinkles of action after.\nThis. Don’t be afraid of “down time” between characters.While in the world of action/fantasy/adventure web comics I understand it’s thought that it is needed to always have something Flash going on like fights but if you look at some of the greatest fights in any genre, lets use Shonen as a example, 9/10 people love these fights is due to the fact we understand and like the characters we follow.\nLike above said, you can have the best fights, the most interesting world and all, but usually what brings readers back to your comic or novel after awhile is if your characters are engaging enough to even come back to.\nThis in turn creates much more emotionally engaging fight sequences because at that point readers care about the people involved in said fights. So don’t stray away too much of not diving deep into the psyche of Dan, because it’s the little stuff like that which makes all the difference come eventual fight sequences and for the story as a whole \nPlus, conversation scenes and character introspection sequences can sometimes even be more engaging to some people than actual fights, of course if the creator is able to deliver them naturally""]",3/30/2021 21:26,https://forums.tapas.io/t/what-are-your-honest-thoughts-on-my-webcomic/56896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","['I dont see where the story is going in the prologue. Maybe give more foreshadowing or something to better hook the reader? Sorry Im not the best critic =(', "" Thank you! Already a little helpful, I'll take that into consideration. One question: would you read further than the prologue? Be honest, I want to improve!"", 'I think the font gets a little thin and harder to read, but nothing too problematic. The lighting and perspective are very good, and besides that it’s a little intriguing.\n\n\nYS_og:\nI dont see where the story is going in the prologue. Maybe give more foreshadowing or something to better hook the reader?\nI agree, I’m not sure what’s going to happen, but it’s not altogether bad, since it sort of draws the reader in? It could foreshadow a bit more though.\nIn terms of reading past the prologue, I might binge-read it a bit, but then put it down and not come back, since 1) I don’t have a Webtoon account so I wouldn’t be able to subscribe, and 2) it just doesn’t necessarily seem like my type of story.\nHowever, I’ve only read the prologue, so I can’t say for sure.\nI wish you good luck in finding readers!', 'Okay, so I read your first three chapters as you requested, and I can offer you a few suggestions for areas of improvement and point out some things that would turn me off as a reader that may be acting as a hurdle to you getting subscribers.\n1 - Right off the bat, in your prologue episode, I spotted at least two typos. It\'s a minor thing, but it screams at the reader that you, the author, can\'t be bothered to spellcheck/proofread your own work. So if you can\'t be bothered, why should the reader? Obviously you care, but that is kind of the vibe that it gives off when there are easily-fixable spelling errors. If you aren\'t confident in your spelling abilities, or English isn\'t your first language, I recommend either getting someone to proofread it for you, or using something like Grammarly or the spellcheck in your word processing program, then copying and pasting the text from your word document into your art program, rather than retyping it in your art program, to help avoid typos.\n2 - The prologue is confusing to me as a reader. At first I thought the overlaying narration was the internal monologue of a character, but with all the shifting scenes and locations and characters in the very long introduction sequence, I wasn\'t sure who the main character was or why I should have any kind of emotional investment in this overly-dramatic prose-heavy narration. \nThen I found out, OH! It\'s not an internal monologue, it\'s a writer who is writing a book, and even he thinks it\'s a little cringe! But in that case, I think his cringey writing went on a little too long. It goes on long enough that the reader is going to think that the entire comic is going to have this melodramatic prose feel to it, which it doesn\'t. Once you get into chapter one, the comic is actually kind of goofy and a little slapstick-y, so the prologue feels very out of place, and that alone is probably losing you readers. Anyone who likes the melodramatic prose-heavy intro will not enjoy the sitcom/romcom/goofy story, and anyone who likes the sitcom/romcom/goofy story is going to read this very long intro and think, ""Well this isn\'t for me!"" And they\'re going to leave. Your prologue should have the same vibe as the rest of your comic, because it\'s the reader\'s first impression of the story, and should set the stage for what they should expect out of the rest of the series.\nAlso, when it was revealed that the writer was actually just typing up this narration that was almost the entire first chapter, my initial thought was that he was writing fiction, and that none of what he was typing for his book actually happened to him. It wasn\'t until later that I realized that his mopey novel writing was about something that actually did happen to him. It\'s a level of disconnect that is just confusing enough to turn off new readers.\n3 - Your backgrounds are... rough. I love that you are taking the time to draw plenty of backgrounds and adding a decent amount of detail and believability to your scenes, but it\'s very clear that there is a lack of understanding of fundamental perspective rules. For example, in this background scene...\n\nimage.png528x696 391 KB\n\n...all those lines you are using to indicate windows should be converging at the same vanishing point off in the distance. And if you\'re using one-point perspective, which it looks like you\'re going for in this shot, your vertical lines should all be parallel, not at an angle.\n\nimage.png519x693 318 KB\n\nI really recommend studying how perspective works in order to strengthen your backgrounds. Because the fast that you are drawing so many backgrounds at all is great, and that puts you a mile ahead of other beginner comic artists who avoid drawing backgrounds at all costs! But you need to know how to draw things accurately in perspective to clearly convey your ideas.\n4 - Speaking of backgrounds, you have some points where things get weirdly pixelated. Spots like this...\n\nimage.png789x671 361 KB\n\n...around the edges of the yield sign and the bridge in the background, you have these white pixel gaps. And places where you use this cobblestone texture...\n\nimage.png792x374 368 KB\n\n...that is maaaaad pixelation. It\'s very off-putting to the eyes. If you\'re using pre-created assets like patterns or shapes, make sure they\'re at a high enough resolution that they won\'t get this angular distortion, because it\'s difficult to look at.\nAnd on a similar note, I think you might want to consider toning down your use of pre-generated patterns and textures, it can be a little clash-y sometimes. For example, in this sequence...\n\nimage.png392x608 338 KB\n\n...you\'ve got like five different patterns and textures going on. It\'s a lot for the eyes to process, and distracts from the characters, which should be the focus of the art. Keeping backgrounds simple and clean can actually be a difficult thing to train yourself to do, and learning to be okay with some empty fields of color is tricky, but it\'s in the service of maintaining clarity and making sure your characters stand out. Your backgrounds should support the character art, not distract from it.\n5 - From another clarity standpoint... You use a lot of fonts. A lot of fonts. In your second episode, I count 8 or 9 fonts that are not SFX fonts. It\'s a bit much, and is kind of distracting when a reader is just trying to soak in the story. Good dialogue lettering should almost be unnoticeable, it shouldn\'t really catch your attention. I do like that you use the typewriter font to indicate the novel text of the guy writing his book, against the more traditional hand-lettering font for the rest of the dialogue, but it should be consistently that way. Only use the typewriter font for the novel, and only use the hand-lettering font for the dialogue and internal narration, so the reader instantly knows what they\'re reading and what the context is.\n6 - Finally, and this may just be a personal choice, but when your comic went to stick figures, my brain completely checked out. Stylizing/simplifying or ""chibi-ing"" your characters for the sake of humor is great and fun, but reducing it to stick figures is a step too remotely disconnected from the rest of your art. While it may not be your intention to come across this way, when I saw the stick figures, my brain immediately said, ""Oh, this artist was too lazy to draw this scene properly."" I\'m sure that is in no way what you were going for, and I\'m not suggesting that you were being lazy, but that\'s what my brain (and I\'m sure other people\'s brains) thinks when I see that.\nSo, I know this seems like a lot, but hopefully this can help you focus your efforts and intentions towards more deliberate and clear choices going forward. Definitely keep going and keep working, the best way to get better at drawing comics is to keep drawing comics!', 'Thank you so much!️', ""Thank you very much for your honest and constructive opinion! First, I must admit that English is not my first language, I will look for the mistakes and change them. I didn't realize that the prologue can be confusing for the reader. In the next few days, I have to change that. Yes, the prologue starts melodramatically, then the next episode becomes more comedic. I would like to change that as well. About the backgrounds:  The pixelated one bothered me too, but thought it wouldn't be noticeable. Will change that too.Thanks for your honest opinion, I'll keep reading through it and improving as I go. I think my biggest mistake is trying to finish an episode in too short a time and making too many careless mistakes. Thank you so much, I was really upset here because I didn't know what was wrong! came to think that the easiest way would be to just delete the prologue and start with the first episode after correcting the mistakes?"", ""Im no expert and these are just my very personal opinions that may not apply to others.\n\nFirst ep, not much going on in my opinion. It didn't really hook me into reading it further.\n2nd ep, the text is hard to read on the phone. The font is too thin and sometimes a bit too small to read comfortably.\nSeems like there are many panels describing movements/actions that don't matter. It made me scroll and still nothing important happens... which is bad, because I know you put lots of efforts in those panels.\n\nI honestly dont care about the details of the drawing/coloring/pixeling, they are not bothering me at all as an average reader. Your art is nice. But I am a particularly impatient reader."", ""Thank you! I think that the most reader are impatient too! (me inclusive). It is difficult as a creator to see the mistakes. I'm thinking about to just delete the prologue and start with the episode 1, after I fix the fonts. Thank you very much for your opinion!"", ""Once I got over the art style, it was actually really interesting. I don't know how long you have been drawing or writing but everything seems unnatural with the way they talk, how the panels are done, and how the characters interact with each other. The anatomy is lost underneath clothing, and some of the physical and verbal interactions with the characters seem too formal, even when they are supposed to be friends. \nThe plot itself is hard to follow, and sometimes its hard to know what happened in the panels.The MC likes Adams books, why? When you have a MC passionate about something we have to know why, because we can't connect to the main character this way. Like him being nervous to meet the author, we don't know why he's nervous because we don't know much about the MC's interest or obsession with this author making him look like he is overreacting. \nOne last thing, we get to know more about Adam than we get to know about the main character. Like some of his past and we get to know his feelings. It seems like the MC is only there to be relatable and be a love interest to Adam, but that's unfair to Jonathan's character as a whole. It feels like your scared to make Adam the main character, or that Jonathan is an incomplete flat character. Most of the comic is in Adams p.o.v. and the only thing that seems meaningful only happens in Adams perspective, it also feels like the plot only progresses when Adam is in the panel or telling the story. Even if this was a love story, Jonathan should be able to have a story or at least carry the story further when Adam isn't around."", ""Thanks for your feedback! As you probably noticed, I'm not very experienced with comics yet, I started since January, before that I haven't even finished drawing an illustration, let alone a whole comic. That there will be mistakes is clear to me. I hope through the constructive criticism to improve with time. Then to the linguistic: Unfortunately English is not my first language, I use a translator. I read a lot of English books and watch movies without subtitles, but writing a natural conversation is very difficult for me. I also noticed that they are rather formal, but don't know how to change that.  As soon as I type casual conversation into the translator, some gibberish comes out that makes even less sense.  Hopefully this will get better with time. About the POV: I noticed that too, I'm thinking of starting a reboot again, that would be my 5th time, right now I don't have the energy. Nevertheless, I am aware that I have to restart at one point.

I guess I need to draw a banner for the series. Also, I am gonna work more on the cover pic in my spare time to improve it.', ""I thought they were looking for ways to make the episode better, instead of looking for ways to make it garner more views.

I think the only major flaw I see is a lot of redundancy in your descriptions, especially of the little girl. It might help to speed things up to the main sequence at the end by streamlining the descriptions a bit more, OR you can stick to more fine details but expand the vocabulary or literary devices used as to make the time spent more reading it more meaningful to the reader.

50,Critique my comic idea?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey there! I’ve been formulating an idea for a comic, though I’m going through some of my typical anxiety and denial of whether I should do it. 
Another thing, it’s hard to explain, but it’s not an action-packed comic—more like a series of mini-comics that happen subsequently. So I don’t know if people would like to read it?
But without further ado:
Title: For All Eternity
Genres: LGBTQ+, Fantasy, GL
Description: Luna and Soléis have known each other since they were mere stars. But now, all grown up and daughters of the sun and moon, they feel different around each other...
Characters: Luna (daughter of the moon, wolf’s cousin; reckless, brave, and sweet; omnisexual), Soléis (daughter—though technically she’s the second cousin three times removed—of the sun, hare’s cousin; protective, awkward, and clever; lesbian)
Setting: The Heavens, where skies are orange, the greenery is, well, blue, and where the stars, deities, and daughters may live peacefully.
Thoughts? Would you check this out? You can also share your own comic/novel ideas for critique if you’d like.","['Sounds like a cute idea with a lot of chances for beautiful backgrounds. I guess my only personal issue is that Luna is apparently a star, a ""mere"" star at that, even though they are the daughter of the moon. I would be willing to suspend my disbelief of Luna wasn\'t directly stated to be the daughter of the moon. Because the moon isn\'t a star but a natural satellite, it just doesn\'t make sense to me for their offspring to be a star, but that\'s a nitpick on my end. Other than that for me, there don\'t seem to be a real problems with this as comic concept.

For me with creating comics, I\'ll always wonder ""what if?"" I feel the need to bring my ideas to paper whether they are good or bad. As with each comic is a learning experience, don\'t fear failure. Failure helps us learn and grow.\nAnd for my ideas, well I have many...one is about a guy who can fly since birth, its his norm but he is the only one. However he deals with the pressure/fame by saving a few people. Discrimination and envy against him by his fellow school mates as he flys above them literally. But the dude just want\'s peace.

","[""My initial thought would be push the line-weight variety some? You have a really good start, but you could go for even more especially with clothing areas to create contrast against skin and muscle forms. \nI do find your shapes and forms are pretty interesting and expressive. I'd say since you have clear line elements happening I'd take advantage of them by avoiding too much color shading. Especially darker ones that might detract. The right balance is an art thing you'll probably figure out by experimenting and trying more complex scenery.\nKeep it up! Awesome work"", 'i understand what yo are saying  thank you  after i make lunch Im going to fill out a page of skeleton quick sketches, then i will go back in and play with this. \nas a thanks do you have an OC you can post here (or link me) and ill try and draw them in there?', ""I'm one of those lazy people that never took time to make a descript OC \nWith that said making your own personal vision come true is really all I want to see!"", 'I’m just here to say I really like it! \nReally expressive characters and I like your lines and shapes.', ""I do like!The body shapes and proportions are very well done. Also agree with the variety of the line-weight comment by @LCT_m_a_d\nIn a more personal taste, I don't know if adding the philtrum (the things that unites lips and nose) helps to your drawings, because you tend to make the mouth too low to balance it with the philtrum and leaves no space for the chin. Some ways to fix that is to reduce or don't draw the philtrum, move the mouth, and add the chin. Of course, this is only a personal taste of mine, you can ignore me xD\nI took the liberty to modify one of your faces file to show what I mean. The first 2 are with less philtrum, and the last two I enterily took them out.

The use of more exaggerated shapes really helps make the characters more expressive and easier to distinguish from one another without being constrained by a more ""realistic"" style. I would say keep playing with shapes and proportions for each character and push them as far as you can to make each silhouette recognizable from the others, especially if you\'ll be working in Grayscale or Black & White, you want readers to recognize the characters easily. you can always pull it back if it gets a little too crazy.\nKeep a model sheet handy, so you know whose shapes are whose, or make little notes to yourself to keep certain aspects consistent, especially when going off-model for an extreme expression or a change in an outfit or something. For example, in Moss2, this looks like the same character across all the drawings, but in the one with the rain soaking his hair, without that recognizable spiky hair or colors for context, a reader might mistake him as a different character at first glance because the shape of his chin is different in the same panel that the shape of his hair has changed. It wouldn\'t matter that much with color, but again, it\'s something to keep in mind for B&W or Grayscale\nAnyway, I\'m looking forward to seeing how you progress with this style. I really like how expressive your drawings can be when you push that cartoony square-head style of yours, so using something similar in conjunction with more realistic proportions seems like the way to go!', '@Aleksei @CloudyMagpieCory and Sonny are in there.

Love Me, Deity | Tapas
Upon starting college, Akina realizes she is a reincarnated amnesiac goddess and that there are others like her. As they regain their powers and memories, they uncover the truth of their trauma, rocky relationships, and why they died in the first...





I know I’m not the best artist around and I’m pretty new to writing so there’s some hiccups I may be blind to. There's a total of 100 pages split between 7 chapters. I'm mostly looking for feedback on my writing such as how the characters are perceived, how the story flows, and dialog. But if there's something you want to say about the art you're free to do so. You don't have to sugarcoat anything. I've been thinking of redoing this series plus I have future projects I want to do and I want to make sure I'm not making the same mistakes.
If you're willing, leave a comment letting me know, then post a pic of your character along with your critique. I may close this if I get a boat load of responses.","['I’ll will critique your comic if your sub and like mine. https://m.tapas.io/series/Scrapyard-Castaways/info1', 'Yours is very long I’ll read and critique the first 10-15 chapters.', 'So I hearted every chapter I read.\nYour art is very good. The wording is nice and Vic so it’s easy to read, I like that. Everything that happens flows nicely. I am able to follow her actions and understand everything that is happening.\nTwo thing that I dont like. The biggest one is that your chapters are WAY to short. It was getting annoying to constantly click the next button. Especially since I was enjoying your art. You should merge every 3 chapters together.\nThe next thing was that your main character wasn’t expressive enough. She seemed way to calm in every situation, even as she was about to be swallowed up. It made me care about her less. And made me feel detached from the story.', 'But other than those to things I really enjoyed it, and liked your art and story. Keep up the hard work', ""Thanks for the response! I made my comic in traditional format before I knew about the whole mobile thing. I'm definitely gonna switch to a longer episodic form for my next project. I appreciate your thoughts on my lead character too. Characterization and expression is another thing I'm struggling with as well."", 'Trying searching anime expressions. Use those as a reference that’s what helmoed me!', 'Forgive me, I\'ll be reviewing this really quickly on a short page to page basis, and mostly focusing on story/writing:\n-Immediately, you should let things kind of stretch out a little more, it was a weird transition of character arriving to building, to suddenly being at the beach for a page, and then immediately in (what I\'m assuming) a dorm. Her roommate who she hasn\'t met yet, but still has main characters phone number and is acting casually is a little weird especially since they haven\'t met and the main character hasn\'t actually been established yet. We get the roommates name before the main character is even introduced. Pg 1-6 \n-The flow seems kind of rushed she\'s walking down the street, black shadow thing trips her, she doesn\'t seem all that interested based on her body language and how relaxed she is about it. Finally when it starts to surround her she immediately gives in and does nothing until deus ex machina appears to fix it and immediately disappears.  Personally some more world building would be more appreciated as your characters are already anthropomorphic and the idea of supernatural things being weird was never established outside of her walk to the cafe she\'s going to. pg 7-16\n-I think you meant to say ""Same here, but don\'t stress out too much"" Ch2 Pg 2\n-It was kind of weird that this purple haired girl kind of just shows up talks to the main character for a little bit, doesn\'t introduce herself at all, gives her a coupon to a coffee shop and then leaves. I imagine she\'ll introduce herself later, but it just seemed like a weird conversation Ch2 Pg 9-12\n-The fight scene felt a little anti climactic with almost no risk, I\'m not sure if it\'s all in the characters head, and if it isn\'t I\'m lost as to how the environment is effected by the two Gods fighting each other. The character just kind of brushes it off and pretends nothing happen which seems a little off for most people. More character development like the talk about Akina\'s dad would be more helpful to understand her character. Just from these two chapters alone my only real thought about her is that she\'s overly optimistic and casually ignores severe issues. For your future project I do highly recommending building your character up at least give the audience a better idea of them before the main plot comes out. Ch2 Pg 17-26\n-One final note that can be said for all of the pages in general, I\'m reading this on desktop and some text bubbles are really hard to read.\nThis is all I have time for as I have my own work to try and work on the next couple days. You can take my critique with a grain of salt, it\'s mostly observations I observed reading through, and if you want I can try continuing the rest of the chapters later if you\'d like.\nHowever I don\'t want to end this seeming like I\'m here to put you down so I will give you some positives, even though it isn\'t immediately established I think the world itself is nice, I think your art is pleasant to look at. While I personally felt like things were moving too fast, I know some people prefer a quickly paced comic for the most part.\nKeep doing your best! 100 pages is still a lot to be proud of, and the more you write and make pages, the more you\'ll improve!\nSkipping posting my ref since I can\'t read all 7 chapters right now.', 'I only came up to episode 20 but here are my thoughts\nChapter 1.2: I\'m not quite sure how entering a building leads the character to a beachChapter 1.3: Presumably that\'s her roommate\'s stuff?

At the time I started writing, I was afraid of unnatural character introductions. Like how in some anime, the characters' name would appear at the bottom of the screen or there'd be a side character who exist as a living wiki article of all the main cast. I know in real life sometimes people just forget to intro each other,  but I realized that just led to people not really knowing who my characters are. Oops\nThe thing with the gods is something that's explained as the comic goes on. Basically any mortal lifeforms within the universe can't comprehend the existence of the gods. Akina is a god herself which is why she can see them, but at this moment she thinks it's in her head. I probably could've established it better by having her attempt to talk to more people about it. \nIf you want to check out the other chapters, you can,  I'd definitely appreciate it. But if you have other obligations, don't force yourself."", ""Thanks for your feedback! I'll admit Akina does seem way to nonchalant about the supernatural. I should've given her more expressions and interactions with other characters. \nI guess the roommate thing was a bit more weird than I thought. At the university I went to, students were paired with roommates before moving in. We found each other on social media, exchanged numbers, and kept in contact so we knew who was bringing the tv, futon, microwave, etc. We didn't meet in person until move in day. It's possible that not every school does this so that might be why people find this weird."", ""Oh I see! At my uni, I only met my room mate when I moved in. I guess it's different everywhere!\nHere is up to episode 33:\nChapter 2.9: Does the attendance list have any relevance to the story? Not sure about the purpose of this chapterChapter 2.10: Why is she a slacker? She even arrived early.

Shouldn't they fall into a panic and hurry to evacuate?"", 'You dont really need a cliché exposition dump to show a character, just having them do things like you have her doing in the beginning of ch. 3 is easier to get a better understanding of her character than in ch. 1. Just doing mundane things feels more natural and can tell an audience a lot, I know she has a like for cute and Decorative things now.\nC3 pg 10-11 has a weird transition between being in a bakery and then shes in class, she bumps into a green haired boy whos both in the bakery and her class, and I kind of got lost as to where she ultimately was.\nWhile it isnt bad, ch3 felt somewhat more structured and tells me more about whats actually going on than the previous two chapters did. I did find the part with the smoothie place a little weird that she didnt know purple haired girl worked there despite her telling her in the previous chapter, but im throwing that into Akina possibly being air headed as a character trait\nA little off putting how nonchalant she is about having magical powers, but by her nonchalant attitude towards everything else thats happening Im putting it down to character trait\nCh4 pg5 i think her reaction to her vision is more natural than her reaction to just die in ch1 here. The fact that she has a reaction is nice and feels realistic is good.\nCh4 pg15-16 no explanations or even a build up, the audience is just forced to accept that nonchalant attitude too. This could have been a build up moment to draw in excitement or intrigue, but it just goes into explanation and Akina just going with it without the audience ever really seeing her emote or think about whats going on.\nIts all I got for tonight, im only able to do this because work is slow today, building up to something is really key, it admitedly was kind of a let down that as an audience a somewhat normal girl doesnt have much of a reaction or opinion about the big reveal that was supposed to come. You can take time and build up to things is all Ill say.\nArts improved a lot since Ch1 and 2', ""Holy crap! I had no idea the text was that small. I don't know how I missed that"", ""Hey! I'm actually a reader of your comic already, and if you wanna talk about auditing your comic marketing/making in general, I'd be down to do so, but I usually do this kind of thing in private since I think it's a little easier/nicer and I can give you more personal attention and feedback.

(heavy swearing)\nTRIGGER WARNING: This story can be depressing, contains broken people...\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst review:@thoughtbubbles \nWebcomic Title: Kill Your Darlings (a title I find very funny in a constructive criticism context)Compliments: The way movement is captured is fantastic! I also love the way you draw fighting effects and explosions, smoke, etc. I thought that information about the world was introduced in a very well paced way after the cold open, everything is revealed in it\'s own time with no ""as you know"" exposition dumps. The way way information about maroon is given to us in her personal life vs during the fight is a great dichotomy.Criticism: I thought that her crush kind of came out of no where a little bit, It might get explained later and I just don\'t know yet, but it seemed kind of rushed into the story. (But I\'m Grayromantic, so take my word with a grain of salt) some more insight into her thought procession might make this feel a little more natural. I don\'t know your schedule or workload, but if practical (only if practical for you!) you might want to invest in just a little bit more detail in your outdoor backgrounds and shots.

My Work/s: in their own post', 'Webcomic Title: Kill Your Darlings \nCompliments: Nice character design and good grasp of anatomy. The bold outlines on your characters really make them stand out against the backgrounds. Action panels have a nice sense of motion to them. Overall a funny and unusual beginning to a superhero story.\nCriticism: The text is difficult to read in some of the panels, and ironically, there is one panel where your superhero\'s arms appear to be a little short (though I have longer than average arms so my views on this might be skewed). Not sure how your superhero is able to gauge how old or attractive the villain is given the full face mask, but that\'s the kind of thing I could probably suspend disbelief on, if I wasn\'t reading it for a critique. Minor grammatical issue with the line ""I wanted to take you out on a coffee or something"". I would go with either ""for a coffee"" or ""on a coffee date"". Also suspect the word you were looking for was ""murmur"" instead of ""mummer"". \nOverall I think you\'re doing a great job with the stuff that really matters.

I can easily tell that Thesis and Agony are grumpy, but they obviously know each other well enough/have enough chemistry to be kinda sassy towards each other.\n\nCriticism:\nThis is a personal preference but for the dialogue, you don\'t necessarily have to end it with ""said the man"" or ""said the woman."" The readers can usually infer who is the speaker through verbal cues (like vocabulary usage and attitude) and logic (who was the speaker just before the reply). In fact, I would also recommend you to experiment and take off the ""said"" parts entirely and replace it with actions.

From your first episode, I noticed that you tend to write all of your descriptions for an object/subject in one sentence. While I loved the description that this storm wasn\'t the typical kind you would expect to animate a corpse from, it was hard to read. Rephrasing the sentence/adding more commas/separating one big sentence into smaller ones would definitely make it more digestible for readers.Remember. Short sentence bursts are impactful.

I really love the world-building you\'ve put into place. The way you introduce us to the world is very gradual and not info-dumpy at all. You definitely take advantage of the scene we\'re already placed in to make any exposition feel like a natural progression. The way you describe food is wonderful (I want snowberry jam lol). I also liked reading about Novus\' relationship with his family and friends. I can\'t wait to learn more about Novus as a person, since right now, he seems quite ordinary (which can be good. Ordinary people getting put in extraordinary situations is always fun). All of your descriptions are generally very good! I also love that Novus has a huge motivation and seems to be very active in achieving his goal of creating a school.\nCriticism: IDK if this is just me, but one aspect that stood out to me was the way you frame dialogue. There\'s a lot of languages that put dialogue in between dashes (- I hate Mondays -), but it might help to go with quotation marks instead, since that\'s how most stories in English tend to go (""I hate Mondays,"" said Novus.) It\'s not really that one is better than the other, but people tend to view quotation marks as more professional and correct and that\'s always a plus.  Most of your readers will probably be more familiar with quotation marks instead of em-dashes. Again, this might just be my editing background getting in the way. It\'s hard for me to get invested in a story that doesn\'t follow the grammar rules I\'ve come to understand. There were also a few grammar errors that took me out of the story at times but it wasn\'t anything too major. \nOther than the dialogue, I thought everything else about your story was interesting. I\'m glad you included a glossary, since defining words in the text itself can be a bit distracting. It also makes it feel even more like a traditionally published fantasy novel!\nMy Work/s: Here\'s mine! Any critiques are very welcome.

I don’t know if it’s simply a stylistic choice or if you have an actual reason for doing so, but the way you replaced the quotation marks with dashes was kinda confusing.\nAlways make a new paragraph when a new character is speaking. When the mom called Novus a snowberry cake and told him to get up, that should’ve been a new paragraph because you started that paragraph with Novus speaking. I’m not a writer myself, so I’m not sure I’m right, but I think you also have to line break when a different character does a new action. I would recommend you to study up on dialogue format. \nShow and not tell! You do this pretty well already but there were places where the writing could’ve been upgraded significantly if it was just shown instead (especially when showing things to the readers makes the novel more immersive, which is what I want to do when reading a fantasy novel like yours). One example would be how you described Tiria’s love of cooking/her job. I love this character detail and it tells us so much about her, but you could’ve written this part from the perspective of Novus. For example, Novus notices the scent of his mother’s cooking, the excess amount of food she has made(out of love for her boy and love of cooking), notes how he hasn’t eaten his mother’s food in a while, and thanks her for taking time off from her job to do this for him.\n', ""Webcomic Title: Kill Your Darlings @thoughtbubbles \nCompliments:I personally am a fan of the more sketch like drawing style, so little biased for this comic lol.I also love awkward interactions because I feel it makes the story a bit more real life. \nCriticism:The words look slightly blurry on bubble that aren't meant to be (might be because I'm on a computer)Maybe add some pops of color to draw the readers eye to important things\nMy Work/s:\n\ntapas.io6\n\n\n\nFull Moon King (FMK) | Tapas\nSilver Heart is a teen with a checkered past.

It might totally work with the tone your going for for the rest of the story, but I can only read what\'s there so far.

61,Advice on a Starting Paragraph,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I've been rereading my story a lot to tweak some things that need tweaking. Recently, I've decided that my current starting paragraph is a bit too exposition-heavy and doesn't do a lot to hook people into the current story. I don't want to be overly expository, but I do enjoy a bit of background information every now and then. I'm looking for some advice on how I should approach this or whether I should keep what I already have.
My current draft posted here actually has two different opening paragraphs: one from an introduction, and one from chapter 1. Here they are respectively:
Current (Introduction)

I blame the Romans—generally speaking. How unfortunate that the word for “left side” has evolved into the word for “evil.” Language evolves in sinister ways.
Twenty-two years ago, I began writing a series of journals that I called Aberdeen’s Anthology. It vividly recounted the horrid histories behind some of the most sinister people. Marion Marley lived off the thrill of terrorizing people. Mark Twain succumbed his readers to a tragic natural death of excruciating boredom. Howard Heim managed to eat an entire batch of poisonous cookies he himself had baked and claimed to feel fine afterwards. Chuck Nietzsche, Friedrich’s lesser-known brother, had killed Ra, just as his brother had killed God, in an effort to one-up him.

Current (Chapter 1)
The town of Plainwood weaved like a figure-eight around a range of frosty, pine-covered mountains called the Monnellians. It was about the size of Monaco and had a population of no more than 2,000. Everybody knew each other, which was good, since no one would ever get a chance to meet anyone else otherwise. While technically within the borders of Washington state, it was so far to the northwest and covered by so many veils and thick borders that it practically separated itself from everything else. A sovereign city-state, one would say, unrecognized and unknown by many other governments. There was no need to leave nor was there any to enter. For this reason, everyone spent their whole life in Plainwood, and they were content with it. Everybody grew up together. Every generation was its own inseparable posse—whether they could stand someone or not. Luckily, everybody had their own intertangled Venn diagram of relations, where they could easily move from group to group, even if some pieces of one group rubbed off into another.


But now I'm considering whether I should keep or get rid of the introduction, as well as whether to change chapter 1's opening paragraph.
I drafted four different candidates for chapter 1:
Idea 1
As one of the only four people to live in the notorious Riverside Road, Eileen Pritchett found it disappointing that only now did she receive her first hideous encounter. Still, she was as worried as anyone else who received their first hideous encounter.
Idea 2
Eileen Pritchett spent most of her night tossing and turning on her couch. Her sleeping on the couch had nothing to do with her hideous encounter from last night, though it was convenient that the couch was right there. She had always heard her friends and family talk about hideous encounters and had always felt a combination of smugness and disappointment for never having one herself. After all, not only did she live on Riverside Road, but she also lived in the house with the statue of the hand on it.
Idea 3 (This is already a paragraph in my current draft, but is not at the exact start)
Eileen Pritchett was a young woman of thirty-one years, a hundred thirty pounds, and five feet nine inches. She had been crashing on her couch not because it was the closest place to sleep after her encounter last night but because she found it much more comfortable than her king-sized bed in the master bedroom. She had spent the night tossing and turning, as shown by her long auburn hair strewn everywhere and from her t-shirt and leggings rolled up as far as they could go.
Idea 4 (Less Eileen-centric and more about the person behind her ""hideous encounter""--who is equally important) (This is also an existant paragraph in my current draft)
A young woman trudging through the woods found herself by a lightly flowing stream. Seeing her reflection was the perfect jarring wakeup call she needed to enter a pensive state of reflection as well. Natalie looked into her aqua blue eyes, lost in thought and memories, but mostly lost in herself. She could never get used to the sight of her own face. She looked at the person on the other side of the water: the pretty, innocent-looking, dark-haired, dark-complexioned girl. She smirked at her in disbelief, doubtful that this was the same person who had lived such a roller-coaster of a life that she only barely had enough tickets to ride. She looked up at the sky and shivered. There were birds in the sky cackling, and she couldn’t help but think it was directed towards her. She looked down at the valley and almost lost her balance at the thought of how high up she had gotten. She cupped her hands to get a drink from the stream. Then she jumped across, almost falling in, but only getting up to her shins wet. The wind was strong, the air was cold, and the trees were rustling. She quickly sidestepped in fear when a gnarled old trunk fell over.","['Just my personal opinion, but I like a story to start with some actions or events to hook the readers so naturally, I’d choose idea 4. Instead of having Eileen just tossing and turning on the couch doing nothing (even if it is important) at the beginning of the story, I’d rather you tell more about the ‘hideous encounter.’ Hope this help somewhat.', ""Idea 2 is a very good opener, and there's opportunity to segue into the descriptions of the 'hideous encounter' in idea 4."", ""I liked your introduction, but it did remind me a little of satire. I guess, that's to say, I found it a little humorous--in a good way. I used to start my stories with introductions, but ended up tossing them later when they didn't really do anything for the story. So, I guess, if you feel the introduction will be relevant and properly set up the story, then you should keep it. If not, maybe you can use parts of it elsewhere? \nIdea 2 and 4 seemed the most engaging to me. They both put you in the middle of a mysterious event. 2 gives it a little more of that slow build up, while 4 seems to throw you right in. Hope this is helpful.  Good luck with your story!"", ""Thank you all of you!\nI liked your introduction, but it did remind me a little of satire. I guess, that's to say, I found it a little humorous--in a good way.\nThat's on purpose. My narrator has a very dry sense of humor\nSo, I guess, if you feel the introduction will be relevant and properly set up the story, then you should keep it. If not, maybe you can use parts of it elsewhere?\nThe info from the introduction is definitely going to unfold later throughout the story, though probably much more spaced out and gradually than the introduction. I do like the very first opening line in it though. Maybe I'll drop the intro and just keep that line as a quick blurb before the actual story starts."", ""I actually also just had the idea of instead using the introduction as a back-cover summary-type thing. I think it's perfect for that"", ""Sounds like a great idea! I've seen a few different authors do that. Like it's a note from the main character/narrator, but doesn't actually appear in the story. "", ""I like idea 4 most and here's why.\nThe difference between all of the other introductions and this one is that idea four jumps right into some kind of action. Information that you will find in the exposition can always come later. \nIf you want to hook your readers, start the story in the middle of some kind of conflict. Idea four leans closest to this 'concept'. We don't have to read about the background of the story yet. it's nice and simple and sparks the idea 'what is she doing by the river, alone, in the cold?' You want your first sentence (introduction) to pull in your readers, you can tell if you've done it right if it leaves a question in the minds of your readers.\nAlso, especially in the exposition when information about the setting of the story is concentrated, keep it simple. There are specific details the reader's don't need to know. It's okay to let them come upon their own conclusions about the background of the story, later on you can confirm them when the story isn't barraged with information. You don't need to feel like your readers NEED to know ALL OF THIS INFORMATION to enjoy the story. For example, in idea 3, you give a brief description of your character right off the bat. As the first sentence of your WHOLE book, that's not really a strong beginning, is it? It's a detail you can let your readers figure for themselves when you write about how maybe Eileen nearly hit her head on the door frame because she was 'taller' than most. You get what I'm saying?\nHere's how you can make it simple, before writing each chapter, make a list of things that the readers MUST know before starting the next chapter. Do they need to know Eileen Pritchett was a hundred thirty pounds or that she's never experienced a hideous encounter? What do the readers need to know to ENJOY the story? In this case, it sounds like the latter is much more crucial.\nAt the end of the day, I can tell you are a strong writer that loves their details and that's okay. I can tell you put in a lot of time world-building and that's also okay! It's even more okay that at the end of the book, your reader's won't know EVERYTHING about the world and its characters like you will. We can only write what will make our stories more enjoyable!\nHope this helps! Good luck!"", ""Thank you so much! That really helps not only for just this, but as good advice for the rest of my writing! I appreciate you taking the time to write such a helpful and detailed response. I just modified my first chapter, and I couldn't help but think back to this thread when I was done!"", ""Haha! I'm glad I was able to help you out!

So in celebration of Pride Month, I'm releasing a new book, and I just wanted to know what people thought of the cover. If you saw this, would you or would you not want to read it, and why? 
I'm aware that its silly and ....""childishly adult,"" but that's sort of what I was going for since the stories it'll feature will be adult but kinda vulgar, silly, and childish at times. If you like it, let me know why. Or if you don't like it, let me know why. Any suggestions on things to add or change are also welcome.","[""My honest opinion? Personally it doesn't really speak to me. Maybe it's the color combination or the wiggly lines, but I think you should try making multiple covers and experiment with the placement of the icons, balance is really important in art. The thicker lines in the hot dog is a bit heavy compared to the rest and there's a lot of yellow at the bottom half, so maybe play around with colors too. The banana with the dark lines also weirdly bothers me. But I like the title, I just think the coloring is reminding me of Netflix.\nOverall? I like the concept + minimalistic design, I wouldn't usually read anything vulgar or 18+ but I enjoy reading anthologies so this would be a maybe ◡̈⃝"", 'Thanks, and I see what you mean about it reminding you of Netflix. I actually had a version with a lot more stripes that probably would have been even closer to Netflix too lol, but you have some good points that I can look into.', 'I think the props should either be behind the title or hanging from the letters, and you might want to change the background color. Other then that, it looks good!', 'There are quite a few issues I see here, none of them are critical mistakes but just make this cover less appealing compared others.\nEvery block of text has a different font/scheme: the author is all caps, the title is all caps w/ a different font, and the bottom ""volume"" text is in mixed case. I would shrink/abbreviate the ""volume 1"" text to ""VOL. 1"" and place it into the corner while making the font much smaller. I also suggest outright replacing the secondary (author/volume) font, as it seems like a generic/default font. I like the contrast between the two fonts, and I would keep it that way.\nI\'m not a big fan of the waves, but I\'m not really sure what I would replace them with. I tend not to split my covers into sections, and keep everything onto one ""section"" of sorts. \nThe background also feels a bit empty, despite the good mix of negative and positive space. I would fill the background with something other than just plain white. You could make a grid of the small drawings w/ a light opacity and fill the background that way.\nI don\'t really understand the two yellow circles and would consider removing/replacing them.\nI would also stay away from pure white/black, and instead replace it with a lighter color/darker color. I would also consider creating a color palette/limiting colors.\nTLDR: Keep text consistent, change the volume/author text to something less generic, fill the background, create and stick to a color palette, stay away from using pure white/black, and remove the two yellow circles.\nThe overall layout/idea is solid and I enjoy it, but it could have been done better.', 'I can see what you mean with a few things.

The only issue I see here is that the ""love stories"" part from the original cover is shrunk, and from far away, makes it look like the title is just saying ""stupid gay.""', 'this cover reads as  STUPID GAY. seems to be the opposite message of the actual book.', ""for me it's a bit difficult to read books, but I would totally read it if I got the time and concentration (or on a day I was ill or something) it looks fun and fresh too. About the desingn the only thing I see kind of strange is the name of the author, it's a buit too big, I'd do it a bit smaller; but I wouldn't change anything else"", ""oh lol, I personally liked the original quite better and yes, the title can lead to missinterpretations  but it's my personal opinion only"", 'Yeah I went ahead and changed the title from ""Stupid Gay Love Stories,"" to just ""Stupid Gay"" and added a little sub text that explained it contains love stories.', 'Yeah I changed the title from ""Stupid Gay Love Stories,"" to ""Stupid Gay"" and added a little sub text that explained it contains love stories. I feel the shorter name is better because its more abrasive, and the stories themselves are kinda abrasive at points. But also if the name is enough to get you to stop and look at the cover I\'m betting it wont take much for a person to notice the little note that explains it contains sometimes immature stories.', 'I\'ll admit the name change is a bit of a gamble, but I think it\'s worth it. Plus I was using it like how people say ""that\'s stupid cool"" or ""that\'s stupid crazy"" . Here stupid just means a lot, crazy, fun, or zany. So its ""A Lot of Gay= Stupid Gay"" or ""Crazy Gay = Stupid Gay"". Explaining the joke/slang kinda takes the funny out a little, but I still have faith in it. I\'ve asked a few of my gay friends if they liked it and they said they did, and I myself am bisexual, so I\'m trusting that other people will get it. Or if someone doesn\'t get it, they\'ll read the sub text I wrote and it\'ll make things more clear. \nThat being said, I did sorta like my original more too, but after getting feedback, I felt while it was good to be abrasive in some places,  I could stand to dial it back in others.', 'The sub text is awfully small, so it might turn off potential readers who have seen a small thumbnail of the cover that is too small for them to read the text.', ""Hmmmm, it might be small compared to the main title, but its actually 12pt which is standard size for most text. \nStill, I do get what you're trying to say. It's a gamble to hope that people will get the slang/joke and if they don't get it I'm then hoping that they'll read long enough to get the big picture. But I see it like this, I can play it safe and have a title that leaves nothing to chance or go with something that's abrasive and impactful. Even if no one likes this version of the name, or it throws a few people off, I doubt anyone who sees it will forget it as easily as the previous version. In fact I'm willing to bet people who have an immediate bad reaction will want to know more about it which could in turn help me out even more. \nIt's all a gamble. \nBut would you read it I wonder?"", ""oh, I didn't know! maybe because english is not my native languageWish you luck!""]",6/11/2021 18:43,https://forums.tapas.io/t/lookking-for-honest-opinions-book-cover/60154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let me know what you think of my blurbs. If you have suggestions, let me know as well.  They're for a back of a book. That's why they're longer than blurbs/story descriptions for novels in Tapas.

Will he continue to be the light to her sad world, or will he be the reason for Katelyn’s unbearable heartbreak? The same reason as how her parents’ love for each other fell apart. Katelyn is sure there’s one who can she trust the most, only her heart.

I had to re-read it twice before I realized what the phrasing was implying. Just because 'sorrowful' and 'broken' precede it, my brain kinda auto-lumped 'horrors' in with the description of her people's current situation, rather than the solution she is seeking to that situation. Maybe just capitalizing the title 'Horrors of the World' would be enough to make that phrase stand out to me.\nWill you buy the comic/novel?I might, I might not, I'd need a little more info from the blurb (or the time to sit down and read the first chapter) to determine if it's my preferred type of fantasy or not (I like big adventure-y stuff with hard magic systems and complicated histories and politics), but there's enough intrigue and the cover is downright GORGEOUS enough that there would definitely be enough interest to flip through the first few pages and see if it has the flavor I'm looking for."", ""\n000 T.png768x1152 681 KB\n\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nInterstellar Hero: Nova Ranger | Tapas\nOkay, so... turns out aliens exist.

","[""I like your story so far from the first episode, the only thing I wish, as if it was a little bit meatier and had more fine details but that might just be picky. I have a few things that might help:\n\nI feel like you give a little too much away in the description. I wasn't aware there was an accident and that's how they became lovers, I felt like I needed to read more and earn that little tidbit. Simplify it a little better and make people come back for more, for example, just cut it off when you mention the Accident, people would be intrigued about it and click on the story.\nYour cover doesn't have anything to do with Volleyball. If that's what the story revolves around and it brings the characters together, there should be at least a hint of it in the cover art. like maybe they are in their uniforms or one of them is holding a ball.\n\nHopes this helps!"", ""Ah thank you! I appreciate you reading for me! I just updated the cover today so perfect timing. The cover has the elements of volleyball and shows exactly what it had been missing before! And about the descriptions, do you mean that I shouldn't include anything about the accident and fate? This is what I had rewritten for the description:\nIf there was one thing Jayden Powell understood about his rival, it had to be that his rival -absolutely with all of his heart and everything in him- despised him. Nine-hundred, ninety-nine percent, Kousuke Olsen would rather cut his own arm off and eat it than be caught in the same room as Jayden. Despite it all, Jayden didn't mind. In fact, you may even say, he reveled in it. He lived for it. \nIt was the beginning of his last year of high school however, when he found out that those days might never return again. Suddenly, Jayden was finding that very quickly, everything was changing out of form. The hour-long volleyball matches, being on the other side of the court as him, having those intelligent, dark eyes on him at all times; they were being taken away by a force called 'fate'.  \nIn a tragic love-story, two boys, Jayden Powell and Kousuke Olsen, find each other and then they find each other again... Just...In different circumstances... \nWarning, depictions of death. This novel has content that may be sensitive to others, for example sexual-harassment. This novel is contains foul language of that befitting teenagers but please be advised that this is intended for mature audiences. \nAll art belongs to @Alyek_K on Instagram!"", 'YES!

I hope that's enough lol","['As a reader and as a fellow creator that have followed you and your developing I will like to give some feedback to help you out.\nYour art have always been great in my eyes, especial your color, but you were not ready for the high-class to make it your living, as some pro artist have told you. This you indeed have taken to heart and this new art is a huge leap towards your goal. Great work.\nBut what send me off from your work was not the art, but the writing, it became boring to me.I\'m not a high-class writer yet, but I do believe that I\'m very good at is being a storyteller.\nIn my journey to become a writer I have learned that a good story is not written one step at the time, but written forward, backward and over and over and over again, until it becomes good.\nEvery update has to point to goals, give valuable information to the reader and make them care for the characters and what is going on so they want to know more.Ask yourself when you have written an episode, what did the reader learned and was it exiting enough for them to know more?\nWhen I read your first episode, all I learn is that there is a new kid fighting someone begging for his life. But I have no valuable information of what kind of fight this is and why I should care about that fight? Is this fight even that dangerous or was the other person just easy scared. Who of the two in the fight do I have to care about?\nA way of fixing this could be that someone else stops the fight. Ref or spectator saying ""This is enough!"" And telling why this was over the top. Maybe having a girlfriend begging for the other kids life.This will give the reader information that a line was crossed and the story are about a strong new kid that we should fear  and not the story about a weak person being beating up easy.\nI hope you will succeed and that you will give the world some great beautiful stories.', ""Thank you, I'm glad you think the has improved. \nAnd yes, I admit my writing skills were.. horrible. It may also be like that, because I didn't write the whole script for the chapter, before starting. I did that now and actually send the script with small previews of the pages to people, so I can get feedback on it, so I can avoid the mistakes I made.\nI am still looking for more people who could review it, if you are interested, would you like to read it? I would send you a link in DM, I would appreciate your opinion on it "", 'I hope your break was a refreshing one. It looks like there\'s improvement going on here, so well done for sticking it out and applying yourself.\nI have four main areas I\'d suggest for you to focus on, and I\'ll try to be as clear as possible.\nColour saturation and value:Some of these images are hard to make out details on or a bit garish to look at because the colours are often very dark; so dark that it\'s hard to see the black line art any more. Human eyes are a lot better at differentiating differences between light shades than dark ones, so if you try to get into the habit of making dark blues a bit lighter and the black of a black shirt actually be a dark grey or dark greyish blue or purple, you\'ll find the figures become easier to read. Some of the blues and greens are a bit uncomfortably bright, so I\'d recommend toning down the saturation on those a little. RGB monitors can display extremely vibrant shades or blue and green, and it\'s easy to have them look a bit plastic-like or uncomfortable on the eyes. I often find that rather than pure RGB ""forest green"" it often looks nicer to use shades more like lime, moss or teal.\nVolume:This is probably the biggest area where you can make improvements, and for a lot of people this is the big line that they need to cross to go from amateur to pro in quality.It looks like you\'re getting pretty confident with the proportions of the body, so your next step forward is going to be to do with mastering the depth of the body and making it feel like it\'s a solid, three-dimensional object with the muscles bulging in the right places, and then with fabric wraps around over the top of that, creasing appropriately. I highly recommend looking at the work of artists like Hiromu Arakawa (Fullmetal Alchemist), Kouhei Horikoshi (My Hero Academia) and Stuart Immonen (various Marvel titles, one of my faves is All New X-Men) because they\'re extremely good at this. Doing anatomical studies of people wearing clothes and just generally practicing lots and deconstructing art you like will help you push towards this goal.\nLine Weight:The lines are consistently quite thick, and have the smoothing turned up very high. Some artists can pull off this look, but they tend to have much less detailed characters than you\'re aiming for and a more cartoony feel (examples would be people like Bryan Lee O\'Malley or Bruce Timm). I\'d recommend a combination of either trying to streamline your character designs, reducing the brush size of your inking line tool a little or experimenting with either a tool with more pressure-controlled line-art variation or swapping between a thicker ""outline"" line brush and a finer ""detail"" one.\nExpressions:You have a tendency to draw characters with their eyes always very wide, with the whites of the eye showing around most of the pupils, and also ""cross-eyed"" with their eyes both at the inward corners as if they\'re looking at their nose. The smiles tend to be a bit excessively smiley too, with a very exaggerated curl at the corners. The overall effect is that the characters tend to look a bit silly or goofy.I like the more subdued expression on the face of the girls in green, so maybe try drawing a variety of expressions, or do those ""expression meme"" template challenges that are popular online. They can be really good for working out how to approach a variety of emotions within a consistent style.\nBest of luck!', ""Let's talk. I send you a DM"", ""Thank you so much for the feedback. And I agree with everything you say, these are things that I still try to figure out.\nWhen it comes to colors, I try to find more tame colors that are more pleasant for the eyes. I also started to play with color filters and looks like they sometimes don't go well with some colors. The shirt is normaly dark grey, or lighter black, soemthing like it, but the filter made it almost totally black and too dark to see aynthing. so now I know I have to keep eye on it and also edit some colors.\nWhen it comes to volume, i am still trying to learn anatomy and how to show the volume. I am actually a big fan of Fullnmetal alchemist and very often look into manga, because art is so well done. I also use photos and refferences to learn how to draw clothes and bodies and will continue with it.\nLineart is something that just bothers me. I feel like my drawings have the most life to them when they are made as sketch without lineart. Like the second drawing with colors and the girl. when i mke lineart, I always feel like the lines are not as pretty and are too thick. So I guess, I'm not the only one who doesn't like how they look. I'll try to mke them thinner, i think it goes better with my shading and lighting than thick ones. \nAnd yes, head and eyes are still something that I try to figure out. Very often it looks like the face is flat and doesn't have enough dimension to it. And the eyes are totally another level. i will keep those thing in mind.\nAgain, thank you so much "", 'Hey you are getting better all the time, and I think I\'ve told you before that it\'s great to see your constant improvement. You got some suggestions already, so I\'ll add some more 5 cents. \n-Line Quality: You may want to look into S-curves and character design to make sure that your characters pop and feel distinct while still being familiar. The way that we compose our characters professionally is by thinking about every line and making stylized choices (even in realism we do a lot of stylization because art isn\'t real, and we have to do things to trick people\'s eyes) but it\'s hard for us to explain what we\'re doing since we sort of do it without thinking about it. People sometimes think that only female characters have S-curves, but that isn\'t really true, all characters do, from humans to animals. Also, all character design has balance and contrasts in it to make it more appealing.\nSo if we look at Character model sheets, you\'ll notice that creators often leave notes as to why they made the choices they made while making their characters \n\nimage.png744x564 153 KB\n\nSo for Batman here, Bruce Tim will contrast curves on one side of the arm with straight on the other. He\'s thinking about his design as something in motion so that we get as much punch as possible when Batman punches.\nSo it may be a good exercise to look up those character model sheets (sometimes called character bibles) to see what you can implement for your own characters. They\'re wonderful recourses that are often available online if you do the right google search.\n\nimage.png1466x1200 111 KB\n\nAlso, if they don\'t have notes, you\'ll see that character model sheets also have just a lot of different expressions and angles to faces, and this is mostly so we can give an idea of how our character looks in motion--and sometimes it also tells us what angles just don\'t work in our designs, which I find endlessly helpful as I draw my own stuff, Sometimes I just gotta know which characters can\'t be seen head on.\nimage.png1218x1609 671 KB\n\nSo while I may not personally do a ton of character studies before doing a comic, I also have a lot of experience so just do as I say and not as I do, and do some character sheets. Loosen your arm a bit, pull out a sketchy pencil since no drawing sacred (and in these sheets they shouldn\'t take long to draw, you\'re not making polished art with character sheets), and really stretch their expressions. It really helps with line quality, which is sometimes just a confidence thing, where we have to feel more confident drawing the character and the only way to do that is practice in a safe un-judged environment.\nThe other thing is stylizing the character movement. If you are using a 3d program to do this, it can help, but it can also hinder because fight scenes are stylized. They have ""stretch and squash"" which is an animation term meaning that you stretch anatomy to make it look like motion is happening. So studying artist who are king at stylizing action can help a lot--but I don\'t know what you\'re aiming for, but even searching like ""action pose animation fighting"" gives some pretty good examples of people who\'ve pushed their line of action through what is ""correct but stiff anatomy"" and into ""this is a fluid body in motion.""\n\nimage.png594x960 536 KB\n\nLike you\'ll notice that this person (man I wish I knew their name, thanks Google image search) sometimes goes a little beyond what the human body can do in favor of their line of action--you have to be careful with this, because you don\'t want your person to look broken, but if you find the balance you\'ll have a lot of really fun fight scenes.', 'Things I think you\'re doing well: It\'s clear that you\'re really trying to make your work more dynamic and you don\'t shy away from drawing more difficult poses. It\'s great to see the variety. I think your characters are very expressive and your style is very clean. I really like ""28.jpg"" for the expressiveness in his face and ""5. jpg"" for the composition - really great contrast of big and small shapes with the large creature juxtaposed next to the small characters. \nThings I think you can improve: Some of your poses are feeling static when you translate it into lineart because you\'re losing the line of action. When you draw in the clothing folds, it\'s also making it more static because it\'s interrupting the line of action and because the clothing folds are very evenly spaced, giving it a more marshmallow effect. For now, because of your style, I might suggest just simply removing most of the clothing folds. (I also have a hard time with clothing folds.) \nHere\'s an example of what I mean:\ntapashelp.jpg2000x1255 267 KB\n\n(Sidenotes: I also made the head a bit smaller in relation to the shoulders and set the eyes farther apart. The general rule is that the space between the two eyes should be about the size of the eye itself.)', ""Sorry for such a late reply, I'm a snail. \nthank you so much for all the tips, it really opens my eyes. I was always trying to keep things more realistic, but I start to understand that making things more simple and cartoony may not be a bad thing. so right now I try to implement some shape language and find a way how to draw with simple shapes, but I guess it takes some time :,D\n\n49.jpg1134x678 107 KB\n\nThose examples you gave are amazing, thanks for all the tips "", ""Thanks for the compliments \nAnd you are right, I very often feel like my poses are static and it's soemtimes quite hrd to break free from that. And I can totally see where you are going with this. I have to remember that to not do the same mistakes, thank you so much for the tips "", ""Yeah yeah, like doing studies in realism is important for when you have more time per illustration, but when you're doing animation and comics, ain't no ones got time for that. I still do realism and anatomy studies all the time, even taking just a bunch of photo reference for my comic to nail those stylized pieces--but stylization is an artform unto itself that takes a lot of practice to learn how to do the line quality in more of a loose and appealing way and how to design characters that have an interesting composition. There's sometimes this expectation that artists would just know how to do that...but that wasn't the way it was for me, I had to copy what other masters were doing to find what style I wanted for my own art. You'll get there!\nAnd I like how your middle guy here was committed to his lines--you did those in one stroke, which helps give him more energy and clarity than the places where you layered strokes on top of each other (which are rough studies, so I get why they are layered, don't worry). Good luck with the studies!"", ""Yeah, a lot of practice ahead. I tried to take your advice and try to draw my characters with simple shapes, so kinda simplify the drawing and also implement some shape language. So Epsilon is made with a circle and Charlie triangle. I must admit I like these designs more than the old version and I think I start to see what you talk about. I feel like the simple shapes give characters more personality. Do you think it's an improvement? \n\n53.jpg358x846 48.7 KB\n\n54 a.jpg336x883 45.7 KB\n\n54.jpg309x879 41.7 KB\n"", ""O hey that is a lot clearer! The biggest thing is if you are happy with it, but I do like that now it's more streamlined and that the characters feel different from each other (having a round person vs traingle is a good idea). You could go less streamlined or more depending on what your personal end goals are for the project, which I don't really know so I don't want to lead you down a wrong path or anything. It feels like it's leaning more to like a 00's throwback style--which is fun--but you may want to watch and make sure it doesn't look like too flash-animation-ey (I think it's mostly the shapes and fashion is quite 00's, which is having a comeback, but not every part of that fashion is having a comeback. So, you may want to try out some more fashion ideas just so it doesn't date your designs.)\n When I'm personally testing a character design, it helps to draw it out in a range of motions to really see if you like it (especially in an action comic, all character design is meant to be seen in motion.) And to just kinda stretch and experiment. But like--I'm not the say all end all of character design, and there's a range out there of styles to choose from so you may want to dip into those other if you're still at the phase of choosing what direction you want to go."", ""I'm not sure where I head with the style. I grew up with games, anime, and cartoons of 90s and early 2000, but I was never fond of flash animation. I always tried to get in between cartoon and manga style, so I guess I still look for what I want. I just know I want it to be dynamic, organic, colorful, and just fun to look at. This story has a lot of action and fighting, so I guess I should try to develop a style that looks good in motion.\nI also made some action poses as you said. I think the style could work, so right now I try to figure out how to add volume, so characters don't look flat.At least I hope so, lol.\n\n60 small.jpg1600x1600 744 KB\n\n\n61.jpg1534x692 171 KB\n\n\n62.jpg521x894 109 KB\n"", 'Some new stuff\n\n65.jpg774x445 53.5 KB\n\n67.jpg675x717 65.8 KB\n\n68.jpg486x641 63.1 KB\n\n73.jpg562x586 102 KB\n\n64 a.jpg835x868 153 KB\n\n63.jpg940x612 156 KB\n\n74.jpg814x1433 196 KB\n\n71.jpg940x913 291 KB\n\n70.jpg940x1254 256 KB\n\n72.jpg940x1754 495 KB\n']",5/27/2021 8:53,https://forums.tapas.io/t/trying-to-improve-can-i-get-some-feedback/59570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, if she really is such a cooped-up leper, it\'s sort of a miracle she can so much as name the school her sister is going to, much less knows all this stuff about the council. I suspect this has something to do with her supposedly mystical abilities which you haven\'t explained very well so far.

Sengoku Jidai: UNTOLD
follow the adventure of Hiro with his newly found master as they navigate their way through the warring and battle scarred Japan to uncover troublesome mysteries about the death of Oda Nobunaga, along the way they encounter demons that threaten to...





","['Hey,\nI took a look at your first episode and my overall thoughts are that the art is really lovely and atmospheric but the writing is not very strong. Two seconds into reading and I\'m confused. Anytime you introduce names of anything, Characters, Places, or Anything Capitalized, it\'s something the reader has to learn, and I don\'t want to feel like I\'m learning a history lesson. For instance, you have two names right off the bat - Diamyo and Sengoku Jidai - is it important that I know these names? Can\'t it just be battling Warlords? Why do I need to know what the era is called?\nNext, the very first speech bubble, ""nobunaga\'s rein comes to an end tonight"" made me think: Who is Nobunaga? Why isn\'t their name capitalized? I\'m pretty sure this person meant ""reign"" not ""rein"". Is this the main character?\nI keep reading and I\'m still confused. Who\'s Ronin? Who\'s Akechi? I don\'t know who anybody pictured is. Who\'s Daimyo? Wasn\'t it spelled Diamyo earlier? Is Diamyo the same as Daimyo? Who\'s Yasuke? \nI\'m not sure if English is your first language, but I would strongly consider trying to find someone who can be an editor for you if it\'s not. Otherwise, be more careful and double check that you don\'t have simple typos that can distract from the story. That being said, even if the writing was perfectly spelled and grammatically correct, the biggest problem is I have no idea who the characters are in the story. A good general rule of thumb should be to have no more than 2-3 NAMED characters introduced in the first episode. You have at least 5: Nobunaga, Ronin, Akechi, Yasuke, Diamyo? If these characters aren\'t that important, then see if you can tell the story without naming them. And from your summary, it seems like we haven\'t even gotten to the main character yet.\nI hope that didn\'t come off too harshly - I think your story has a lot of potential so I just want to see it be better!', 'Okay, so I don\'t normally give feedback on comics that aren\'t my preferred genres, which this isn\'t, but I am familiar with the era of Japan that it\'s set in, so I thought it might be a good fit. \nFirst off, I agree with @drawnbyyannan that the art is solid and you have good mood-setting happening. I lost track of exactly what was happening, but I think that was due to my own lack of exposure to action comics rather than an issue with the art or pacing. Attractive art is the first thing readers will notice, so strong start. \nMoving on to the writing, Daimyo and Nobunaga didn\'t throw me, but I am the exception to the rule; most people outside of Japan won\'t be familiar with them. However, even knowing those two, I still didn\'t know who anyone was in the first episode (the one labelled 0). I figured out Hiro and the teacher in the second, so that was better.\nMy recommendation would be to remove any names from #0 other than Yasuke, since he seems important. Nobunaga can be ""the ruler,"" Daimyo can be ""warlords"" or ""powerful samurai,"" and the other character names (as well as Sengoku Jidai) can be removed entirely. Just keeping Yasuke will help the reader focus on him and remember him for #1. Sepuku might be okay - I think it\'s fairly well engrained in Western culture, and I understand why it was used. Still, an aside with the definition might be helpful.\nIn addition, a little extra proofreading would serve you well. I was a bit baffled by the change in font between the two episodes; the new font reads like everyone\'s yelling since we weren\'t introduced with an all-caps font. That said, capitalization in #0 was erratic. Nothing a little extra proofreading can\'t help!\nAll in all, I did enjoy the brief intro to Hiro and think he\'s set up well as the protagonist. I\'d be interested to see how he does going forward, even if I don\'t necessarily care about what happens to Yasuke.\nBest of luck!', ""You weren't too harsh, I've been looking for someone who'd help me with the dialogue to proof read that it's okay with no grammar errors\nTHANKS FOR YOUR FEEDBACK!"", ""Thanks for the feedback! Am glad you brought up the font because I was liking and I didn't realize it made all the characters seem as if they're all yelling\nTHANK YOU"", ""other people left some good feed back so i'll just add some of my thoughts:\n-Change font and text size. the texts fill up the text bubbles and feels uncomfortable.-Change your text to default. right now it looks like its in italic.-Use different fonts for different actions and different characters. maybe give the serious ones a thicker font-In the first scene ('after the collapse of emperor's power over Japan') spread out the text boxes further apart. this avoids filling the entire screen with text boxes, even with the same number of words.-Remove unnecessary dialog ('I need some sleep')""]",6/7/2021 10:03,https://forums.tapas.io/t/some-good-old-criticism-could-help-me-get-better/59973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you!","[""Hey there,\nI just took a look at your webtoon and I think your art style is really cool! I really like a more traditional vibe in a webtoon, because it's not done that often.  I took a look at the first and last episode and the main issue I think that needs fixing is establishing your characters in the space. You do a great job of drawing the backgrounds and the characters, but it's kind of confusing where the characters are in relation to each other. I'll use your latest episode, Episode 9, as an example. You show a a bedroom with a bed in it, and then later a boy (not sure his name) jumps into the bed, but I'm not sure where he was standing before that. What would really help is some more overhead/bird's eye shots to show the viewer the whole space and where the two characters are in that space. So that later, when the third character pops in the doorway, we know exactly where everyone is relative to each other. \nBTW, do you read Stagtown? I think you could get a lot of inspiration from that creator in terms of how she tells stories! I think you guys have a similar vibe in art style.""]",6/7/2021 9:44,https://forums.tapas.io/t/constructive-criticism-for-webtoon/59984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","['I took a look at your first three episodes and I would have guessed that based on the title and the style that this would be in the Comedy/Romance genre. I can also see how Slice of Life could work but I would really reconsider Fantasy as a genre. You can also try the ""Heartwarming"" genre since it seems like a very lighthearted comic, and it\'s a much smaller pool of comics that you\'d be competing with.\nI think the reason you might be getting few comments is because the storytelling needs some work. People can\'t comment on things they don\'t understand, and I was kind of confused reading the beginning of this. I didn\'t know why the characters were doing what they were doing, and you introduced so many of them all at once. I also noticed that the pacing seems a lot better in your latest episode, so I\'d consider updating your first few episodes - even if it\'s just to put more space in between the panels. Your art is really clean and expressive, I just think the pacing/storytelling can be improved and you\'ll get a lot more attention.', ""Thanks, I've been playing around with genres a lot lately to see if I'm in the right place.

83,Critique: Adding comic-like elements to a novel,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Heyo! I wanna get some opinions on this idea I just started with my novel.
I love reading. I love writing. It's why I'm writing a novel after all! My other issue is that I love interacting with the people who read and comment on my story. I responded to comments, but I felt like I needed a little something else.
Here's a link to my story. Under Extra Comic, you'll see what I'm talking about. I just want a few outside opinions on if it's a good concept or nah.

I'd consider providing some sort of transcript or something in that regard.\nWhen working with a novel you do not want to lock any new information behind an image, it's just not fair to anyone who might be using a screen reader or something.

Maria used to be severely bullied during her younger days. Now a mob boss, she stands on top of the food chain in the underground world. But she has only one regret...being unable to exact revenge on her step-sister when she had the chance. 

On her...





There are only a few eps out but I'd love to hear some reviews based on what you read. I want to improve my storytelling, as of now I think my problems are pacing and scriptwriting/dialogues. I also plan to revamp the whole series for some reasons.
I would like to take notes of the critics and improve on them.Thank you very much! ","[""Hii, I think it's quite nice!But I think that you should probably add a little more detail for others hair,EG 1.2"", 'I also think you should add a little more on how she takes revenge on others and then later on ML and FL meet cause she did something wrong(just my example)', ""BTW I think that you're quite good with this , keep it up!

I don't know how to express this in words exactly. But I noticed it already in the first episode when the main character passed two girls in the school corridor. Maybe you should add some originality to them? The main character has beautiful eyelashes, why didn't the two in the school corridor have them? do you see what I mean?You definitely need to work on your anatomy. But relax, I need to too xD  Some frames look like they were made in a hurry. It's better not to rush and slowly deliver chapters of good quality. I learned this on myself, the hard way. You still need to work on the backgrounds. I understand that it is 3d in some places. They need to be pimp-up a bit. I had to learn that in a hard way too. I myself was getting a lot of complaints that my backgrounds are weak because you can see that they are 3d. So I searched for a solution and worked on them as much as I could. It can be learned.\nI like the shading, simple. which is the best. The entrance of the main character and showing his face, fact, half covered but well placed position and frame for the eyes. It charmed me. The story itself is very interesting. Your style is original. I like the main character, she's not a typical girl from some anime, which is a big plus because those girls are already annoying xDI hope I helped somehow? If this is your first serious project it's very good. Don't give up. Keep drawing and drawing. With every chapter you will see changes for the better. I already saw the change when I compared the first chapter with the last one. Good job!"", 'Thank you for the feedback!

"", 'I like the premise of your webtoon but I do agree that there are some storytelling elements that could be improved to make it even better!\nSo I only read the first 5 chapters or so relating to the gum incident:\n1) I was pretty confused with what was going on because I think the design of Maria is too similar to one of the other girls- they both have black hair and they\'re both wearing red. Because of that, I started getting confused as to who was who. I think this is an easy fix in the redo, just make that other girl have a different color hair and sweater to make it realllllly obvious. Especially since this is the first time we\'re meeting her, she needs to look really distinct.2) I had to re-read it a couple of times to understand that the girl had put the gum in Maria\'s hair. That panel wasn\'t really clear to me.3) I didn\'t understand why the guy said, ""Having fun bullying girls ten years younger than you?"" when Maria didn\'t seem to do anything that was even that scary. I like her taking out the blade in a threatening way, but I think you really could\'ve exaggerated this moment. The blade switching out was great, but it would\'ve been awesome to have a couple more panels where Maria gets close to the girls with the blade, really making THEM think she\'s going to cut them. And then do the whole sequence with the hair cutting and trash.', 'That makes a lot of sense!

I put it in quotes because...it's not really a critique where I list every thing I didn't like. This is a legibility critique. I will tell you if I understood or didn't understand your comic. I will tell you if I read panels out of order. I will tell you if I read bubbles out of order. I'm here to tell you if I got confused. I will be your random reader with an impartial opinion.
so, for rules:
-I'm only going to look at the more recent stuff in your comic if it is very long, mostly because the older stuff is from years ago and like...if you haven't fixed it by now you're never going to fix it, so let it go--what's done is done--you're a new person now and straight up I never judge artists by comics they made several years back. So it's fine. I'm just looking at more recent stuff where it's more reflective of the artist you are now.-I won't judge your kink-- no porn allowed. Nothing against your kink it's just that what may be confusing to me may be hot to someone else and seriously, I'm not gonna do the bad thing and judge someone elses kink, just no porn please. I won't be reading those things under the mature filter if it's sexual.-tell me what programs you're using to make your comic, because I want to help you, and if it there's something going wrong, it could be a program thing in how you export it or the wrong brush or something like that. I have a lot of experience, so feel free to ask me about that stuff.-is there any parts you want me to focus on? Or maybe something in particular you are struggling with (like colors or perspective or somethign like that)?
And that's it, I'm only opening 3 slots right now and probs won't check in again until later this weekend. 
If you want to see what my art is like, just to know what my own art preferences are like (although I'm pretty open to art preferences, I have no qualms against page format or not or manga or not, so it shouldn't be an issue in this ""critique""), here's my comic.

Turns out I was a little more busy than I thought, so hopefully it wasn\'t making you nervous or anything while waiting for this little...kind of critique? It\'s not really a critique, since it\'s just legibility stuff. \nSince this is scroll format and I\'m on a tiny baby laptop I\'m gonna read it on my phone, hopefully that was the way you intended, since it\'s a bit too tall to be nicely read on this tiny laptop screen.\nOne of the biggest things was onomatopoeia usage--which is the words we use in english to be sound effects. I get the sense that this may not be your first language, and so I don\'t want to get on your case about technical writing and grammar usage (I still understood it quite clearly, even if some of the grammar was a little off). However, with onomatopoeia, interpretation can go different directions, so I\'ll let you know how I interpreted them.\n-In Ep 1 I think I read everything the right way and in the right order. It came off funny to me, so hopefully that was what you were going for, especially since this big egg in the sky is honking like a duck in the first panel there when it says ""HONK HONK"". \nI will say the art is very clean and nice, and I would like to see more of it, there\'s a bit of copy paste going on which I don\'t think is wrong, but I think some panels just needed more redrawing on top of what was drawn in the scene before it to make more reaction and interaction in the characters themselves. It is episode one, so don\'t worry about it, don\'t redraw everything or anything like that, just know that I got less of an emotional punch than what could have been.\n-In Ep 2 the crickets make the sound of ""Cricket."" This could be a humor thing, in which case, I like this joke, keep it in. but it could also be that you wanted the actual sound a cricket makes, which is a chirp. Crickets chirp. Confusing since you don\'t want to be interpreted as birds, but you can add more iiiii\'s to the chiiiirp chiiiiirp or you can always just say cricket because again, I think that\'s pretty good, although it is kind of incorrect.\n-I like that you chose a big landscape shot for when it says ""why is it still up there"" in episode 2. This brought a nice moment of mystery and helped build that tension I think you\'re looking for. It\'s a bit ominous.\n-There seems to be a period of time between when he says ""Yeah I still have the book, do you need it?"" and when he wakes up in a void--I\'m not sure if he fell asleep or if he sort of passed out while on the phone. Maybe you want to keep that a secret right now in the way you\'re telling the story, which is fine, but just know that for me as  a reader, it wasn\'t clear if he meant to fall asleep or not.\n-After he gets a visit from his ancestor who says ""child"" he moves his head with a motion that says ""SET"" and I don\'t know what you meant to say here. Set doesn\'t really infer turning your head. Did you mean turn? (and I did get that he was turning just from the one white line, so it isn\'t necessary to say ""turn"" although you can.)\n-I do get the vibe that he is angry and confused at meeting his ancestor, so that\'s good. Also, I liked the contrast between him being late and in a hurry to get to school, and then realizing that there was no reason to be worried because all humans are gone. Makes nice tension.\n-On Ep 4, there\'s a scene where the small crying boy dissappears in a WHOOSH and at first I thought the background here was a decorative pattern--I didn\'t realize it was meant to be the ground. Perhaps if you included the thing he was hiding behind in this scene, it would cement the fact that this is a physical background and not a decorative one.\n-The panel ""I am just looking around if there is someone else other than me"" is a bit of an awkward sentence, some rewording to make it more clean or clear would be better. There\'s a lot of ways to say this sentence and I don\'t want to tell you to just use mine, but saying something like ""I am just looking around to see if there is anyone else other than me left."" Is less confusing of a sentence.\n-On Ep 5 I read the first panel as ""Ye-Yeah"" before ""It\'s nice that you have a car, Vikal."" This could be because I\'m hard coded to read left to right, that and it\'s the first panel so it\'s hard to come from the right direction instead of the left.\n-In Ep 6 when Vikal gets his stuff while still not leaving the bathroom, I was confused, but then I noticed Farrel is also confused--so that\'s good. I think you meant for it to be a mystery there.\n-I like that we have a character interaction with Vikal cooking Farrel pancakes, it helps me like them more, and it shows that they\'re bonding.\n-In Ch 8 the dark blue background with black text on it is still legible because of that white outline, but it\'s cutting it pretty close.\n-In Ep 10, she says the words ""HAA HAA"" as a reaction to everyone disappearing, and when I see ""Haa haa"" I think of sarcastic laughter, but I don\'t think she\'s laughing. Is this heavy panicked breathing? I\'m not sure what emotion you meant.\n-In Ep 12 we see the word ""Set"" again as an onomatopoeia and I still don\'t know what this means.\n-I like the introduction of Irina, especially when it meets up with our protagonist and we find out he has like a heebie jeebie sort of magic we were not aware of. It is a nice reveal.\nOverall, there were some grammar problems, but I could still understand everything (that and like...a grammar critique is a whole other critique and I don\'t want to dog you for every time you misspelled something or used the wrong tense.) And I like it, you build something new nearly every episode, you\'re getting better at the art the more episodes we go, and you have an interesting world an premise. Good luck on the rest!', 'Thank you so much!!! This is very thorough! Thanks for taking the time! And as you guessed English is not my first language. I’ve been thinking to find a beta-reader and I think this is it! Thank you again!!', 'oh yeah i forgot to say which program i use; clip studio paint for pc.', ""Thank you! I didn't end up getting to it last weekend (had things pop up) but should get to it this evening I think."", 'All right! Onto Code: Youkai.\nSo this one is longer, I did read the whole thing, but I want to focus this critique on the later more recent stuff since that\'s more where you are at right now as an artist. So to summarize anything that stood out from episodes 1-30, the plot is good and interesting, and I\'ve followed it just fine. The monster stuff is fun, and I liked how we get a slow reveal of who this doctor is piece by piece as the story goes on. So it never really lore dumps, it naturally reveals the world that it lives in, and I like that.\nThere were some places where I mixed up characters when they were introduced, which is partly because hair is my biggest signifier of who anyone is. Their faces and builds are very similar, and their eyes are too small to go by just eye color alone. But I quickly figured out who was who, so that really isn\'t that big of a deal (and a lot of those characters are only there for a little while anyway, I always knew who the main characters were because they\'re more distinctive). I also had a hard time reading some of the scenes that occurred in the dark. I think this is something you already know about because you mentioned it in the author notes--I had my phone on 100% brightness and I couldn\'t make every panel out.\nSo there\'s a ton of ways to remedy this (including just having more light sources in night scenes) but I have this problem myself. And what I like to do is look at a histogram of the scene with Levels or with Curves (Levels is easier than curves). You probably already know about this, but for anyone reading about this that may not know what this is, I\'ll just explain it for their sake. \nSo here\'s a little Levels tutorial for anyone interested: In Clip Studio it\'s called ""Level correction"" and in Photoshop it\'s also called ""Levels"" and you can find it in the menu. A histogram tonal graph tells you the amount of dark colors you have vs light colors in graph form--Usually, we have a mountain kinda like this\n\nthis is an example just off of Google, of what a more typical histogram graph looks like. Left is dark stuff, the right is light stuff, all the stuff in between are mid-tones. Where the peak of that mountain is, is where we have the most colors of that range. You can see ""ah, this is a kinda dark scene, the peak of the mountain is at the left."" While it depends on the piece, I\'ve always found it helps to aim my art so that I have a natural looking mountain like this one that is wide enough to have a range of midtones in it.\nIf I do a histogram on this scene using Clip Studio:\n\n\nYou can see that we do not have much of a mountain--it\'s pretty much up against the left side there. A quick fix is to take that arrow on the right and pull it towards your mountain, this will brighten everything within that range without having to redraw or recolor. Basically it takes your lightest color and moves it towards pure white.\n\nhist2.jpg1073x594 323 KB\n\nIt\'s a really nice tool to help us see all the lovely details that get lost in the dark.\nMoving on, I think you mentioned you thought your ambient light was distracting, and I didn\'t feel it was. I actually appreciated when the light helped it jump from the darker backgrounds. There were several places it looked just lovely.\nthe other thing, and this is more of what I found distracting--since you wanted me to look out for that--is you use a lot of stage direction-type words in your comic, and especially in those fight scenes (like it\'s not onomatapiea but just words like ""stop, escape, punch"". A lot of comics do it, so it\'s not wrong, but it does change the tone. This is a dark horror adventure vampire story, and the stage directions make it feel more cartoony. It\'s up to you, but occasionally it felt like it was also there to clarify moves that may be harder to draw.\nNow for Episodes 30-on:\n-On Ch 8.2 when it says ""Either way, I attacked him first and he just defended \'imself"" I at first thought that Maeko was saying that. I did figure out from the way he said \'imself that it was her bodyguard/bro, but just the fact no one else was in that panel or the one before it is why I initially thought that.\n-In ch 8.3 There\'s a whistling panel that is a little confusing--there\'s a patch on his nose there that breaks that face silhouette and so at first I didn\'t know what was happening in that panel, if it were not for the ""whistle"" sound effect after it.\n-In ch 10.1 she says ""there had to be a fence there!"" I can\'t actually very well see the fence on my phone because it\'s too dark.\n-In Ch 10.2 the panel where she says ""I\'d better get going before he calls my-"" I can\'t see the limbs behind here because it\'s too dark. If it weren\'t for one in front of her face, I\'d just assume there was nothing there.\n-I also want to add that this last fight arc you\'ve done is soo much improved in quality, and I like seeing that improvement. It was a fun fight.\nSo that\'s it, overall, it\'s easy to understand, real legible--a good time!', ""Wow, thanks a lot! I guess I never really noticed if my characters' eyes were too small, though I'm glad you were able to distinguish who was who. I'll be taking into consideration the direction words in the near future. As you stated, a bunch of comics use them, so I wanted to use them to help make my story clearer. I'm glad that you think the plot and story is interesting and that it was easy to read. Again, thank you so much!"", 'yaya, and it\'s not that they\'re ""too"" small--just that on the phone they look very similar to eachother, so if I was using that as a way to tell people apart, it doesn\'t work as well when the characters are at a distance (close up I can tell just fine). You don\'t have to give everyone googly eyes or anything, haha.', ""OK I finally got to the third on my list, thanks for waiting, I ended up just being more busy than I thought this weekend so I had to get to it till now. Funnily enough I swore I subbed to your comic a while back (left comments even) and I was unsubbed for some reason today as I was reading it? Anyway I resubbed so that'll...fix that problem I guess. (like what happened there?)\nAs far as legibility goes--it's really legible and has a good quality to it, which is one of the reasons I found it easy to get into and one of the reasons I subbed in the first place back in the day. I think your bubbles read well, I never read out of order, and I think your paneling makes sense, and I love the voices you gave to your characters.\n If I was to get nitpicky about composition, there are places where the composition does feel like it's cut and pasted from your page format version, but I like that you put the panels in different sizes and different places to move the eye around. It's harder to move the eye about in vertical comics, since there's just not much left or right that the eye can go. And, I think having that contrast between big panel and small panel helps create interest, makes good sense of timing and space--you seem to already understand that. I especially like when we overlapped longer panels with smaller panels, or broke through the panel gutter, because that helped the composition feel less like it was cut and paste, and more like it was originally scroll format to begin with.\nThere are other comics (like I really enjoy Midnight Furies for this) that go from page format into scroll, and they add details outside the panels to help it feel less like a void--but that's not so necessary, and it does make your file size just so much bigger. I've been doing that and filling the void makes me happy but also makes it impossible to upload haha. I agree with you that it's very grey in some of the pages, but I think it's mostly just that gutter color doing that. I think your scenes in themselves are probably fine enough.\nIt's still a point in the comic where it's just heating up, so we haven't had any need for dynamic scenes to either get confused in (which can happen in a fight scene) or have a need to push further in our panel compositions. So for now--this is good. I really don't have complaints. \nEither way, it's a great comic, was already reading it (and had some catching up, which was nice) good job! \nAlso kudos on using procreate for this--I hear it's wonderful, but does have some limitations in file size and layers, and as someone who has like a billion layers as part of my process, hats off to you for going for it. It seems to work well for your comic."", ""Thank you! That's really helpful, and I'll go check out Midnight Furies.  And yeah, I remember you having left a comment. Could be one of those weird website glitches, I know they happen from time to time.\nThose early episodes where I was cut and pasting panels definitely don't scroll as cleanly, I agree. It'll be fun re-working them, which is something I'm slowly getting through on weekends where I have the time. I'm working purely in a vertical format now, so future episodes shouldn't have that problem! (Or if they do, it's my fault, and not the fault of the process I use.)\nIt's good to hear the bubbles read well. That's something I'm definitely not practised in, so yay, instincts!\nProcreate does have limitations, but once they patch for the newest iPad, I'm hoping those limitations will have the ceilings raised to the extent that I'm not constantly cracking my head against them. It'll be nice to work with even slightly longer files, even working vertically I still need to chop files into small chunks. But I love the app, I love how seamlessly it just fades into the background as I work, and I have a huge amount of custom brushes there. Moving to Clip Studio would be a massive and time-intensive undertaking.""]",5/20/2021 20:40,https://forums.tapas.io/t/anyone-want-a-legibility-critique-for-your-comic-slots-filled/59285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,Should i redraw my first chapters?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello everyone ! Eversince i've started my comic my artstyle keeps evolving, and turns out my first chapters are a bit more odd looking than the last ones. The issue is, i like to see how my art has evolved, but on the other hand i know that it's usually while reading the first chapters that you want to continue the story or not, and sometimes if the art doesn't please you during these early chapters, you don't keep on reading.
So can you please tell me if i should redraw the first chapters or not ?
here's my comic, if you want to compare i drew the prologue not so long ago, and the first chapter 5 months ago

Dana is a 17-year-old high school girl, lives alone with her big brother Yohan. Both of their life is about to change drastically, every character will face their youth and all the mistakes it takes on the way to adulthood. LGBTQ+





","[""Hmm the art in the first few chapters seems fine to me. :o It's not necessarily always a good idea to redraw your old chapters because your art will evolve and you'll want to redraw them again and again... on the other hand, a lot of comic artists do tend to remake their old eps every so often. So up to you."", ""According to Tapas, it's worth redoing the first few chapters if they will be better. Because readers judge you by the first eps, they dont care if you evolve or not in the latest chapters. If first eps are good, they will subscribe"", ""If the comic had been going a couple of years and the difference between the old and new chapters was huge I'd maybe advise it, but in this case the art is just a little bit more polished, while the style remains consistent and characters are recognisable, so for you I wouldn't recommend it. I think you'll get further by just maintaining solid updates for a while to grow the audience."", ""No. Don't do that. Its nice to see progress in comics. People will appreceate it. U can leave like information on the begining of ch1. that your art style evolved and every chapter will be different and better and please to be patient? My season 1 and season 2 is totaly different and through s.1 u can see how my art changed. it is a nice thing to see. so don't do this."", ""I wouldn't recommend it, especially with 16 episodes... If you feel like you want to redraw them now, you probably will again after another 16. So you'll slow down your project for something potentially unsatisfying because you won't even stay happy with your redraws as you continue refining your artwork.\nI made a similar topic last year when I had about 10 episodes done and current me is sooo glad I took the advice I got to just keep going ."", ""I wouldn't redo your first chapters, because we all progress and evolve with time. It's normal. There's not much of a difference between the first episode and the latest one. I can see it's a bit more polished, but the style doesn't jump all over the place. If it was drastic, I'd say to redo it. \nI tweaked my first chapter when I reprinted a couple of years ago. But, I didn't redo all of it. It would be too much work and I progressed so much in 5 years that it would be too noticeable to go that far back. Tweaking, wasn't so noticeable. As long as you evolve gradually, it's not that noticeable from one chapter to another. It's only really noticeable when you look back many years. Generally, readers like to see how an artist grows as the story moves forward. \nSometimes, not all pages are amazing, but if the overall artwork is consistent, you're good. I know some pages of my first chapter are not great, but the first few pages are strong, so I'm good. We all have our good days and our bad days."", ""I've read webcomic a long time ago before tapas and webtoon was even a thing. I have a habit of looking at the first chapter and skipping to the latest page to see how and/or if the art changed. \nSo redoing the first chapter I would not recommend it. Since everytime you do you'll most likely get better at drawing again and you'll be stuck redoing chapter 1 over and over again. no matter if you see mistake or that you've improved just keep moving forward and you'll find yourself with a completed series. At least that's what I think. \nBest of luck!"", ""In my experience, it is ok to remaster and redraw, BUT only if you have the time to. If it is taking time away from your work and interrupting your work schedule, save that as work to do when you get the other stuff done.

92,Requesting some feedback on my upcoming comic’s art style,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So as I've been working on my new comic Tales of Phaeton, I've been trying to shift my style to aim for a style more akin to that of an anime or manga (Thin outlines, more cel shading type art, that sort of thing) in order to push myself as an artist and separate it from my previous works.
Here are some examples below:

Sorrel Thin Line Style Test.png960x1200 860 KB


ToP Tiberius Art.png1200x1500 587 KB

I would like some feedback on if I'm on the right track with the thinner outlines and some general tips on how to get a cleaner line with the thinner lines as well. (Along with some general feedback on the character designs and art style as well in that regard.)
Thanks for the help and feedback. ","['The main issue I\'m seeing is that there could be a bit more confidence to the volumes of the characters. Some of the shadow placement feels a bit odd, or the way lines are placed makes it unclear which parts of the character are in front of, inside of, or behind other parts. The fine lines aren\'t a bad choice, but they don\'t give you a lot of room to hide when you\'re not 100% certain where a fold should fall, or exactly how a piece of clothing or a part of the character is structured. I\'d recommend reading a book called ""Drawn to Life"" by Walt Stanchfield. It\'s full of lecture notes from the classes used to train the young animators behind the Disney Rennaisance in the late 80s from an animation legend. It has great tips on exactly this kind of advanced structural drawing that will help you level up.\nAs for general tips and tricks for smooth lines:\n\nDraw at a higher size and resolution than you plan to publish and just view the canvas at 50% size while drawing. It tends to iron out small wobbles.\nTurn up the line smoothing on your pen or brush tool.\nIf you need a line to be really smooth, you can always use shape/line/curve/pen tool lines\n', 'Ah, thank you for the feedback. I\'ve always had a bit of trouble with fabric and folds of fabric in general. So I\'ll definitely look into that book you recommended as well.\nAlso might possibly see if I can find a ""Happy medium"" between the thin and thick line art as well and see if I can find something interesting that works for me and looks good. Should probably practice more with the pen tool as well for clean lines, too.\nThanks again! ', 'I think the style is cool and unique. I would maybe tone down the colours a little bit, as they are super saturated and bright. I think reading comics like that feels a bit hard for the eyes. Also you can experiment with the thickness of your outlines a bit, it makes characters pop a bit more.', ""Thanks! Yeah, colors have always been something I've struggled with, trying to find less saturated colors that don't make things looked washed out in that regard. I'll play around more with that and the line thickness and see what looks best. "", ""I think the thinner lines look really good with your style  I think especially in a comic context drawings with this line quality will read clearly.\nI agree with the previous comments that maybe looking for a middle point between these and the super thick ones might look even nicer though. \nOverall it's trending in a good direction, I think "", ""Thanks. I think it's trending in a good direction as well. "", ""They look very nice and clean! As others have said, I think having a little more line weight would be helpful in making things really pop. I used to have rather thick lineart; it's been slimming down subtly over the years as I've become more confident with detail, and it's settled at a kind of medium thickness where I can still push variation in line weight without the lines being the main focus of the drawing. I think medium line weight is pretty ideal for toony comics.\nA big challenge is that thinner lines don't mask mistakes the way thicker lines can. That means you'll be wanting to focus on drawing fundamentals a lot more; fabric folds is one. (I'm also terrible at those...) Grab some photos of loose-necked turtlenecks and do some tracing, some eyeballing from reference, and finally some stylisation of the folds to simplify them into your style.\nThe eyes on the fox look really nice, I like how the lower eyelashes are detached. It's a nice style."", ""Thanks! Yeah, I think a medium thickness works best for more stylized comics as well. I should focus more on studying fabric folds as well as I work on my comic given that's something in general I've been wanting to do in general as well.\nAlso thanks! I really like those eyes on Sorrel as well. They're the eyes I usually use for my animal characters, actually. They're simple, and they look nice. "", 'I am a fan of thin line art and cell shading has been something that defeats me constantly.\nHow do you feel about this direction? Did you enjoy creating these drawings?', ""Thanks!\nI'm feeling like I'm on the wright track. Just need to tweak it a bit more I feel until I find something I truly like."", ""That's important. The style must be something you are comfortable with and enjoy otherwise you draw out of a sense of obligation (make it look right) as opposed to enjoyment. The latter of those is sustainable and sustainability is important when drawing comics because of its repetitive nature."", ""That makes sense and having a style I like as opposed to a style I'm only doing to chase trends and be popular is something I've been trying to learn in general in recent times. "", ""So I did some more experimenting with the art style and taking in your guys' feedback and I think I'm definitely starting to get there. \n\nCygnus Art Style test.png640x800 875 KB\n"", 'Keep going.

93,Is My Story Description Good?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey, so I'm wondering if my story description is actually good or not. It's something of a big point of insecurity for me, and I couldn't help but notice that there are plenty of other stories that haven't been around for nearly as long as mine but have way, way better analytics overall.The description, in the interest of not being a scumbag:
""Death set me free, but then it rejected me like a high school crush way out of my league.""
A swordmaster flees from her hometown and to the illustrious city of Halych, leaving behind a history of sorrow and pain to find better people and claim a better future for herself. There's a problem: She won't find it here. Something in Halych is turning people into monsters, amplifying their worst elements and driving them to do terrible things, and the worst part is that it's nothing new to Halych. As June works within a secretive swordsmanship school known as the Haracrein, she will be brought by degrees to fight the corruption in Halych's underbelly, and eventually she'll be forced to make decisions that make her question her deepest convictions.
How much of her humanity will she lose in the process?
This story will contain frequent displays of graphic violence, harsh language, and touches on topics of moral ambiguity and the usage of hard drugs. Viewer discretion is advised.

","['""Death set me free, but then it rejected me like a high school crush way out of my league.""\nI like this quote, but the rest of the summary doesn\'t seem to fit with it\'s modern, YA feel. The quote is voicey, while the summary isn\'t. I suggest to inject the summary with voice to match the quote.\nA swordmaster flees from her hometown and to the illustrious city of Halych, leaving behind a history of sorrow and pain to find better people and claim a better future for herself. \nI suggest unloading this sentence a little, because it is a bit on the long side: June, a swordmaster, flees her past to find a better life in the big city. \nThere\'s a problem: She won\'t find it here. \nI would suggest eliminating it. It takes up text and tells me the forgone conclusion, while the next part actually gives details and lets the make up my own goddamn mind.\nSomething in Halych is turning people into monsters, amplifying their worst elements and driving them to do terrible things, and the worst part is that it\'s nothing new to Halych. \nI would suggest simplifying this thought a bit: As exciting as Halych is at the first glance, it has a dark secret. It turns its citizens into monsters acting out their most terrible desires.\nAs June works within a secretive swordsmanship school known as the Haracrein, she will be brought by degrees to fight the corruption in Halych\'s underbelly, and eventually she\'ll be forced to make decisions that make her question her deepest convictions.\nHow much of her humanity will she lose in the process?\nI suggest staying with the present tense, even if you haven\'t written that part of the book yet. It\'s what the book is about. So, present tense. Plus, you are the writer, so I suggest not asking me about your book, but recast it as stakes instead:\nDriven by the desire to purge the city\'s underbelly, June joins the fight on the side of the secret order of the blade saints.

I'm feeling a little bored, so I've decided I will roast the stories of any volunteers that present themselves to me in the spirit of everyone's most loved chef, Gordon Ramsay. I'm not claiming to be the grandmaster of writing, but I've been around the block a time or two. I will be intentionally giving you a hard time, obviously, but I'll also praise what I think you do well. Some ground rules:

Just because you post here doesn't mean I'm guaranteed to look at your story.
Roasts will typically only cover the first few chapters or however much I feel like reading.
To be clear, I don't expect anything of you in turn.
Those specifically looking for a comical roast should specify so in their posts.
This post is primarily for novels, not comics.
Unless specified, I may or may not take a swing at your story description as well. Decals will only be bullied in comical roasts.

I like these kinds of things.\n\ntapas.io7\n\n\n\nThe Eden Chronicles: Absolute Zero | Tapas\nTaking place in the world of the game One Step From Eden, this story is about a scientist named Irelia and her decent that she takes that ends up with her being Selicy.

Not a great first impression. I'd like to know or at least have better clues as to why people like Stanley are getting hired to begin with.I mean, sure, manpower shortage, but why the manpower shortage? This is the time for some serious headcanon, my man! Speaking of headcanon, I know this next part is a nitpick but wanton testing of potentially super-lethal serums on human subjects? Under normal circumstances I'd think that your main source of candidates would be some sort of death row prisoner deal, not broke college students (unless you're headcanoning this as some sort of cyberpunk dystopia, which is also suspiciously short on ways to find runaway rich kids-more on that later).Come chapter 2 and we've already got a problem, or more like several.\nFirst of all, Irelia's supposed to be the smart one, A SCIENTIST, yet she fails to deduce that it was the serum that gave her frost powers, despite her very apparent lack of frostbite. It's like this woman's never heard of a hypothesis in her life. Second of all, this whole backstory where you try to paint Stanley as some tryhard virtuoso who ran away from his rich parents who never bothered to hire a private investigator and apparently evades every database with a photo ID's recognition, while also trying to set him up as some clownish, laid-back character, seriously? THIS IS SO DUMB IT HURTS! I can handle goofy things, but this is a point where I think we've crossed from goofy fun into lazy and/or bad writing.\nLast but not least, I know this part's probably massively unfair given how little I've seen of your story, but this doesn't really feel that much like a OSFE fanfic. So far it just feels like a semi-typical superhero story with a splash of comedy. The big red flag is that the MC doesn't really interact with a spell system of any kind, which is a big old slap in the face to the source material, even though spells are mentioned explicitly in your text.\nOkay, I admit it. I chuckled a few times. But I quit after chapter 2 because the characters got so dumb my brain bluescreened, and there wasn't much about it that was promising aside from that. Fanfiction should have an easy time doing some worldbuilding for heavy immersion, but the opportunity's basically completely wasted as far as I can see.\nEdit: Upon getting over how stupid that reveal was, I may or may not consider revisiting for a few more chapters.

Prepare for a proper roasting, HERETIC!\nCHAPTER 1:*  Stanley is described as a \'nice dude\' at first, but the more I read of him the more he drifts away from that and towards acting like a petulant (and slightly stupid) asshole. Of course, since you\'re the god of this world of yours, this is factual evidence that he is straying further and further from God every day.*  Apparently high tech research facilities trying to discover the formula for magic superpowers still use fax machines. I wonder what kind of thorough research led you to discover that.* Some goddamned scientist the main character is where she can\'t be asked to remember the name of the HIGHLY EXOTIC SPECIMEN they dragged in just so she could create her big break for the company, something which is clearly important to her.* The fight scene had no sense of distance whatsoever. You mean to tell me two of them were close enough for her to slap both of them without having to dart between them? Does she have another superpower we aren\'t being told of?\nCHAPTER 2:* Stanley further irons out his dumbass credentials by refusing to understand she has ice powers. He didn\'t stagger up from the chair like he was surprised at all when she stomped, so that tells me she already showed him beforehand and he whines about still not being able to understand. Whether this(and bothering to flip through the comic to narrate to her what he already said) is a sign of being a petulant asshole or straight up dumbassery or both, I can\'t tell.* I know this might be part of the fun, but Stanley\'s insistence on her becoming a superhero only builds on my headcanon that he\'s just an emotionally manipulative, egotistical asshole with a subtle sense of unearned moral superiority.* Some scientist our protagonist is, that she needs help from Stanley of all people to figure out how exactly she got ice powers. Maybe the experimental serum you made yourself had something to do with it, woman! * Maybe I missed the memo, but why is the scrapyard empty in winter? I don\'t think that\'s supposed to be standard protocol... Actually, are you telling me they also leave the unattended scrapyard\'s shed unlocked so some random scientist can use their blowtorch to weld ice skates to her rubber-soled shoes?* Now, realistically Stanley being frozen solid would kill him via suffocation or hypothermia, and honestly I wouldn\'t have minded if he did actually die then. It would add some emotional weight to the whole thing. I liked the part where she said ""You saw nothing"" to the bystanders though, that got a laugh out of me.\nCHAPTER 3:\n\nNot sure how kicking off skates would have enough force to impale a wood dresser, but okay.\nShockingly enough, this episode isn\'t as much of a disaster aside from that. But I can tell you\'re trying to hint at a possible future romance that I have very, very bad impressions about.\n\nThe interlude was also nice. But now for the GRAND FINALE: I\'M BETTER AT THIS THAN YOU AND I\'M GOING TO PROVE IT!\nBack in chapter 2, we get the basics of Stanley\'s backstory: His rich-ass parents wanted him to be a lawyer/doctor/businessman/etc and were controlling about it. So Stanley went rebellious on them and ran away once he finished high school, making a big show about how he would only be known for his own merits and not his family name. Now, let\'s set aside the obvious problems of the required fake ID, SSN(or in-universe equivalent) and possibly plastic surgery depending on tech level he\'d need to resist even the most baseline-level efforts his parents could\'ve made to find him and focus on that particular stated reason why he ran away.\nThis pains me, because this backstory would infer that Stanley\'s some sort of self-reliant determinator tryhard that is the exact opposite of a slacker(And he\'s definitely a slacker). That initial interpretation would\'ve actually made five times more sense if applied to Irelia. Think about it, we know she\'s hellbent on glory already and doesn\'t really care that much about the true art or doing things the particularly hard way, and her leaving would have already established her as self-centered (which she definitely is), so it would make perfect sense. The backstory\'s good, you just applied it to the wrong character.\nI also found it awkward, while we\'re in the ballpark, about how you tried to paint Stanley as this sort of mentor archetype almost unwittingly, despite them being the same age. I just feel like some of this story would\'ve made more sense if Stanley was just a fair bit older than Irelia in a rewrite, but that\'s just me.\nTry seriously taking a step back to think when you write, maybe that\'ll buff out some of the massive volumes of scuffing that this story has.\nFor those of you still in doubt about Stanley\'s moral character, let me take a quote out of context:""Stanley, you goddamn hussy! Get the hell off of me!""""Not until you agree to give me a chance, Ire!""', 'The latest story \'That Unwelcome Bard\' is preferred.\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nProbably Not Canon | Tapas\nTake 1 Part CUTE 2 Parts STRANGE Mix Vigorously And..

I’m just going to jot down some notes as I read through.\nCh1:\n\nThe first paragraph (at the beginning)  may need one of the longer sentences broken down into two shorter ones. They aren’t confusing to read, but (since it’s the first paragraph) at a first glance it looks intimidating. That being said, if it weren’t the introductory paragraph, it would be gucci.\nThe ellipsis here is redundant:“True, true but this is hardly a task requiring such social rigidity. A favor for a Society contact and possible Author recruitment…” Gears paused and looked out at the approaching town. “Then again, ill-ease seems to be the natural state for this area.”There are a few options for editing it and I’m not super sure which one to recommend since this is more or less a nitpick.\nI like their banter and the way the setting is introduced.\nI read a lot of fiction set in the 1800’s as a kid, so the way they talk and the narration is familiar enough to me. I can’t really comment on what it’s like for a more “green” reader.\nThe captain smoking reminds me of that meme of a fish with a cigarette in its mouth.\n\nCh2:\n\nThis is a personal opinion but I don’t think decay and stagnation are similar. Decomposition is a pretty dramatic process. I do have an uncommon reverence for decay though.\nI either don’t remember, or this is a function of the glamor engines, but does Graves have an accent? Is he from Switzerland?\nI forgot about Gears’ dad! He doesn’t come up much in Rat’s teeth.In the paragraph where Armitage is locking up the door there’s a typo: doubled should be doubted.\nThe ellipsis in Armitage’s speech are a little excessive. I’m not a fan of ellipsis, so take that with a spoon of salt. it might be because I struggle to understand when to use them vs expanding on what is causing the dialogue pause (describing nervous ticks/environmental interruptions).\nThe scene where they turn off their glamor engines happens at a great time pacing-wise!If I was Armitage I would not be able to sleep after thatThe ending of this chapter is also a great incentive to go into the next one.\n\nCh3:\n\nThe pace continues at a satisfying speed with the newspaper insight.\nArmitage being defensive shows he definitely has given thought to his friend being the murderer, which is inline with his character’s intelligence.\n\nGeneral thoughts:\n\nThe city of Arkham reminds me of an anxiety disorder/agoraphobia. It’s described like it’s an organism rather than a collection of organisms. It’s a stronger mental image because of it.\nI tried to recommend your stuff to a friend of mine and trying to sum it up aloud made me sound insane lol. You manage to meld a lot of different things together in a unique way so it’s hard for me to describe it in a summary. I mean this as a compliment! It’s hard to stump my brain like that.\n\nYour stuff is usually polished, so it's hard to give feedback without being nitpicky "", ""Hello! I read the prologue and first chapter! Here are my initial notes and then some general thoughts at the bottom:\n\nWhenever I see a prologue my first thought is “oh no.” I usually skip them when reading (a lot of readers do this), and a lot of the time that means skipping the hook. If you really like the prologue and want to keep it, make sure you maintain an equally solid hook on ch1.\nThe prologue is obtuse and carries very little meaning to the reader because it lacks context to the story. It’s trying to initiate that intrigue, but it reads as more of a teaser. It doesn’t provide any information that is essential to know before reading that couldn’t otherwise be provided naturally within chapter one.\n\nA good example of when to use a prologue would be in Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein or the content-warning-esk prologue in Lolita.\nCh 1:\nI think you should move this sentence to be your hook as the first line:“The air is cold; I can tell by the frost that litters the ground.”And follow it with describing that she is in a tree.\nThat’ll give you a stronger hook line and get the reader interested in two points:Why is she in a tree?Why can’t she feel the cold?\n\nSince fantasy is the main (?) genre, and she was in a tree, the initial use of the word flight made me think she was actually flying.\nThe line about “creatures attempting to avoid their demise” made me think they were somehow trapped in this location for some reason. I’m not sure what is it but the description of how animals interact with her feels a little weird. I’d recommend looking into people’s experiences with accidentally running into bears in the woods. When a bear is nearby the woods will go quiet and still. It’s super eerie and closer to what I think you’re going for while she’s in the tree. A bobcat would be better for the hunting part.\n“My eyes look towards the creatures” is a confusing paragraph because I’m not given much description as to where or what these creatures are. All the reader knows is that she jumped down from a tree and is standing on the ground in a forest.\n“They are rare to eat because they have venom injected into their tusks.” means that an outside force is putting venom into their tusks, which I don’t think is what you meant. Also, I wouldn’t consider being gored by a boar a sting unless it’s a reaaaaaally small boar. Maybe stab or graze?\nHow far away is she from this pig? What is between her and it that it can’t see her?\nMinutes is a long time when talking about holding onto a thrashing boar. You could probably swap it out for seconds, especially since its thrashing will make the venom spread faster.\nI like that drinking blood gives her a high afterward!\nThis is a personal preference, but whenever the setting changes enough to use a dash page break I always feel like it would be better to make it a new chapter. It creates a weird pause in the flow of reading for me.\n“My breath comes out in withdrawn breaths” is repetitive.\nOh! A Jekyll and Hyde situation? If that’s the case ignore my comment about the dashed page break.\nI don’t know if I understand how dry air can taste bitter?\nWrinkles “littering” a face is a strange way to phrase it.\nIf they are peasants they’re probably the ones making the mush right? She should probably know what it’s made from (potato/grits/vegetable peelings from bins/etc). This detail seems small, but it'd be good for world-building and immersion to know what their food is and by extension where it's coming from within their environment.\nI don’t know what a “wash hole” is or why it is “persisting”. What is causing it to persist?\nI like her mom! I’m worried about how she’s getting this money.\n\nGeneral thoughts:A lot of the sensory descriptions feel out of tune with how those sensations are normally described/perceived (in my experience). I would compare it to being almost synesthesia-inducing.\nThe concept is definitely interesting, so don't worry about that! I like the rags to riches premise on top of the medieval vampire (undead?) theme you have going on! \nI’m more interested in what the mc is rather than who she is if that makes sense?\nSince your MC doesn’t talk in the first part of the chapter it’s a great opportunity to use environmental storytelling to convey the setting and backstory to the reader. Are the boar numbers dwindling because of her frequent hunting? Are there fewer animals around in general because they have come to recognize this as her hunting grounds? Is she new to this area and enjoying a larger population of animals to choose from? Is the kingdom rich/poor? Is there a paved/dirt road leading to the gate? Is the wall mossy and old or new and clean? Stuff like that."", 'You have no idea how much this helps me. It is so important for me to hear it from a constructive point of view, you have no idea. Thank you so much for taking the time out and reading it.', ""I'm glad! Let me know if anything I said is confusing or if you need me to find examples of anything for you"", ""Haha thank you, and no those all make perfect sense. Since you won't read further, I will spoil that her mom doesn't actually pay for the dress, it was the king. "", ""Since I’ll be jumping into the story some of the concerns I have might be fixed by the context. Here are my notes from part 2 ch 1:\n\nOh, art! Them looks like they are up to no good.\n“Unlucky waif” relatable \nAh! I love how snarky the first paragraph is! I genuinely laughed pretty hard!\n“His most recent misfortune was being recruited by the Asterial Elves to go die in the Crater of Resentment.” Is a wonderful sentence. The clash of “go die” with the rest of the diction makes it.\nI’m confused on how getting banished works. I’m not sure if everyone gets banished when they turn 16, or if that's just him/his race? If it’s just him why does he know that? Why were his parents banished?\nIf his adopted parents don't like him why did they adopt him? Do they get money from the government for taking him on? Do they gain favor in the community? Is he like a stray cat to them? What's their goal here? \nIf he isn’t forced to leave was he forced to stay? Why didn’t his parents take him with them?\nYour writing voice is very nice and warm! It’s like I’m listening to a wizard telling me a story.\nThe focus is very “zoomed out”. What I mean is that the story is told from a detached omniscient point of view. Instead of getting immersed into the mc’s experiences, the reader is the camera watching the mc. Third-person omniscient! That's the word. It's done very well!\nWhy is he in a carriage now? I don’t know who Eory is so I’m assuming this has to do with an earlier part!\n\nGeneral Thoughts:\n\nThe overall tone is warm/friendly, humorous, and high fantasy eloquent. Your writing voice is really enjoyable and it was a fun read!\nI’m reminded of an old text adventure game for some reason. I can’t remember which one exactly, maybe Zork?\nThis chapter does say “waif” quite a bit, but I’m not put off by the repetition at all. It’s a fun word. It does also sound like it might be the name of a race/culture in context?\n"", ""I'm so glad you caught the humor in there. XD I'm always afraid my stories are too depressing, haha. Good to hear a compliment centered around humor. <3\nAs for getting banished, we learn more about it later, but it happens to waifs when they break a religious or cultural rule. The reason why his parents adopted him is because it's another cultural expectation amongst waifs to take on the child of banished parents. As for why his adoptive parents didn't really like him... well, I'll probably delve more into it later, but this type of thing happens in the real world all the time. A lot of the time, parents who already have biological children will adopt a child, and I don't know what it is, but generally, the parents will not treat that child as well as they treat their biological children, even if they originally intended to. There's a lot of interesting statistics on adopted/fostered children. \nAnd yeah, the carriage part is part of an earlier part. XD I'm also happy you enjoy the third person omniscient POV. I'm always a little worried that people will be put off by it. \nThank you for the thorough critique on this random chapter! I'll be sure to go through and make it clearer that not all waifs are banished, and to reduce the amount of times I sat waif, hehe."", 'Hah! Same, I always accidentally end up writing sad stuff. In the novella I just finished writing the main characters are all foster kids!', ""Hello!Since it is fairly short so far, I read everything you have posted. Is your first language something other than English? Knowing this will help me get a better idea of where your writing is coming from.\nThe explosion:\n\n“She just wanted to get over with every single work she had, to go back.” I’m not sure what exactly this means. Maybe try rephrasing it?\nThis is a solid opening! It's a good hook to keep the reader invested into the next chapter.\n\nA Falling Stranger and Waking Up:\n\nThe dialogue is a little stiff. They’re speaking a bit formally for having grown up together. This also might be a language/culture difference though?\nKeep an eye on your tenses. It sometimes shifts from past tense to present tense. Ex: “They were getting sick of this tiny town that they knew every single detail about.” Is past tense. “So do the other younger people.” Is present tense.\nI like Rehan and Majeer’s interaction overall, it feels natural.\nWhat kind of birds croak? Croak is usually a frog sound.\nSome of the word choices are a little off. I can usually understand what’s being said, but try to keep an eye on the conjugations.Ex: “Felisa felt scared for the girl, and useless for can’t doing anything to help.” The word “can’t” should be replaced with “not”.\nI like the concept of this power they have! I’m not sure if it’s different per person or if everyone's powers share the same basic elements.\nI love how Eda expresses her fascination with the night sky. It’s very cute.\nShe was unconscious for 9 days?! She should be so hungry!\n“...unlimited power and solid strength of motherhood.” Is a fun sentence\nI like how Rehan observes how out of place Eda looks and that Eda is terrible at drawing. Their personalities are getting more distinct the further I read.\nThe last chapter where they are both having one sided conversations is a fun scene.\n\nGeneral Thoughts:\n\nOverall I think the premise and characters are interesting! \nI can tell you know exactly what you want to write, but sometimes the English is a little wonky. I think it’s mostly the conjugations. In my opinion, that's the most difficult aspect of any language. English is especially difficult since it’s three languages in a trench coat.\nYou have a promising writing voice!

Want us to review your story in our web magazine? (Calliope) Promotions


    Hi there! Wasn't sure if I should put this under Intro/feedback/shoutout or Misc. Me and three other authors are working on a magazine called Calliope. Next week is the Monthly special featuring collab art and such.  We would like to do a bit where we do reviews of other people's works. 

So, do you want us to take a look at and review your work? A couple of things of note: - Depending on the amount of reactions, we might not be able to review all stories, so we might have to pick and choose. - …

107,What makes certain new comic titles popular?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"It may sound like ranting. But let's brainstorm.I guess we know the basics: thumbnail, cover art, your art style, and lastly the plot/story + promotions/maybe the author is already popular.

Not everything is in the one place or country.\nThere is no hard science on how to become popular.

Avoid generic sounding titles like ""His Eyes"" or ""Angel\'s Wings"".\nCover illo looks interesting and polished, has some element that engages the viewer like great art, eyecatching colours or intriguing expressions.\nCover has a readable title with decent design choices on the font and style.\nSeries blurb clearly outlines what the story is about and makes the premise sound interesting. It\'s written in clear English.\nThe series is in a pleasing style. Colour comics are generally more eyecatching, but black and white can do well if it\'s got good contrast and the B/W looks like a confident stylistic choice rather than looking unfinished.\nThe story establishes the tone and premise quickly. Popular comics on Tapas may even hit the act 1 catalyst within the first update, skipping the setup to add it in later through flashbacks or narration.\nComics that hit a lot of popular tropes like ""tall and smol"" ""enemies to lovers"" ""isekai"" have an advantage.\nComics in certain categories have a bigger average readership  (Romance, Fantasy, BL) But ones in smaller categories (Action, Mystery) are easier to find in their category.\nIf the creator has fans from previous works, that will give a boost. More readers of previous works will read the new one if it\'s in a similar style and genre.\nThe comic updates regularly. Small regular updates are better for growth than occasional big ones.\nWhatever time you update, do it when at least some Americans are awake. 10AM GMT is the WORST time I\'ve found.\n\nAnd of course...\nGetting a staff pick or similar makes a big difference!

109,New Novel Description? HALP o_O,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi, uhh, a few people have told me that my description is a bit short and vague, but I also don't want to give away too many details, you know? And I want to limit it so that people can see it before they click to read. Soo, I'm wondering if I should change it, because I also feel like it doesn't really match right now ;-; I suck at summarizing anything not related to objectivity. I blame my English classes.

Think this is a normal love story? Think again.
It's 2016 and our MC has found her person. She knows that he's got to be her Prince Charming. She would do anything for him...ANYTHING. Is this infatuation or a toxic obsession? Only time will...





","[""Think of the description in terms of having to answer the who, what, where, why, when, how questions. You don't need to cover all of them, because some will be integral to your stories plot and some answers can be clearer then others, but you need to give some basic information about your plot or else it'll look like a bare bones version of any novel ever.\nAlthough my description for my novel is in no way perfect, I'll use it as an example. \nWho: Simon and his ex-best friend Joey Where: unclear, but the cover shows a snowy landscape and a hotel is mentioned When: during their schooltrip What: Simon tries to reconnect with his ex-friend Joey, but that'll be difficultWhy: because Simon has a crush on him, but Joey dislikes him for some reason How: this will be covered in the story"", 'It is a bit vague ""Our MC has found her person."" especially. This doesn\'t give me an emotional hook to care about it, it sounds more like a description of a concept of a story rather than a description of a story.\nObjectively from a quick browse of the novel, this seems to be:\nA teenage girl who has an unhealthy obsession with a boy in her school writes a journal chronicling all the things she wants to say to him over the course of a few years.\nHonestly I was reading it like ""...is this really a romance? I hope the guy she\'s obsessed with isn\'t the love interest if it is, or she goes through considerable character growth and only gets together with him after she learns to stop obsessing over him because this feels really weird right now, she\'s writing a whole diary addressed to her crush. This girl needs emotional support."" So maybe the other part of the blurb needs to suggest that the story is about her shifting viewpoint over time, like:\nAs her viewpoint changes with time and distance, can she find the love she needs?', 'ooh, thank you this is very helpful', 'ahhh, thank you thank you, do you mind if i use some of this?', 'No problem at all, feel free to!', 'Hmmm I like the contrasts you find here- like how you make it different from your typical love story...\nI think to know truly where to go with the intro I’d have to know the theme?? Like is it a lite story that progresses into a horror or a kinda of the reverse. This is all my personal opinion but I also wouldn’t say ‘MC’ Rather just maybe a first name or both first and last name- the rest seems pretty good to me for ensiting interest tho!', 'Ooh, okay so the MC thing~\nI was actually going to reveal who she is later on, as like an added ""spice"" to the plot, if you know what I mean. I mean, it may or may not progress into a darker version, I\'m not completely sure what I want it to be, though so ', 'If her identity is a twist somehow in The story that’s fine! Although in that case if you need to keep her identity a secret whatever you use to describe her (this me assuming that this may be written in third person) or however the MC refers to herself (in first person) then use that, like ‘I’m girl X and I’m in love’ For first person or ‘this is the MC, she’s in love’ for third person for example. It doesn’t matter what the ‘narrator’ calls her so long as long as you’re consistent! Up until the twist that is- And then name drop. \nAs for not knowing where you’re going that’s fine too! ^^’ for picking your genre and writing your intro it’s helpful to know what major themes you’ll be dealing with but it’s not a necessity and whatever you end up doing, you can always just change the info part ']",5/2/2021 4:00,https://forums.tapas.io/t/new-novel-description-halp-o-o/58338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,[CLOSED] Could Someone Help Me With My Novel’s Description?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi! Could someone please give me some feedback with my novel's description? I've changed the original description and it turned into this:

Ari who was the only child of her nouveau riche parents lived a young life. Still, she was ready to face whatever sentence she would receive in the afterlife- be it to live in Heaven or drop down straight to Hell. All was well until her soul was forcefully pulled from Earth and placed into a newborn’s body by her imaginary childhood friend, Mariana.
Mariana, now revered to as the Creator of All, came to life after Ari died. Due to her obsession with her “creator,” she went against God’s will and created Imaginan. She then dragged Ari’s soul to Imaginan. She thought that the latter would love to live in the world she used to imagine as a child that turned into a source material for her novels.
In her new life, Ari is now regarded as the Hope of the Kingdom who broke the century-long curse that was cast upon the country’s nobility. She now lives as the only Princess of her kingdom and was love by her family, especially the King. Despite all this, she finds it hard to prove herself to everyone because the magic she inherited is a Peculiar type, a magic seen as useless.
Now named Iris, follow her as she struggles to accept her reality, pushing some of her Earthly-ideals to the people of Amari, the country she is reborn in.

I'm not really good in writing ""hook-y"" description but I try my best. However, there are people who tell me that the description doesn't hook them the way the prologue does.

When spoiled rich girl Ari's life ends, she finds herself reborn as Princess Iris in a fantasy world created by her childhood imaginary friend! But being a princess comes with being the last hope to remove an evil curse from the royal bloodline,...





","[""Not a feedback, just a commentary. Please excuse me.\nThis is your preview:\nScreenshot_2021-05-02-14-02-50-055_com.android.chrome.png1080x647 181 KB\n\nIf you want to hook readers, especially when you promote here, better make the interesting and crucial parts show in the preview. I suggest it by shortening and condensing your description.\nSo the summary is (correct me if I am wrong).\n\nAri was reborn to a new world her imaginary friend Mariana (almost typed Marinara, sorry) created based on her WIP novel, because Mariana thinks Ari would love it.\nIn that world she —now Iris— was living a pleasant live as a princess, loved by especially the king.\nHowever she felt emptiness and the need to proof herself because she owns a useless magic type.\nNow, she felt the need to instill her home world ideology to the people of her new world.\n\nIMO, the most interesting and notable part is the fact that it is Ari is dragged by someone made by her into a world that made by her, and she has still to adjust herself in that world. I think the description can be really condensed into that one sentence. That should be what you put in it as a focus. \nIt would be even better if cut down some lengthier stuffs like Ari's past life, or Imaginan  stuff (it is not even explained where and what is that) and the mechanism between WTF Mariana is doing. I think that can be saved for actual story. Not to mention too many names and terms in the blurb can confuse readers.\nAlso what is the relevance between Mariana becoming godlike thing, with the struggle of Ari/Iris fitting in which is framed as if it is the main conflict? It is like the two things hardly match when described like what you described.\n Is it like the Mariana stuffs is the grand thing of the plot, while the fitting in thing is just the secondary one? I do think that the concept of imaginary friend reincarnating you is quite interesting.\n"", ""Thanks! I like your opinion and would try condensing the whole description into one, solid paragraph/sentence.

Chapter 40: Forgiveness
I stayed in my room for the whole month, neither letting anybody inside nor talking to everyone. I ate less and less and dazed more and more as days went by. My appetite diminished to the point that I hurled whenever I looked at my food. If I stared at it for more than a minute and I would start...





","['\'never letting anybody inside nor talking to everyone\'- This is just a nitpick, you don\'t need to heed this but: As a reader, I kept wanting to change that ""Never"" into ""NEITHER"" because the word ""neither"" partnered with ""nor"" feels more natural. \n\' I ate less and less and dazed more and more as days went by\'- The MC\'s thinking this in a narrator\'s tone of voice, but it would be stronger if a \'picture\' was painted that showed it. Rough Example: My appetite diminished to the point that I played with my food instead of consuming any of it, as if I were stuck in a perpetual daze of numbness.\nThe rest of the intro paragraph was plenty strong, but I suggest breaking up the first sentence like so (words in paragraphs are just rough suggestions):\nI felt like an uglier version of Robin Scherbatsky when she was wasted after she broke up with Don on episode 1 of season 6 of HIMYM. But instead of (Cheetos) on my hair, it (was covered with dried up saliva and tears. (I disgusted myself) and I didn’t have a Barney Stinston to light the fire in me to sundressed up. \nA push, that’s all I needed and I swore I’d change but I (had) pushed (away) the people who’d push me out of my shit [I love just about everything about that first sentence].  I (finally) realized how miserable I was and how much damage I did not only to myself but to others as well.\n[I think I\'ll just do the rest the same way, showing alternate suggestions:]\nTears started to flow down behind my ears(, tickling me,) as I silently cried. Countless tiks and toks were produced by the big grandfather clock as the sun slowly yet steadily hid away from everyone[I like this sentence, too]. Night soon came and I still laid there without moving an inch.\n(In a sudden moment,) I sprang up and ran out of the door[the MC\'s sudden actions are fine, but as readers, we need to know what is going through this person\'s head!]. (Enough was enough. I was done with pushing others away.) (Though) my tacky uncombed locks stood up straight and my dingy dress (gave) out a rancid smell, I ran towards the side quarters of my residence. (My)puffs of air and (the clanging) of my shoes made the people I passed by look in my direction. \n“Saridayang!” I heard them (call after me). [Since this is them calling out, it should be a new sentence all by itself]\n“ASH!” I shouted at the top of my lungs when I saw the person I wanted to see the most downstairs. I raced down the (steps faster than I\'d ever descended before). [The word \'stairs\' twice was repetitive]\nEveryone froze on the spot as they heard my hoarse voice. Their dilated eyes follow(ed) my small frame as I haggardly approached them. I stared long and hard at his eyes, my lips wobbled and my body shook as I tried stopping myself from crying. (However, I found that I couldn\'t.) It only took me a (good) few seconds to whimper and reach for his embrace. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry… huhuhu…” I (wept), bubbles of saliva escap(ing) my lips. I clutched the collar of his clothes.\n“It’s okay…” (H)e comforted, (wiping) the snot dripping down my nose with his bare hands. “Shkrishi…”\n“I’m… I’m sorry… I… I was.... Huhuhu….”\n(The two of us somehow made it) upstairs to another room, (where he) settled me down in(to) a chair. He opened the curtains and the door to the veranda to let the air in. Still sniffling, I asked for forgiveness once again but he just smiled softly back at me.\n“It’s part of life, saridayang,"" (he explained.) ""It may be unpleasant and sometimes tortuous but we will experience it one way or another throughout our lives. What’s important is that we take it in and we learn from it.” [Again, since this is a new person speaking, he needs a new paragraph.]\nI snuffled, “I… I want to change…” [if possible, I suggest emphasizing the word ""want"" here]\nHe sighed and tapped both his thighs with his hands. “I’ll be here. We’ll all be here.” [comma should be a period here]\n“I also want to… want to say s-sorry to everyone.”\n“Of course, of course. But I won’t help you apologize,"" (Ash insisted.) ""You need to man up and admit your wrongs, apologize wholeheartedly and show remorse, perhaps?"" (He then continued.) ""Remember, ‘I’m sorry’s\' are worthless no matter how many times a person says it if they don’t show the other party how sorry they really are and how much they regret their choices.""\n(He glanced away for a moment, as if in thought. Then, he turned back towards me.) ""It may be (that)… the whole concept of being sorry may be difficult for a four-year-old but I want to tell you this so that when you grow up and finally understand the concept of asking for forgiveness and forgiving, you’ll know what to do.”\nAgain, my suggestions are mostly ""nit-picky"" and nothing too serious. The chapter itself was quite strong! I enjoyed reading it.', ""I took almost all of your suggestions and edited my chapter. The only thing I changed is:\n\n\nthirdly:\nMy appetite diminished to the point that I played with my food instead of consuming any of it, as if I were stuck in a perpetual daze of numbness.\nI changed it to My appetite diminished to the point that I hurled whenever I looked at my food. If I stared at it for more than a minute and I would start to vomit acid out of my mouth. because she really doesn't eat well during her whole punishment thing.\nI also added some words like I snuffled, “I… I want to change. Can you help me? Please help me...”\nOverall, I took your suggestions and it actually became more readable and better than the original one. \nThank you!"", 'That still sounds good to me. The reason I thought about \'playing with food\' was because as children, we\'re usually scolded for doing that. You\'re the one that knows what the main character is/should be feeling at any given moment. Most of what I caught were little things. It\'s hard as the writer to catch these things because you\'re always thinking of ""what happens after this scene?"" Just always try to remember to give hints as to what the main character is thinking (especially during dramatic moments!) for the sake of the readers (this is what keeps us on the edge of our seats waiting anxiously as to what happens next, how the character is feeling about the situation) and to separate paragraphs/sentence quotes from one character to the next. I have several friends that help me catch what I miss (for example, in my story, I kept misspelling a word that I myself made-up towards the end). So, never be afraid to ask a friend to give it a glance.']",4/26/2021 10:16,https://forums.tapas.io/t/closed-can-someone-give-me-a-review-feedback-for-this-chapter/58074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","[""I feel very insecure about giving feedback since I am not a native English speaker nor an experienced writer. So forgive me if I say anything wrong.\nI read 5 episodes so far and I think the story is good, the murder mystery is intriguing, it would be a hell of a plot twist if somehow Enrique is the murderer :D.\nIt is a little bit short for me though, things are happening kinda fast so I may have lost sense of the timeline and space.\nAlso in ep2 there seemed to be an error where some of the words are not seperated like here:\na.PNG1323x284 55.4 KB\n\nYou can easily find and edit those through grammarly free version or google docs or any other software.\nFinally, like I said, the story is interesting I'll keep reading!"", ""@childofbooks thanks Eli for your help, I understood all what you wrote so don't hesitate to share your comments.About Enrique...

"", 'I think it is well written, but I have to agree with the person above: the chapters are far too short for my liking. Things are moving incredibly fast, and we don\'t really get to bond with the characters like we are supposed to. It feels like a good premise, but I feel no connection, no storyline, almost like ""oh we start here and this happens then this "" but we have no idea how we got from a to b. We have no idea about the characters and who they are, what their personality is, and who they are as people. \nYou really need to expand those chapters and expand the story. Sorry if this is harsh.', ""Thanks for your comment and don't worry about being harsh, at this moment is necessary. Now, I have a BIG question:\nWould be correct to edit that episodes and unify them (in some cases) or just leave it in that way and continue? \nThanks again for your feedback "", ""I would unify them or just expand on them. Add setting. That is the big thing that is missing. There is no real setting, and that isn't just where we are. I need: time, place, personality, etc."", 'Okay, thanks for the advised. Also, until which episode has you read?', 'I read until chapter 5! ', ""Great! Thanks for the information, you can't imagine how useful has been your feedback "", 'You\'re very welcome, glad to help.\nAnd I just checked the word ""emissarie"" :D. Well, I\'m honored.', 'The length of the single episodes is not the main problem here, just the byproduct. As the others said, there is just not enough information. I read the first 6 episodes and heard about several people, but have no idea who they are, where they are or what they are doing. I have no clue what their place in this world or story is.And don\'t get this wrong, those are not the only questions I would want answers to.\nA big point for me, next to the characters, was also the world. You wrote a century into the description of the novel, but you did not describe anything in this world besides ""old bookstore"" or ""horses instead of cars"". That gives still a lot of open and blank space and time to envision.And to better get a sense for the time period, maybe try to use fitting names. I only have one example but it stuck out to me: You called the law enforcement ""police"". That would make sense if the main character would describe these people and make a comparison to what he knows. But as you used it, it seemed like they were also called that in this world, which seems odd for another time period and even world/society.\nAll in all it would benefit your world and the relationship of the reader to the main character if we would get to see him arrive in this world and come to know it. This is always a great opportunity to teach the reader and the character all they need to know about this world in the same time. And seeing how the main character reacts to the differences gives the reader a clue on who he is. (if you want the reader to learn slower, you can do that, but in that case you also have to describe what is happening in greater detail)\nSlow down, take your time with scenes and characters, and keep in mind, that you may know everything about this world, because it lives in your head, but the reader has to see it too.\nIt might seem hard because you already got so far in your story, but I would probably suggest a rewrite, if you want to enhance this story. But if your goal with this is mainly learning and getting better you could just try to improve what you write from here on out. Just keep in mind that this story, in this form, might not hook a lot of readers to stay with it.\nI hope this helps and keeps you going ', ""Thanks for the feedback, I read every word with attention and now I need to think a lot of things T_TIt's hard but in certain way this would help me to see new perspectives.\nThanks again and If there is more people that have read some episodes you are welcome to leave your comments.\nHave a great week ""]",4/24/2021 18:44,https://forums.tapas.io/t/anxious-author-looking-for-help/58014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the other one is breathing? Where did this very conveniently placed and random screwdriver head come from? Why does opening the vent indicate that he wasn’t getting air? \nIt will help to incorporate some establishing shots so we know the setting and where the characters are in the space. Especially since your story seems to be an “escape” story, the location is particularly important. You also want to make sure you aren’t breaking the 180 degree rule. \nAnd as another piece of advice... sub 4 sub threads will very very rarely get you actual readers. If you’re spending a lot of time promoting there I would consider investing your time just working on making your comic better instead, and getting feedback is a good start.', ""oh okay thank you  this is very eye-opening to what I need to focus on. \nLess subtleness.

I checked a while your piece. I Read it all until ep, 14, and I have made myself an opinion.We have absolutely no idea what is going on. In what kind of world they are. What is their porpuse, etc. And on a personal note, I think that its too hard to make comical and horror to work together, but that is only my opinion.\nAbout the storytelling, maybe you would like to check some concepts, like the the hero's journey1, and try to stick to only 1 genre for now. Because you may want to do too much and don't get to do them all.\nI know that it may be hard to hear, because you have invested time and effort into this comic, but I am not saying that your work is horrible, but as you recognice, it may need more work in certain areas. I don't know if you have done this before, but try to do some short comics. One or two pages. Grab some micro stories and try to put them into those 2 pages. It helps you to develop a lot of abilities, and at the same time it helps you to get confortable with the software and work other areas such as color, style, palette, etc.\nHere its an example from me (I just translated for you, so sorry if there is a syntax problem)\n01.jpg752x1064 788 KB\n\n\n02.jpg752x1064 947 KB\n\nLastly, your biggest problem arise since chapter 11-12.

I am not clear if they knew each other from before, if they meet at the lab (I am not even clear if they now that they were on a lab!), or if they are talking for the first time, and all the action from there it can't be well followed if that issue its not answered, Why are they casually stoping to eat? Why aren't they searching for help in authorities? Why do they need to keep as a group? There is a lot of question that you need to answer before to all make sense, and that doesn't mean spoil your mystery. You have to set some basic rules for everyone to know. Only when you know very well how to do that, you can play it otherwise, like the movie 'Hereditary', where the script is done with the idea to hide everything from the viewer to add suspense.\nWell, I think that most comments have already told you a lot on what to work, plus mine, so I gonna leave it at that. Hope that this helps you accomplish your goals!"", 'Hi, thank yo for reading. This white noise project is a long-term growth project for me.

Especially in the first two episodes, it\'s very clean. I\'m assuming you\'ve re-done those more recently? They read much better than the later ones. No problems at all with that art style, it\'s at a solid point in its development, it\'ll draw in readers, not put them off. So, that\'s good!\nYou\'re facing an uphill battle getting subs on a mobile-focused app with a traditionally panelled comic. Vertical scroll will serve you better. I made that change around 5 episodes into my comic, and it was a fantastic decision.\nYou\'re also facing an uphill battle with a black and white comic - but given the genre, if you\'re not extremely skilled with colour, it\'s probably a good choice.\nYour summary is very well written, so I can tell you know how to write clearly. But the comic is really confusing. That\'s because you can\'t rely only on dialogue to establish tone, setting, background lore, and so-on - and what you can indicate through dialogue needs to be subtle and well-placed. You need to think more like a filmmaker than a novelist.\nIf this is to be a compelling horror comic, it needs more suspense. A vertical comic is better for this, because the scrolling format can do things like fade to black, scroll down through sound effects like a scream, or the tapping of a knife against a hand... and so-on.\nAlso in the filmmaker repertoire, establishing shots. They\'re so important! I\'m currently only guessing at how big the room they\'re in is. Later on, when they\'re in the car, zoom out to show the environment they\'re driving through. Same with the house, I have no idea what kind of location that\'s in. There\'s a similar issue with the corridors, and the vents to a lesser extent. As a general rule, every time a scene changes location, you need an establishing shot. I know drawing environments is a challenge, but it\'s so, so worth it.\nI know time is probably of the essence, but I think the guy being tortured needs to be way more suspicious and resentful of the guy who, even though he\'s rescuing him now, was torturing him not too long ago. You don\'t just get over that so quickly.\nUse a hazy panel border to differentiate what your protagonist is remembering from the past (the torture) from what\'s happening in the present. Otherwise, it looks like it\'s happening in the present, which is confusing.\nAlso, a line like ""...is he helping me? What the hell is going on?"" when he finds the gun pieces would establish to the reader that the torturer intends to help the protagonist escape.\nUse a more standardised standard comic font. You don\'t want your lettering to stand out - that breaks immersion. You want a reader to barely notice it, unless it\'s a sound effect. The typed font is jarring because it doesn\'t look like it belongs in a comic, while the handwritten lettering is hard to read. Komika has a free-to-use comic font which reads clearly, and has a lowercase option. It\'s what I use. I highly recommend it.\nIf your comic in mostly monochromatic, you should push the shadows and lighting on your characters. Don\'t leave them flat. It helps with atmosphere, which is essential for horror. Also, push your value ranges! Lean into higher contrast.\n\nThat\'s about all I\'ve got so far. Horror is very much not my cup of tea, I\'m a wuss, but there\'s a lot of raw promise here, in both the art and the writing, which is only muddied by your unfamiliarity with the storytelling medium of comics. The more webcomics you read, the more familiar you will become with that medium. Where to use establishing shots, how to use close-ups for suspense, and how to communicate backstory, character thoughts, and emotion without narration are the things you want to pay attention to as you\'re reading the work of other creators.\nIf you haven\'t read The Croaking on WEBTOON, I\'d suggest it; I think you may like it, it\'s a WEBTOON original, so it has an editor (meaning the fundamentals are strong), and I think you could learn a lot from studying how the creator uses dialogue to establish unique lore, as well as her camera work.\nFinally, a word of caution; sub-for-sub is worse than useless. You get numbers without gaining active readers, which can seriously mess you up with the algorithms sites like Tapas and WEBTOON use for promotion and visibility. Don\'t do it. Instead, make sure your cover and banner are both eye catching, with really good art, and promote in regular promo threads, and on comic subreddits and your social media.', 'Thank you VERY much! IM probably going to read this over and over as I progress. Thank you!', ""You're very welcome! A lot of those tips are very fresh in my mind because I'm still a comic newbie myself, and it's all stuff which I've had to focus on and address in my own work. You've got the perfect mindset for a first comic; it's a learning experience. That's how I'm approaching mine, as well. "", ""Hello! Your art is really good! I would suggest checking out some other webcomics because your formatting seems a little confusing to me. Personally, I like to put space between certain panels to create a pause for dramatic effect or during a scene change. Another thing is to give it some time. I can see that you started pretty recently, and I started publishing on tapas a few months ago and only have 250 subs compared to my 8.7k subs on webtoon. So eventually, I'm sure they'll slowly start to build up! I found it was easier to build an audience on webtoon and promote my tapas series."", ""Thank you  and I've been looking and I see what you are saying on the format.

Realmwalker: Saga of Frost | Tapas
Part 2 of RealmWalker! 
2 years after the events of the first comic, Gunhild receives an invite to her half sisters' wedding. But things are not as they seem... an army of frost giants is threatening to invade! But Gunhild's got fire on her side....





","['It\'s great that you\'re looking to improve your comic! I think it has a really unique concept to it and you have lots of potential as a creator. I\'ll try to focus in on where you can make the get the biggest and most impactful improvements here.\nThe panelling immediately jumps out as an area where the comic could look more polished simply by switching from panels divided by lines to ones divided by full gutters. Try searching for some tutorials online for ""[whatever program you use] comic panel tutorial"".The speech bubbles as well could be neater if they were made using some kind of shape tool rather than drawn freehand. It\'s a small thing but would add a lot to the overall presenation.A more comic looking font would probably help with polish as well. Assuming you\'re probably making this with no budget, the two places I\'d recommend looking for a font would be Blambot (look for the ones that cost $0) and Google Fonts filtered to ""handwritten"" (ignore anything cursive, obviously).\n\nblambot.com\n\n\n\nDialogue Fonts\nComic Book Fonts and Custom Design by Blambot.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfonts.google.com\n\n\n\nGoogle Fonts\nMaking the web more beautiful, fast, and open through great typography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe characters aren\'t poorly drawn, and I can see you\'re making effort to push yourself to draw more backgrounds, so the main area to improve the art is that a lot of the panels tend to be one or two characters standing facing the camera right in the middle of a panel, often with more space around them than they really need. Try experimenting with some close-ups, or say, and over-the-shoulder of one character talking to another where we see one of them from behind. Here\'s a popular comics meme that gets shared a lot that might give you some ideas:\n\nwally_woods_22_panels.jpg999x763 243 KB\n\nIt looks like you\'re definitely doing more panels in later pages where we see some shots of characters doing things like sitting on a windowsill, lying on a bench, walking to a place in a wide shot etc. So just keep pushing there and see if you can start adding variety to how you draw the characters even when they\'re just standing and talking.', ""Thank you!

Updates Tuesdays and...





","[""A couple of things:\n\nGive it time  I see your first episode was posted on March 5th. It takes quite a bit of time to build a following, and your series has only just started. My numbers were basically stuck for well over two months... until I realized that my problem was indeed the genre I picked (Mystery), which nobody seems to check. Once I switched to Horror as my main genre, I eventually managed to get a few new readers. If you see that your episodes keep going unnoticed, I'd suggest changing your main genre too and see what happens  slice of life, among the ones you have, seems to be pretty popular, so you might try that one.\nI'd really, really suggest using a bigger font. I have to admit I struggled more than a little to read the text in your panels, and my desktop is pretty big. A lot of Tapas users are checking the site from mobile, which means that, if your text is too small, they simply won't be able to read your comic and give up on it. Try switching to a bigger font size (10 px at very least, though personally I went for an ever bigger size, 30px) for easier readibility  \n\nYour art is lovely, btw! "", ""Like @Llyrel said these things take time. Give it a few months, promote your comic on other platforms like twitter or topwebcomics or something like that.\n\n\nLlyrel:\nI'd really, really suggest using a bigger font.\nJust to build off this, not only should your text be bigger your speech bubbles should also be bigger and better placed. After looking at a few pages, it feels as though you draw the pages first in their entirety then you add the speech bubbles in place that feel convenient (though I could be wrong). Instead, consider when you draw the pages, like when your sketching the pages, to also draw where the speech bubble will be placed then. And to draw them in a way that leads the eye. Take a look at this page:\nimage.png758x537 345 KB\n\nWhat's the order of the speech bubbles? I think it's most likely the red line, but someone could easily think it's the blue. An easier read would've been this because the bubbles lead into each other:\nimage.png758x537 356 KB\n\nAnd the last two bubbles would overlap because he seems to be interrupting whatever he's listening to. That's just one thing I think can be improved upon. Hope this helps!"", 'Besides all that has been said already, my biggest problem is if you have 5, or 10 pages, submitt them in the same episode. As you have done a full chapter of 53 pages, you have made also the script in that way. There are little cliffhangers here and there, that force you to keep looking, but most of the time its slow suspense as page 07, that it works as a whole chapter, but not as much if you have to keep scrolling down, and wait for the load page to charge. It kills the suspense.\nBy the way, I absolutely love the way you use colors in your work. That is your strongest point right now. That, and if we read all in one go (without the loading), the script.', 'I was very worried when I read "" I drew the first chapter two years ago"" and ""It hasn\'t even reached 25 subscribers"".

Maybe... Psetha\'s Abduction and Bilana Arrives?\nAlso, seeing the ""POV"" titles led me to think that in ""Bilana\'s POV"" I was going to see that abduction scene from another angle.

You clearly have a sense of composition and the pages are easy to read, I understand what\'s going on in every panel and I can read the sequence. \nYou may want to to work on your speech bubbles and lettering. You generally want the words to fit the shape of the speech bubble, so no awkward \'waists\' where one line in the middle of shorter than the ones above and below it. Here\'s a quite detailed guide on dos and don\'ts of lettering.2\nI would also say to practice on drawing hands. You can simplify them into blobs if you want to, sometimes, but in other places they\'re a bit harder to read. For example, the fist in the panel with the man breathing fire, and the first panel on the  page below that with the injured worried boy. Those are just a bit too hard to see and think ""hand"". The hands on the kneeling man in the first panel works, though, because it\'s at such a distance and the pose is so readable otherwise that I can understand it. \nThat\'s kinda nitpicky though, the overall look is pretty good!', 'I really love the simple, clean black and white artwork you have!

Those are so scary, and you did a great job with their design! Tilted, smiling heads, desiccated bodies...terrifying! I love it! However, I think the background does not do them justice. You could really punch up the effect of their moment by giving a little more attention to the detail and atmosphere. \nRight now, they are ""trees"". Standard trees that don\'t say anything about the setting, the tone, etc. If they aren\'t communicating anything, why are they there at all? But we still need a background, right?\nA teacher of mine once told us to draw a tree without looking at one, and the result was a lot of these ""standard"" trees. Then he had us all go outside to draw actual trees. The result was fantastic! They really don\'t take long to draw, and they are really fun detailing all the knots, texture of bark etc etc\nAfter the tree exercise, you can play with the values, shadows, shapes...make it a spooky tree. Because the trees you find in a beautiful meadow full of friendly critters are going to look different from the ones you find those creatures lurking around! \nHere is a very quick drawing of what I mean by all this:\n\nIn any medium, we have to be intentional in what we put on the page/screen. I can tell from the first panel that you\'re really good at shadow and pushing value patterns! Take advantage of that and those trees and use them to make those creatures even more scary!!

For example...in the panel where it starts off with ""Toshiro passed the test, right?"" I would leave only THAT word bubble there as is...then on the left side I would show the rest of the dialogue in another box (or a hexagon, or some other not-bubble shape) as if it were a script...\nSuyo: The reason why we\'ve been having these sparring matches against Axel...\nJust to break the word bubbles up a bit.

I am generally a good writer, but I feel like when I try to translate it over to a graphic novel, It kinda gets a bit muddy due to my workflow being a lot different (more focused on art than writing most of the time, as it's more time consuming.""

Ryoshi | Tapas
Sato Hijiri is the son of ""Stone Dragon"" Ryuzo Hijiri, better known as the leader of the Red Sun Clan. A fledgeling Ryoshi, Sato aims to follow in his fathers footsteps as a hunter of evil beings known as Yokai.
But when a traditional Ryoshi ritual...





","['Hey there! I took a look at what you\'ve got so far and here are my thoughts:\n1) I really like your summary, but I would cut the beginning part. I had to reread the first couple of sentences several times to understand them because there was a lot of vocabulary - not in the sense that the words are big, but there\'s a lot of names to learn, and you want your summary to hook readers in two seconds. \n""When a traditional Ryoshi ritual goes wrong, Sato finds himself transformed into one of the very beings he was meant to destroy. Now he must find a way to rid himself of his curse, as well as hunt down the one responsible for it."" <-- This part is fantastic and I think this is all you need.\n2) I think the pacing is good - but the problem right now is there is no tension. As a reader I don\'t really care if Sato succeeds or fails, which might cause me to not read any further. There\'s a lot of reassurance that he won\'t and his dad mentions something about ""danger"" but why should I care if he fails? Is all of humanity doomed if he fails? Is it just bringing immense shame upon his family? Maybe people have doubted him his whole life and this is his one chance to prove himself? Is it something he\'s worked for? \n3) This might just be me, but it was a little bit strange to switch from a third person (intro chapter) to the first person narrative (last chapter). I think it would be cool to have Sato be the one narrating it in the first chapter - you can keep the beginning part the same but at the end add maybe something like, ""This is what it means to be Ryoshi. This is the destiny that I have chosen/must follow/to follow my dad\'s legacy."" (insert panel of Sato, introducing him as the main character to the audience) And then maybe something like ""Everything I\'ve worked for has led up to this moment"" or ""Humanity will be destroyed if I don\'t succeed"" to add the tension like I mentioned earlier.\nAnyway, good work! I think your story has a lot of potential! ', 'Thank you very much for your well though out response! I can see what you mean by the rituals danger not being apparent. I myself know what the danger is, and was going to reveal it just before the ritual began. But maybe it would be a good idea to reveal that information earlier. Also, I like your idea of a first person intro and just might change it to that. I will also cut down on the summary.\nAll very good points that I agree with after having them pointed out, thank you!', ""You're welcome! Glad you found some of what I said helpful. \nI do think that revealing the danger makes a story more interesting. For instance, consider the two scenarios:\n1) There's a man trapped in a room.\n(Cool. I'm kinda intrigued.)\n2) There's a man trapped in a room. In the corner, a ticking time bomb. \n(Now I'm intrigued AND I want to know what's going to happen next. )\nAlso, your story's genre is not something I tend to gravitate towards but I still found the premise compelling, so that's gotta count for something!""]",4/22/2021 15:27,https://forums.tapas.io/t/feedback-on-my-comics-pacing/57929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your first sentence is really important in a description, you need to hook the readers in, not give them a list.\nThen you give us a summary, which again, falls flat.\nI would like to help you write a better description, but I'd need to know more about your story. Is it okay if I DM you?"", 'Yes. Feel free to DM me.', 'Firstly, your title looks awkward to me. Maybe it\'s just the phrasing that\'s off, but it just sounds almost like a bad google translate result.\n""Drama/YA Contemporary/Coming of Age"" This makes the whole thing sound more like a bad marketing pitch to a publisher than something I\'d actually expect to see on Tapas and want to read. In fact, as far as I\'m concerned, ""contemporary"" is bad enough(as I personally don\'t look much for contemporary much, and because I believe it\'d be harder to write contemporary well, which is a bad mix with a website like Tapas where anyone and their dog can post content), but seeing YA and Contemporary in the same sentence leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n""Two classmates with animosity go through their own stories of emotional, physical and psychological struggle and growth during middle school and high school, which parallel each other through the years.""\nThis suffers the same overarching problem that I think most descriptions that I see here suffer, being that it\'s too vague to mean anything to me. If I could just give you the shortest-path solution, look at the Amazon description for The Blade Itself; it mentions several different characters who have shitty lives, but actually mentions meaningful details about each of their individual characters that\'s actually likely to rope the reader into the ring, so to speak. Giving similar, meaningful details to each of the characters in the description would help massively. That last bit (""which parallel each other through the years."") should also be axed, as it should speak for itself and it shouldn\'t matter to anyone who\'s merely slightly interested in reading your book.\n""Then four years after high school, the victims of both of their past actions come back to haunt them when they are forced to be quarantined together at their former middle school for two weeks.""  Now, in tandem  with the last sentence, this actually isn\'t all that bad, as it at least starts to get the reader asking fun questions about what the hell those kids were doing earlier in their lives, with the hidden inference that the main characters are serial killers or something. Though, I have to admit that aside from that the sentence doesn\'t give enough context to not be confusing. Why would they be quarantined in an abandoned school? Like, instead of their houses or a tent made by the CDC?\n""Written In Third Person. "" Ditch this. Most people don\'t care about whether the story is written in third or first, so long as it\'s done well, and having it there tells me you may have the wrong priorities as a writer.""Coming Of Age Story."" I question how the hell this is supposed to be a coming of age story when you\'ve just inferred that our main characters are serial killers who are also dealing with... puberty. Wait, what? On a more serious note, you could fold a note about this into the normal description.\nNow for the similar stories list. If I saw that on a physical book at the bookstore, I\'d be morbidly curious, to say the least, though I\'d also be somewhat off-put. On a site like Tapas, however, I interpret this as a pretty massive red flag. Firstly, it\'s a pretty broad set of influences, to say the least. Second of all, It\'s one thing to be loosely inspired by one or two books you like, but another entirely to claim your book is vaguely similar to five other books that people actually know about, that just sounds like you don\'t know what your book\'s actually like. Overall, I\'d recommend axing it entirely.\nOverall evaluation, 3.5/10.']",4/21/2021 11:52,https://forums.tapas.io/t/critique-and-feedback-on-my-novels-description/57883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every Element in a drawing competes with each other for the viewers attention. Some things draw more attention than others, like geometric shapes, high contrasts, and as humans we are super quick to recognize faces. Because we are so wired to find faces tho, we subconsciously look for them in patterns as well... like in a plane of wood, or clouds. \nthat's one of the reasons patterns also draw your focus a lot. \nin the page you gave me, the blue cloud stuff makes the middle part super busy, and draws a lot of the attention. you can literally just cut it completely and let the viewer focus on just the character that is already doing a lot. \nalong the same line, because every element draws focus, a page/illustration with ONLY busy parts, gets really exhausting to look at. you'd usually want to have some balance between busy areas in a drawing and ones that are calm. \n\nimage.png680x981 433 KB\n\nThere were minor issues with the purple character. the collar of the shirt didn't follow the shape and perspective of the characters neck, which gave them a hunchback. and the headshape was very unbalanced ... kinda jimmy neutron-ish. Keep in mind that even cartoonisch characters have skulls  even tho squish and stretch applies... the character is in a deadpan expression, so they would have their default skull shape \na last thing that would improve your work a lot, would be Line weight. your lines are a bit whimsical in their thickness and tapers. \n\nimage.png531x647 117 KB\n\nimage.png732x730 98.9 KB\n\nlike here, the cheeks and arms have the thickest lines. the lines around the forehead are super slim. throughout the page there isn't really a method behind it, but maybe you could give it one. \na popular and well applicable system is to use line weight to indicate the light direction and distance(seperate fore and background)if it's in the shadow, thick line. is it in the light thin line. and otherwise, keep the line rather consistent in width throughout it."", 'Thank you for the advice.\nThe hunchback made me laugh, now that I take a closer look at it! I\'ll definitely keep an eye out for that in the future. You\'re right about the blobby bits too. Sometimes I just have the urge to add a texture to something, and based on the results, I\'m sure you can tell how that usually turns out.\nAnd thanks for the info about line weight as well (I\'m still not very good at it).\nA ""much appreciated"" for you, and a ""much to practice"" for me!', ""I don't want want my art to be judged ^^( i knew exactly that i am lacking in many ways) Just here to say it's really cool of you to propose to help others !( instead of all those promo thread i saw ) it's really refreshing ~ "", 'OOkay! first off, I haven\'t quite caught up with your story, I think I\'m somewhere on chapter4? but it\'s really enjoyable so far and your art is pretty good! the characters usually have really good anatomy and expressions!\none of the ""quick fixes"" on that page is the perspective on the first panel. I went back to check, and the dark chara stands on the ground. but the perspective is as if they were standing on a roof! which makes it weird that you can only see the sky and a (in that context) weirdly tall plant. (on both of them, you look at them from slightly above, rather than from below\nnow to the meat of this post like you said yourself, there is a dark character in front of a dark background. \ndark scenes are really difficult tho so I get it. you usually have the urge to use dark colors and up the saturation instead... while it\'s actually the other way round. when you are in a room with low lighting, you can\'t disttinguish colors anymore, that\'s because our eye has two different cells. Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels (scotopic vision). They do not mediate color vision, and have a low spatial acuity.Cones are active at higher light levels (photopic vision), are capable of color vision and are responsible for high spatial acuity.\nthe closer to your center field of vision the more cones there are. while on the edges you have more rods. this is because rods are exceptional at seeing movement! aka you need them to react quickly to approaching danger. and they are that more active in low light for the same reason. \nwhat does it mean for art: if you draw a scene with high lighting, you can go really comorful (tho it\'s advisable to still keep athmospheric lighting and cholor balance in check), but when you draw a dark scene, you can go desaturated and/or almost monochrome! \nhere\'s an extreme example by days e and Mienar\nimage.png564x752 557 KB\n\nimage.png480x581 352 KB\n\nIn the case of your page, that would mean using a color for the sky that is light enough to not blend with the dark character and desaturating it enough to look like night. as well as lowering the saturaion of the palm, building and ground. \nI know you do color grading a lot! theres a scene where the mc meets the bunny character during sunset and everything is tinted a bit. That\'s great and you can really tell the difference between the different light situations. \nin the instant of this page it\'s a bit lacking still tho. the sky is super blue, yet the ground is rather neutral if not warm, even though it should be tinted by the athmospheric lighting to avoid making the different parts of the page look like different settings\nthe last thing I want to talk about is the glow. using the airbrush tool to make the area around the character is fair! but since most of your comic is cel shaded, maybe you can find a way that looks less smudgy (you already use light blue lineart to convey her glow, and I think that is really neat and effective plus works with the rest of the comic\'s style). .. but that is rather nitpicky of me. \nwhat is more impactful though, is how she, as a lightsource, should affect her surroundings. here the blurryness of the airbrush really clashes with your usual coloring and shading style. don\'t hesistate and make the light and shadows bolder, use hard rimlights and use her as a source for athmospheric ligting as well, when she\'s in an enclosed space like a room or even the crater.you already demonstrated that you are good with hard shading, so I think you could absolutely pull off a bolder approach!(sorry my phrasing sounds like ""you should"" but this is really a taste thing in the end I think and I mean it as a suggestion more than anything. I\'m just bad at words) \nhere\'s what I mean for the color grading etc:\nimage.png595x842 331 KB\n', ""@BarBarKetrab hah I feel you, the urge to add stuff to backgrounds is really strong.in your first few episodes with the snow, you use a lot of texture, and that works pretty well. But texture and patterns are quite different . but yea. if in doubt, keep it simple! oh and the reason why it does work in the first panel, is because the colored area has hard edges! (the circle and white lines) and the character still has the biggest contrast/ draws the most attention thanks to the white shape behind it! \n@Indigo-Child thank you! I really enjoy doing this kinda thing, and I personally also love receiving this kind of analysis/feedback,,, sooo be the change you wanna see and all that  and eh, I still plugged my comic, so I'm not super selfless either :')"", ""Thanks so much for the advice! I had no idea how many night scenes I'd end up doing 'til I looked back at my outline when I finally started illustrating this project. I wish I had studied more about lighting and shading before I started, honestly I was just winging it. Now that I look back, it does look like Nyct is up high lol.\nI know that one scene in chapter 2 with Tamani (the bunny girl) was something that I had fixed up last minute before I posted which was about a year after I drew it. It looked a lot brighter then, you wouldn't even tell the sun was setting. But there are later night scenes that have a few saturation problems so I definitely need to study more."", ""This is so generous of you, thank you!\nI'll drop one of my older pages here, because I intend to re-do the first few pages of my comic to add more establishing characterisation and a better build up to the initial action, and I want that moment to be as impactful as possible. I really loved this page when I first drew it 3 months ago, but looking at it now, I can tell it needs work.\nBTW, I am always up for critical feedback on my art, if you're offering. Especially regarding composition. It's one of my weaker skills. (That's partly why I've moved away from page format - I'm producing every episode vertically now, though that certainly has its challenges as well. Reformatting for print is going to be a tedious exercise, haha.)\n\nChapter 1 Page 4.JPG940x1410 398 KB\n"", 'I mean, your night scenes arent bad at all!\nsure the colors could improve, but the level it\'s at now, already works really way. so it\'s more of a ""if you have time and energy to delve more into it, cool, if not, thats fine too."" ... if you know what I mean \nthe best thing if it\'s just saturation and colors... you can just put an adjustment layer over it and don\'t really have to redraw anything', 'OHH this is a difficult one. I\'m already a big fan of your work. like. Everthing looks like it has mass and depth, there isn\'t anything wrong with anatomy or poses either. (anything you could ""improve"" in that area would lead to vast changes in style, so that\'s really just a matter of where you are aiming towards. tho I love the way it is rn) \nfor the page specifically, (I also looked again at your vertical version) I think the three panels are too equally zoomed in? there is a lot happening with the attack and the whole ship gets shakenso the panel where he falls down is an action shot, even tho it is zoomed in like a reaction shot, and could use some more context/more room to really show the action. Then the reaction shot of his face would have more meaningas well! \nthe whiskey glass is fine, tho there\'s a lot of attention drawn to it. which is fine, but there\'s two reasons ""against"" it as well. \nit gets the same level of importance as the character, it would better fit into the action shot where it ""breaks"" instead of showing it ""already broken... that way the action scene gets more oomf and more ""action"". \naaand. you have a really good use of that shot later! \n\nimage.png423x747 105 KB\n\nlike. I loved that panel and actively remebered it since it tells us a lot about the character a well (him getting attacked by space pirates, but being pretty much chill and only really caring about the whiskey) \nand since you have this, the first time you show the broken glass, makes the second, more impactful time, a repetition. \neven if you completely cut the glass form the attack scene, he used it very prominently before while he was chill, so the shot where he says ""wate of a good whiskey"" would still work even without showing the glass inbetween. \n\nthe choice to pull the panels apart a bit in the vertical one, is good! in the page format, it feels a bit unbalanced with too much on the bottom half and too littlein the top half of the image. it would probably help to give the spaceshhip more space and  not overlap it with the panel AND the text. and rather have it as it\'s own panel. even if the panel has no border. the space as a backdrop for the whole page is really cool after all. \non the vertical one... everything is a bit too big? his reaction shot and he glass take up the whole phone screen, and on desktop....\n\nimage.png1480x843 557 KB\n\nimage.png1464x857 600 KB\n\nI have to zoom out to 30% to read it cpmfortably \n\nimage.png1872x1077 352 KB\n\nhaving the parts of the head cut off to have the effect of being close into his face is good!

(if you really want to improve your characters, I think a good next step would be to work on the clothes.. specifically folds etc, so the materials get across a bit better. for that nothing goes over studies and references. but yea, that\'s a minor thing) \nnow, there\'s a few things that would improve it that are unrelated to your drawing skills, because they are is safe waters. you even change up poses during longer convos.\nfirstly layout. \nthere is a LOT of text. in your exampes as well... while I\'m reading through the first few pages as well. so this seems pretty consistent \n\nimage.png761x760 668 KB\n\nand it\'s not just the volume.. the way the characters talk feels a bit unnatural as well. it conveys the info, yes, but it\'s a bit dry? and sometimes very much for the reader\'s sake. Who, honestly, can most of the time fill the gaps themselves from context clues or from the characters reaction and reply.. even if it\'s just implicit. \nthe paneling itself is solid! the sizes are great for desktop and mobile alike. \nnot to the meat and the part where I\'m the most comfortable at feedbacking. I am going to be a bit influenced by personal taste... and I\'ll be a bit blunt probably. since you said to ""tear it to shreds"" I think you are prepared .. .I hope. but still, don\'t worry. you do have a really solid comic here. what I\'m going to be going on about is for /additional/ visual appeal.\nthat said. \nyour pages could look a lot more fun with more distinct light and color direction. /color grading. \nyou already use very different light settings in some parts like these:\n\nimage.png564x781 532 KB\n \nimage.png589x789 614 KB\n\nbut in the space ship with the gray walls, when you use perfectly neutral gray... it gets bland really qickly. \nthe color of the scene will set the mood, so a neutral gray is .. too neutral to say anything about it. It also usually makes scenes distinct /cues in on changes in location etc\naaaand the execution isn\'t ideal yet either. like, take the page right above. you have two different scenes. the one at the car, and then the one in the house. but the characters are still colored identically even tho the lighting changed. (most easy to see with the green jacket. \nand that\'s a general trend I\'ve seen, that the character\'s colors, don\'t quite fit into the scenes, Which isn\'t helped by the characters colors themselves. like the red haired character. her Hair and eyes are at Maximum saturation while the clothes, and skin are completely desturated. I did some color picking: \n\nimage.png495x549 276 KB\n\nif there is light that isn\'t pure white (which is almost never the case, since most light sources have a temperature, and if not, there will be bouncelight from the surroundings which will give it a tint) then any object that is colored neutral like completely desaturated white or gray and even black, WILL get tinted. \nthat applies in art most noticable in eyes. having them pure white in a drawing with backgrounds, almost always looks weird. \nnow the opposite case with the completely saturated colors... \ncolors get usually broken by the light source unless the light has the same color as the object, are a lightsource themselves, or are exposed to really bright white light. that\'s why having two colors that are maximum saturation (and even more, dark and saturated) in the same place feels kinda off and you will rarely find it in visual media unless there\'s a color scheme going on or the like. \neven just pulling the colors a bit more together, will give a more coherent result:\n\nFor the scenes as a whole situation is the same the backgrounds are mostly neural grey. \na possible fix is to either work with a fixed color scheme for scenes like Hilda (webcomic and Netflix series) does for example or use overlays and adjustment layers. that way the characters will also get tinted and everything gets pulled together a bit. \nI\'ll do it for a few pages for demonstration\n\nimage.png735x1040 947 KB\n\nimage.png552x791 632 KB\n\nimage.png528x759 384 KB\n\nimage.png534x760 405 KB\n\nimage.png572x798 615 KB\n\nimage.png590x817 612 KB\n\nI hope it helps! there\'s a lot of tutorials on how to use color out there as well.

131,Thoughts on my Plot Description?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So, I just started uploading my first 'serious' series on Tapas today, and I'm generally happy with how things are going so far, but one thing is bugging me: my plot description.
I'm not sure if it's good or bad myself, but I think it could be improved. I would appreciate any help in pointing out flaws and if you have any tips on how to make it better, please tell me.
Here is my description:
In the centre of the silent land of Loderfine, Cinna Annis couldn't be more content with his life. All of his needs are met, and he has all the company he could hope for already in the form of his one best friend. ""All is good"" according to him.
The only thing he has left to do is to convince himself of this fact.
Things become problematic however, when his class supervisor, Guy Robyd, begins acting oddly. Namely, trying to get Cinna to notice his obscure endeavours.........which involve swinging a hammer around. 
Cinna is left with two choices.Either continue his life in Loderfine with the guarantee that he won't be hurt, or come out of his shell and attempt to make it so that none of the people he cares about are hurt instead.
The fact that Guy is involved with reality warping anomalies known as ""Bugs"" doesn't make this an easy decision.","[""Okay, I do think that its too much information, specially if we go and see your work, and is mostly just 2 scenes that are still presenting the series, but are also 15 pages already.I would try to resume everything into the more important ideas. The core of your series. Something like 'The life of Cinna seems an ordeal from his point of view, but he will soon learn that the changes he desires will take him away from the idillic life the he could not comprehend. Reality is not always as it seems'\nAs you see I took away a lot of things from your description, because we will learn them during the series. Now, of course, I might have summarized too much, and may not appeal to people?\nAlso, weird fact that I hope have not discovered by accident something important, the name of the character its almost a palindrome. Cinna Annis, Sinna Annic. Funny.\nGood luck with the description!"", 'Is this your synopsis? Because this is a long synopsis.\n\n\nBarBarKetrab:\n\nIn the centre of the silent land of Loderfine, Cinna Annis couldn\'t be more content with his life, [...] ""All is good"" according to him.\nThe only thing he has left to do is to convince himself of this fact.\nThings become problematic however, when his class supervisor, Guy Robyd, begins acting oddly. Namely, trying to get Cinna to notice his obscure endeavours [...] The fact that Guy is involved with reality warping anomalies known as ""Bugs"" doesn\'t make this an easy decision.\n\nThis could easily be the whole description.', 'Nope, the name is intentional.', 'Thanks for the tips.', 'FYI, took a peel, and the environmental art is really nice in your comic. =)\nBreak down~\n\n\nBarBarKetrab:\n\nIn the centre of the silent land of Loderfine, Cinna Annis couldn\'t be more content with his life. All of his needs are met, and he has all the company he could hope for already in the form of his one best friend. ""All is good"" according to him.\nThe only thing he has left to do is to convince himself of this fact.\n\nWhy silent? Maybe there\'s a more descriptive adjective for the land that gives us a better clue about where we are.  ""Seemingly quiet"" or ""seemingly sleepy"" might lean into the horror/anomaly aspect if silent is meant to evok the idea of a quiet and easy going place- this is usually used to describe a small town, though, and ""land"" makes me feel like we\'re talking about a fantasy country. \nThis might be a nitpick, but I don\'t like the contradiction here about Cinna\'s level of contentment. The easy fix is ""Cinna Annis should be perfectly content with his life."" Then contentful reasons. Then the idea that he\'s not. If you want the contradiction because of the anomalies thing, I feel like you need to find a way to lean harder into it, so readers don\'t just think it\'s a writing mistake. This is the first introduction to your comic, so you can\'t rely on people checking out the comic for context.\n\n\nBarBarKetrab:\nThings become problematic however, when his class supervisor, Guy Robyd, begins acting oddly. Namely, trying to get Cinna to notice his obscure endeavours.........which involve swinging a hammer around.\nThings are already problematic. You just told the reader Cinna\'s lack of contentment is the problem. So maybe a ""Things get worse/more complicated when..."" would be better?\nI also just find this paragraph super confusing. If I knew what was going on I\'d give a suggestion for alternate wording, but I don\'t know what you\'re going for. Vague can absolutely be good, don\'t get me wrong. I don\'t want you necessarily to put in more info, but it might just need some finagling? My current suggestion is to cut it down to something like: Things get more difficult for Cinna when his class supervisor, Guy Robyd begins acting oddly... Soon Cinna will have to choose between remaining safe and comfortable, or protecting the people he cares about most.\nSo something like that. I find the anomalies idea super interesting, so a rewrite that focuses on the reality warping thing would be really interesting. But right now there\'s a LOT going on in your summary, so pairing it down in general and getting specific about what you think is most important to know/hook will help. =)', 'Well, I overhauled it completely. Here\'s the new version:\n\'Cinna Annis is a young individual who should be content with his life. The truth is far from this however, no matter how much he tries to convince himself otherwise. \nAfter becoming aware of his classroom supervisor\'s obscure endeavours involving reality warping anomalies known as ""Bugs,"" Cinna begins to realize that, for better or worse, his life is about to change.\nAnd this time, he\'ll have no control over any of it.\'\nWow, this really puts into perspective how much worse the previous one was. I have much yet to learn I suppose!\nAnyway, do you consider the new one to be better?', ""I updated the description literally as soon as you posted your reply. Thanks for the tips and also for the compliments. \nIf you have feedback for the (hopefully) new and improved version, I'd appreciate it also!"", 'I like this one more than the other!', 'Much improved! Great job. =D', 'I think this is a really good start but you can tighten this up further. The phrase ""young individual"" are empty words and you want to use 2 or 3 very descriptive words in its place.  For example:\nSpoiler rich kidFootball all-starAmateur cage fighter Introverted physics nerd\nThose 3 words dramatically change the entire feel of your summary and as a reader sets an expectation for what I\'m in for. If this is hard it can also be an early red flag that your characters depth and personality might need some more development.\nI would also encourage you to reduce your summary by half again. As others have pointed out there\'s too much story based jargon that I don\'t need to know that I will discover as I read your story. If you can aim for 3 sentences, follow a format of:Set upEvent/actionConsequence and catalyst for your story \nThis way all your points are related to the general premise of your story as it relates to your characters journey. \nA quick example:Always dreaming of a better life, Cinna (3 words), is missing all the great things around him. But his whole world literally changes when he is involved in a science experiment that warps the very fabric of reality. Now his life is heading in a direction he never intended and it\'s out of his control. \nI may be way off the mark given the limited knowledge I have of your story but I hope it illustrates the point.\nSpend a lot of time refining your summary and pitch because it really is a compass for you as you develop your story.\nAll the best with it, I like your art, I think you\'re off to a great start.', ""Alright, I'll continue to work on it.Thanks."", 'I\'m going to give some rather unconventional advice to you when it comes to the back-of-the-book description that you seek. After all, if you were merely looking for an accurate plot summary, you wouldn\'t come asking us about it. I\'ll be covering just your most recent one, to keep things simple.\nKeep in mind, I\'ll intentionally be giving you a hard time, solely for the sake of making my points. You see, I, as your average reader, am a notorious sort of window shopper that has little patience for descriptions that don\'t really tell me much of meaning or do anything to interest me. \n""\'Cinna Annis is a young individual who should be content with his life.""  Wow, first sentence and I\'m already bored. \'Young individual\', is that the best you can do? This is your chance to tell the reader something they don\'t know that will possibly interest them. \'should be content with his life\' is a decent enough hook, I guess, but it\'s still fairly vague and you end up wasting that as well.\n""The truth is far from this however, no matter how much he tries to convince himself otherwise."" This would be more compelling if the setup to this was that \'he thinks he wasn\'t responsible for the orphanage burning down\', which would actually be a clever and meaningful form of characterization, but with your spike being as vague and not-that-interesting as it is, your serve is just more of the same... as in, it\'s boring.\n""After becoming aware of his classroom supervisor\'s obscure endeavours involving reality warping anomalies known as ""Bugs,"" ""  An improvement, but this could be phrased better. Like, what is the supervisor doing with the anomalies? Experimenting with them? Abusing them? Poking them with a stick? I understand the impulse to keep some cards hidden, but those will mean nothing if you can\'t get your reader in the door. There\'s a difference between giving just enough rope for them to hang themselves, and giving almost nothing to latch onto.\n""Cinna begins to realize that, for better or worse, his life is about to change."" UUUGGGHHH. YOU\'RE DOING IT AGAIN. \'his life is about to change\' sounds meaninglessly vague. I\'m sure you could phase it better so it doesn\'t sound so droll, like \'As he witnesses reality\'s rules being bent out of shape, Cinna realizes that life is about to get very interesting.\'  Further contextualization of past information and a semblance of actual tone at the same time, what a wonderful deal!\n""And this time, he\'ll have no control over any of it."" Without any further context, this doesn\'t tell us much, maybe that he\'s a muggle, I guess, even though that\'s kind of inferred? If this were a sequel this would make sense, but you never told us what happened \'last time\' so this line genuinely just feel meaningless. I\'m a bit of a sucker for one-liner zingers at the ends of descriptions myself, but this one just falls flat.\nBottom line: Structure doesn\'t matter that much, just get the reader interested and don\'t bore them. I\'ll take long, winding, and highly interesting over short, lean, and vague to the point of meaninglessness every day of the week.', ""Lots of great replies to my little query I see!Thanks for the info.Yeah.... as I'm sure everyone can tell by simply looking at my initial description, this is the first time I've ever written a plot description in my life.Oh well, practice makes perfect! And what better place to throw steaming failed attempts than into the endless abyss that is the internet!"", 'Well, here\'s version 4.0:\n""Living in the remote landscape of Loderfine, Cinna Annis believes that he possesses everything he could need to be happy. This is far from the truth however, because try as he might, he cannot escape the impulsive desires controlling his life.\nAfter becoming aware of his classroom supervisor\'s obscure endeavours involving reality warping anomalies known as ""Bugs,"" Cinna begins to realize that, for better or worse, his life is going to become quite a bit more complicated.\nAnd from now on, he\'ll have even less control over it than he did before.""\nI\'d like to once again thank all the people who have helped me refine it. If anyone still wants to take a crack at this thread with my latest description, then go ahead!', '""Living in the remote landscape of Loderfine,""Better, but I still don\'t quite like how vague the description here is. \'Remote\', is that meant to be rural? Or out in the jungles away from civilization? Or on a goddamn island? Perhaps somewhere out in the desert that\'s far from the coastal cities of Africa? Now I at least have a ballpark, but it\'s still too wide. And don\'t even get me started on \'landscape\', since that could be basically anything. You could be describing anywhere from some random no-name town in Arizona to the North Pole itself to the Okinawan islands, and I have no way of discerning which one it is.\n""Cinna Annis believes that he possesses everything he could need to be happy. This is far from the truth however, because try as he might, he cannot escape the impulsive desires controlling his life."" You\'re doing it. Again. But, this time I think I see one of the big problems, being that this segment is needlessly wordy. REWRITE TIME!\'Cinna Annis believes he has everything he could need to be happy, yet the impulsive desires controlling his life deny him even that much satisfaction."" This is still vague, but at least it wastes less time, which is a plus\n"".After becoming aware of his classroom supervisor\'s obscure endeavours involving reality warping anomalies known as ""Bugs,"""" Completely unchanged relative to before, I see. I think you\'d benefit massively from telling us what kind of things these anomalies can do. Can I expect things like from the Stalker series? Perhaps the SCP foundation? Can I expect time travel portals, non-Euclidean geometry like The Backrooms, or is this man about to summon Cthulhu on accident? Normally getting me to question like this is good, but since \'obscure endeavors\' is so goddamned vague I stop caring because I\'m uninvested and can\'t make heads or tails of what connotation I should look at this with. I have no clue what kind of story to expect, and I still hate it.\n""Cinna begins to realize that, for better or worse, his life is going to become quite a bit more complicated."" Better, but still a bit more vague than it should be. This line in itself would be more compelling if Cinna materially is established as having something to lose due to his life becoming more \'complicated\'. He\'s not keeping up a facade, nor does he already have several platters to spin in an already busy life working a 9 to 5 or anything. In fact, as far as the description tells me, Cinna kinda comes off as an apathetic dude with no real motive. In fact, \'the impulsive desires\' isn\'t even specific enough if you\'re just trying to tell me fate or luck is doing the dude wrong in an unnecessarily obtuse/verbose way or if he has some actual baggage he\'s fighting, and the more brainpower I have to spend on just assessing what the hell you mean the less interested I become.\n""And from now on, he\'ll have even less control over it than he did before."" This implies that there even was a last time he had anomalies in his life. If you told us he\'s dealt with these things before and thought he sealed the can of evil once and for all before pissing off to retire in the mountains or something, this would make more sense, it\'d actually tell me something meaningful about the character and stand a snowball\'s chance in hell of holding my interest, but as-is it\'s not being correlated well with anything else. Are we implying Cinna had no control of his life before, as it is? Because \'having everything he needs to be happy\' is directly contradicting that.\nAs a whole, it feels like you don\'t know what kind of story you really want this to be, can\'t pick a good direction. I can see that as being immensely frustrating for potential readers trying to figure out what they\'re getting themselves into.']",4/2/2021 14:15,https://forums.tapas.io/t/thoughts-on-my-plot-description/57024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,Review request for Secret Challenge,Reviews | Feedback,[],"The first episode of Secret Challenge is up and ready for you to read.

This is an action adventure that follows two special ops veterans as they fight to complete a tough reality show challenge.  See if they can win out and get the prize.  
https://tapas.io/episode/21266488","['Since you wanted it, here it is:\nFirst of all, it\'s stated from the start that these guys are supposed to be some sort of ex-special forces hardasses, but they really don\'t act like it. Like, at all. If they were really leaning so hard into their training they wouldn\'t bother doing obvious shit like warning each other that the fountain water\'s not safe, or having to make plans on the fly to the extent that they do. For normal soldiers that would honestly be excusable, but if you knew the first thing about special forces you\'d know that those guys go nuts for planning missions out. Given that they\'re even participating, they probably care enough about winning to take it seriously. Their general dialogue also just doesn\'t really feel at all like how special forces would speak, retired or not. I feel as if you\'d get a lot more leeway for yourself if you retconned them to just be retired veterans—maybe look into marine scout snipers for some ideas. If the utility of the dialogue is to explain a few things to the reader, you\'d be better off with normal narration.\nThe whole taking the glasses off thing seems like it could become a pretty serious plothole if left unchecked, but since it\'s the first day of the challenge I guess it can be excused.\nAbout the AR-15 thing. First of all, why would they even bother? As far as the audience knows, they\'re supposed to just get across existing civilian territory with highly limited resources, and law and order is still clearly in play. The second someone hears them shooting that damn thing, they\'re pretty much fucked on principle due to the cops that it\'ll draw. Even if it\'s suppressed, leaving bodies behind is also going to get the cops involved sooner or later. And honestly? Why would they bring the damn thing to begin with? There\'s not going to be many enemies to shoot, they\'re civilians in friendly territory. Unless, of course, there\'s a group of hunters that the cops ALSO don\'t know about, which just raises a ton of questions about the challenge itself(that I\'m sure will be explained in due time, to be fair!).\nWhat left me more dumbfounded, however, was the rifle being described as a ""Collapsible AR-15"". While it\'s true that collapsible stocks are a common feature on these rifles, the phrasing seems to describe the whole rifle as collapsible which doesn\'t actually exist, as far as I know. A collapsible stock would also not add much to the portability of such a rifle. Folding AR-15s exist, but that\'s not what\'s described here(unless that\'s what you meant to say? Still poor phrasing, though).']",4/19/2021 9:46,https://forums.tapas.io/t/review-request-for-secret-challenge/57612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,Seeking some advice!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"_Hi all, _
I have just started writing my first novel & I was wondering if someone could just read my synopsis and give me some advice, I know it is early but I'm curious what others thoughts are.

I’m done with reincarnation, this time I’ll become a different type of God.
Death does not mean the end, with technological advancements that escape the realm of reality scientists have made a new plain of existence, by a process called upload. By uploading one’s brain upon death, humans can recall all their history of being alive and are free to choose what they would like to do with their afterlife within Eden, an artificial intelligent graveyard where you choose your own world & explore as you see fit.
Within Eden you can become anything you desire from a celestial being controlling the world and its inhabitants or a peasant farmer tending to his garden, the choice is yours and if you die, you’ll simply restart and choose your next destination.
But what happens when bonds are made with the advanced AI avatars that are human in everyway, but aren't immortal, what happens to the psychological baggage of endless cycles of birth and death, how do you escape this never-ending loop.
Do you become a god, watching over your Eden alone?
Or do you simply keep restarting & hope your next world is more favorable & that the advanced AI doesn’t create another scenario where your loved ones die horrifically?
""No, not again! Eden, upload protocol decision made. I wish to try something a little different, I want to become a god again with some minor alterations.”

Thanks for reading, any input would be golden as I'm a total noob. ","[""The plot isn't really explained and conflict is ambiguous as well. What genre is the novel, who are the characters, what is happening? You don't have to go in depth when answering these questions, but they should be addressed. This reads less like a synopsis and more like a section from the novel. I recommend looking for other synopses and see how other authors handle them. One thing to note is that a blurb, with is usually on the inside of a physical book, and a synopsis are separate things. When writing a synopsis, it's alright to include the ending of the story."", ""Ah understood, I suppose this does sound more like a passage from the inside of the novel rather then what the novel is about.\nI haven't actually gotten that far into it yet, this is how my mind works when I came up with the idea & just went with it, I haven't world built anything yet, I was more curious what people thought about premise but I suppose I'm not even there yet \nThank you for reality checking me early on !"", ""Yea, it seems like an interesting story concept and it'll be cool to see where you take it."", 'Ah, thank you I will try to world build tomorrow and hopefully make a concept chapter ', 'Interesting though I\'m not even sure I understood it all.  \nWhether that\'s labeled a synopsis or not is kinda irrelevant. It explains your ideas.\nPerhaps something to consider for your story: In some immortality stories, the question comes up: how many lives of memories can a mind hold before something gives? Do memories have to be edited to permit brains to function properly?\nIf your recycled souls can ""choose your own world & explore as you see fit"" how much is randomly inserted into their chosen world/life or do they get boring because nothing is able to exceed one\'s imagination?\nEDIT: Just thought of this... who operates & maintains the AI Eden and why? Do they have motives for the effort? What do they get out of it all? ', ""As some others already mentioned, this reads like a part of the novel itself. I guess to a great degree because it reads like an internal dialogue of a complex character.That is not necessarily a bad thing.\nBut in this case it leads to very long sentences with a lot of complex and setting specific words or phrases.I would suggest making the sentences a lot shorter.\nThis part here for example, already has separate questions in it.

It's been a little over half a year since I picked up drawing. I did it out of necessity. I'm not looking to become an artist, only decent enough so I can portray a story or a meme. I've learned to enjoy it.

","['Originally I actually wanted to answer ""no"", imho it\'s too simplistic for a non gag-a-day comic. But then I watched closely... and I don\'t hate it. Would I read a comic that is drawn like this? I am not sure, in the end I do like pretty complicated artworks and minimalistic comics are not quite my thing. But I really think you are doing nice work with it, especially considering you barely started drawing last year, you are using it as a solid artstyle and it definitely looks like you know what you are going for.If you would allow an opinion, I\'d say the style of character\'s legs and arms are really in dissonance and I dunno about other readers, but it drives me mad ', ""Haha! thanks! Style is a very bad ripoff of Oxygen Not Included. \nReally needed to learn how to draw and I needed to know now! \nI won't show how the first page ever looked like.

And at least for me, it offers glimmers of hope here and there (or at least more room for softer moments).\nThat's what I'm hoping for. Even If I had the skills to draw gritty and noir I don't think I would have for this story. \nBecause, oh boy..."", ""Generally the rule of thumb I go by with very simplistic styles is thus: does the artist take advantage of the simplicity to have more expressive positions?\nAnd the answer here is a resounding yes, so yeah, I'd super read something in this style."", ""That's very high praise.\nI'll go back to tutorials so I can do it better and not disappoint!\nNo, really! Thank you."", ""I'd say yes, though I think it needs some refinement. In my opinion, this style usually seems to work best with cleaner lines, or intentionally messy lines. I'd say experiment more with colors and textures, line thickness, and clean up your text and bubbles. Maybe consider only using fonts instead of handwriting sound fx. The faces and style are nice and I think it definitely works. \nIf you want to see other examples of a simplistic fun style, check out the Invader Zim comics.

(tho you got that feedback already :D) \nwhat @artamazon said about the colors and cleanness for more reduced comics, I would, for Personal Taste (which I held back in the feedback thread) completely agree with. I love it, personally, when a stylized and blobby line art and character designs, will also use a stylized and simplified approach to the colors and stuff. it just really takes advantage of the style-genre then :D.but that is my personal taste ( I know I keep repeating it, but I do want it to be clear lol if you want to stick to texturing etc, there's also a lot of room to improve in that direction no doubt.)"", ""Thanks again Skull Noir, you're great!

I did take your advice to heart and I feel like I should do something in return."", ""I think this is great for starting out and you shouldn't stress out too much about it!\nI will add that when you do a blobby style, your line quality matters so much more because there's less lines to rely on. There is an inconsistency between how much love you give to the characters vs what you give to your environment (which is normal, we do less for the environments in comics) but the lineart in the backgrounds don't necessarily feel like a different style, they just feel like they were hard to draw (and so kudos on doing it, backgrounds are hard) and are not yet finished.\nThat and the colors are dark. Because Tapas puts this white background on every page, all of our dark comics are now that much harder to see. So, I'd pull that saturation and lightness up so we can see more midtones.""]",4/16/2021 11:44,https://forums.tapas.io/t/poll-do-you-like-this-style/57637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The yellow-striped bus squeaked and groaned to a stop. Heather stole one glance at the city limits of Denver and pushed deeper into the bus terminal.
“Heather!” called a voice from behind her. “Heather! Baby! Wait up!”
She groaned and turned to face the tall man jogging towards her in the crowd. “What is it, Kyle!?”
Kyle pulled out the folded piece of paper from his pants pocket. “What the hell is this, Hettie? You’re breaking up with me over a friggin’ note!”
“I NEED SPACE!” Heather shouted, stamping her feet. A few passersby looked at the former couple argue with muted interest.
“SPACE!” Kyle retorted. “You didn’t seem to need space when you agreed to marry me two weeks ago!”
A garbled voice over the speaker announced the recent arrivals and departures. Heather ran her fingers through her chin-length hair. 
“Kyle,” her voice broke. “The course of true love never did run smooth.”
He cursed under his breath. Heather had always joked during their undergraduate years that Shakespeare was her one true love. “Why are you quoting Shakespeare? Hettie… Let’s go home and talk about this.”
Heather shook her head. “Parting is such sweet sorrow.” And with that, she turned on her heel and followed a crowd to the bus.
“HEATHER! WAIT!”

And now for part 2.

Tony Jarrett loosened the knot of his grey speckled necktie as he went into this office. Two couples, they were four kids really, had been found fifteen miles outside of the city. No one knew who these kids were or what they were doing in the middle of the desert, but his office had a good idea as to why – The Rising Moon Ranch.
There were several theories bouncing around the district attorney’s office about what went on behind those cinder block walls. Tony had heard that they were everything from hippies to Bible-thumpers to sun-worshipping lizard people. The “why” wasn’t too important to him anymore. There were four young people too many in the county morgue, and he was going to do everything he could to stop there from being a fifth.
“Jill,” he called to his secretary of three years. “Hold all my calls. I’ll be reviewing the Rising Moon case files again."" He turned to another assistant. ""Mike, get me a cup of coffee, ‘kay? Thanks.”
“Hello Mr. Jarrett,” said Dr. Woodhouse said calmly. “Please close the door.”
Tony eyed the woman sitting in his desk chair suspiciously as he closed his office door behind him. “Who are you and what the hell are you doing in my office?”
Dr. Woodhouse gestured to the empty chair across from her. “Please take a seat.”
“I’ll stand, thanks.” Tony studied the two men who stood on either side of the intruder. “Look lady,” he declared. “I don’t know who you or your goons are, but you have thirty seconds to explain what you are doing in my office or I will call the police.”
Neither Dr. Woodhouse or her two associates moved. Tony grumbled under his breath as he looked at his wristwatch. “Twenty seconds… Ten seconds… Fine,” he crossed to his desk and reached for the phone. “I’m calling the police.” Before he could reach the phone, one of the men snapped and wrapped Tony’s wrist. Yellow-green scales appeared on the other man’s tan skin. “What the…”
“Mr. Reynolds,” Dr. Woodhouse soothed. “Let him go.” Mr. Reynolds released his hold on Tony’s wrist. “Now, District Attorney Jarrett, I do believe that we have some business to discuss.”
Tony tried to rub away the red triangle indentations left behind Mr. Reynolds. “What business? Who are you?”
Dr. Woodhouse picked up a case file from his desk and started to skim through the pages. “I’m here to offer my assistance with our mutual problem – the killings at Rising Moon Ranch.”

","['Not bad, but these two passages in tandem would constitute a bit of a genre crisis, though that could be resolved by a good book description/synopsis. They just feel very discordant when put together in terms of both the tone of the story and the type of story being told.\nBoth do a fairly good job of not telling the reader everything, but just enough to get the reader to begin asking questions. I don\'t think they\'re perfect; the prose could use some refinements to become more flavorful and I\'m not sure why the lady waited in passage 2 for Tony to go for the phone before explaining herself, though there are worse ways to show that her henchmen are not exactly human—I thought that\'s a pretty good little hint, myself!\nIf you\'re in the mood to compare notes, my Chapter 0 (Lament) is a relatively short opener that uses many similar tricks to acquire and hold the reader\'s interest, and I think I do it a little better(though you\'re free to disagree).\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nUrban Wolf: On The Run | Tapas\n""Death set me free, but then it rejected me like a high school crush way out of my league.""\n\nA swordmaster flees from her hometown and to the illustrious city of Halych, leaving behind a history of sorrow and pain to find better people and claim a...\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""The second section hooks me faster than the first section does. Knowing your writing and The Museum and the switch of scenes I have no problem. I would, however, put the second section first, although... that's me and you've already got established readers who are familiar with your writing rhythm. It's just that the second section grabs. Then, the first section makes you think... is this one of the couples.\nHowever, I don't know how that relates to the rest of the story so I would say I stand a 50/50 chance of having that switching idea sent to file 13 quickly.\nVisually I see it though in my minds eye, the pages flipping over, the bus rolling in, the argument, the bus rolling out. \nYup, for me that would be a faster hook."", 'Thank you for your feedback. I am curious if you have any specific examples of sentences or phrases that do not make sense or were not clear. While writing styles vary, my aim is to use sensory details to create an image in your mind while avoiding phrases or sayings that might be unclear to readers.\nIf you are interested in reading more about my world, you are more than welcome to check out my series.', '\n\nMShadowlawn:\nand I think I do it a little better(\nDude, I hope that\'s said as a funny haha, wink wink, nudge nudge, ""let\'s all have a laugh"" way. We don\'t play that way around here telling people our work is better than theirs. We\'re here to help if we can.', 'The first section is for a potential subplot involving a potential ""victim""/ real connection to the case but I\'m not sure when to introduce that subplot. Time will tell!', 'I\'m not talking about things that ""didn\'t make sense"" or ""aren\'t clear""; when I said ""More flavorful"" I meant that the prose could\'ve been expressed in a way that makes it feel more interesting, something to bolster the reader\'s interest until they get more invested in the story. I\'m fairly guilty myself of taking straightforward paths to convey information I want to convey, but if the information is conveyed with an interesting tone or twist, that can be a form of entertainment in itself.\nAn example about buying strips of tape at the postal store:""It sucks spending so much on a single strip of tape, but I don\'t like taking risks."", compared to""The price I was paying for a single strip felt like highway robbery, but I have to be sure to get this right.""Probably a bad example, since it\'s monologue instead of prose description, but I hope that gets the general idea across.\nThis entire criticism is mostly aimed at the first passage, by the way.', ""I understand where you're coming from here(Nobody likes arrogant bastards, after all), but you need to chill.I stated my opinion as an opinion, knowing full well that there are people who have said that my opening chapter/passage is too confusing for its own good and some people would likely prefer these passages to my own. I'd also like to point out that...\n\nThis is a passage to passage comparison instead of me standing atop a mountain beating my chest about my work as a whole being far superior to anyone else's.\nI stated that I thought I did better at simply intriguing the reader within that passage, rather than any of the other purposes an opening chapter can fulfill, such as setting a tone, establishing a plot, or setting expectations.\n\nI sometimes read the work of other authors to learn certain tricks from them and ultimately improve my own writing. If I read a Dresden Files book and decide to take some notes about cool prose tricks, that's not me submitting to Jim Butcher being a definitively better writer than I am overall or that book being definitively better than mine across the board. I offered that passage as a case study and an example that I thought was helpful, and they could take it or leave it as they wished."", 'I see. Thank you for the clarification. We may have to agree to disagree since the first section is taken without context and our writing styles differ. With my style, I try to avoid the ""more flavorful"", as you put it, expressions because they can detract from the story in general. Sensory images such as ""the briney scent of old hot dogs tickled her nose"", help paint the picture of where the character is at.\nWith your example, (given it\'s out of context) based on the speech pattern, I know nothing about the character but I would assume they are younger. I would revamp the phrase to be something like, ""I counted my money again. I should have just enough to buy the tape and maybe a few stamps. The money could be better spent on other things but it would be worth it to see Jenny smile."" If I structure the rest of the story right, it will do its job holding readers attention.\nThanks again for the clarification.', ""Here is another section (different story) that I'd like some thoughts one.\n\n“Can I come in?” Johnathan asked, rapping on the doorframe of Jamie’s workshop. Jamie looked up from the antique clock she was working on, in surprise. “I thought you’d be going through your bead bucket again. I remember you had said that they help you focus.”\n“Oh yeah,” Jamie agreed. She looked at the tote of colored beads on the shelf. “I was, but Old Jeffrey was asking for some attention.”\nThe corner of Johnathan’s mouth lifted into a half-smile. “Old Jeffery?”\n“Uh-huh,” Jamie picked up a key from the workbench and inserted it into the clock casing. “Watch this.” \nShe turned key. The brass clock hands started to spin faster and faster, as the clock’s mother of pearl face fell apart. The clock’s churning parts shifted into an owl. \n“Remember that case we had in Germany, at the clock shop?” she asked. Johnathan nodded. Jeffrey the Owl’s mechanical eyes blinked lovingly at Jamie. “I brought Jeffrey home with me. He was a little beat up, but he’s doing much better now.”\nA holographic bubble appeared over Jamie’s cuff. “Another case?”\n“Yeah,” Johnathan confirmed. “They sent me to come and get you.”\nJamie’s shoulders slumped as she set the mechanical owl back on the workbench. “Let’s go save the world, again.”\n"", 'Just to pipe in to the earlyer discussion, i quite like your overall style. I think it reads grounded even with a fantastical touch in the story/setting itself.\nJust because i am late here i have one more point for the first section with the couple. You said it would be set deeper inside a story, so this might be irelevant, but I am kind of missing the hook itself. Its two people in a difficult relationship but beides, the vague question of ""will they, won\'t they"" there is no explicit hook.Maybe hint on the reason why the girl has this feelings? \nAnd for the new paragraph:I still like the style and am more concerned with the content.First of, the part with the marble bucket is confusing and feels like it doesn\'t really add to this scene in the moment. Can\'t they get directly to the clock? But maybe the confusion is the point here? I can\'t look into your head.And secondly I am missing a fitting framing. There is no description of the space they are in and that is normaly not a big problem, if the dialogue is the hook. But in this case you do establish a sci-fi element later on, and for me this comes comepletely out of the blue. Before that the hint on the setting was the old clock. It makes a great contrast to the sci-fi feel, but I feel like the order in which it is shown is more confusing than a pleasant mix.Maybe start by describing a high-tech workshop in which this old clock sticks out.And again, maybe the sudden shift is the goal here. \nSry for the long ramble, hope this helps ', 'Thanks for the feedback! I knew I could and probably should have given some framing for each section but I wanted a general reaction for each bit.\nPart 1: This is the scene I am ""toying"" with. My series is very episodic in nature. One thing I do periodically is start the story with a ""scene"" from the POV of a potential victim like you see in crime procedurals. Sometimes the opening scene with ties to the case is stronger than others. \nWith the new part (different story than the first). I\'ll give some framing now with the moment before. Before this scene, Jamie had a fight with another character. When she\'s upset, she obsessively organizes the bead bucket. So everyone is assuming, because of the fight, that\'s what she\'d be working on.\n*With the description part, I want to say it\'s stylistic!  The dream is for my series to be a TV show, so you\'d see the sci-fi/steampunk aesthetic going on in my head. The room is partially described in another story with ""piles of clutter everywhere"". So in my head, her shop is one of those ""holes"" filled with papers and tools and items in various stages of repair. \nPart of my issue with description is that I don\'t want to stop the action to describe a person\'s outfit or a specific detail of a room unless absolutely necessary. There are some conclusions that I think are logical like dressing in workout clothes when exercising or old clothes when doing something messy. However, since this story is in rewrites, if I can find a logical moment to go back to her shop I will try to add more detail.']",4/14/2021 17:54,https://forums.tapas.io/t/will-you-review-this-please-i-need-feedback/57558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

138,First Finished Artwork,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey everyone I just finished my first ever digital Artwork. I previously did a trial for a linework drawing but I made a lot of mistakes and got a lot of good advice here so I took them into consideration and made my first ever full coloured drawing.Once again I hope for a lot of constructive criticism and tips on what I could do better.Especially on the shading since this is my first time ever shading anything except for maybe that one time in high school during art class that I don'T really remember. ( I used a tutorial by David Revoy for the basic shading technics in Krita)
The program used was Kita

Hope you enjoy drawing in the future!\nAs for critique, are there any specific components you'd like focused on for improving your digital art?"", 'I think my biggest trouble is shading but honestly, any critique can help because I really want to get better and improve.', 'Not an artist here, but all I can say is that it looks good from a first try!', ""This looks really good!But you ask for constructive criticism so I will provide. Just keep in mind that a lit of it is nitpicking and you don't have to take any of the advice if you don't like it. \nAight, here we go.\nSo the first thing is color choices. While they aren't bad, they could improve a lot when you consider the atmospheric lighting! It's a sunset, so the colors will be a bit less saturated (that's actually always a good first step, esp reds blues and yellows. Less is more, having them on full saturation, makes them clash easily) and a bit more tinted so they are warm.Yellow is not a warm color, but neutral. So to get it warm, it needs to lean a bit in the orange direction. \n\nThe shading itself is placed well, but it blurrs a lot.While it's true that there's a lot of soft shadows, esp in an artwork with heavy lines, the kind of airbrushing quickly looks out of place. Consider if you want to do painting or flat shading. They both have different strengths and need different line art!\nGive hard shadows a go if you want, by coloring everything in solidly, and then make selections for where the colors need to go, and bucket tool fill them in. Having them a bit bigger and more defined will probably help, rather than having, like on the sleeve of the coat, a long strip of darker blur. \nThe shadow colors so far seem fine to me.\nWhat also stands out is, that you are inconsistent with the shading. . There's some parts you haven't shaded at all, like his hair and right hand, also some of the folds on the yellow top look unshaded. \n\nIf you want I can practically show you my suggestions on the artwork, but that's pretty intrusive, so it's completely up to you if you think that would help you or annoy you. If yes, feel free to @ me the image without the shading and I'll do a quick thing"", 'This is looking good for a first piece!\nThe main area I\'d suggest looking at your pen/brush smoothing. The lines look a little ""floppy"" and they\'re tapering off a bit early leading to gappy lines that make the figures feel a bit soft and lacking in depth and volume. Try lowering the line smoothing a bit, or only turn it up when you need to ink bigger curves, and play around with the settings for where it tapers off.', ""@Yulek First of all thank you very much for the feedback. Since I asked for criticism this is really helpful and I do see the things you pointed out myself now that they got pointed out. The only thing I would have to say was that the idea behind the background was more of a fire nature than a sunset so I did intentionally chose a rather saturated shading colour. But as I said I don'T really know much about shading and stuff so everything you pointed out is a lot of help to me.As for the rest, I have no idea what the difference between flat of paint shading is since I just followed along with the tutorial I found and it only used a paintbrush and an airbrush. I will definitely look into that topic a little more.One last thing I had a lot of trouble with was the dark green robe since originally it was supposed to be black but I didn't know how to make it black without losing the line art since they would be the same colour.I will attached the picture iwthout shading to see what I can differntly:\nsecond try no shading.jpg2000x1200 644 KB\n\nThank you for your advice"", ""Thank you for your advice I will take that into consideration.

Gappy lines can be hard to use effectively! It sounds like you understand where you need to change things up though. Play around with your pen settings and try doing some studies to recreate an artist you like's style as closely as you can to reverse-engineer their approach. "", 'so basically, I made the shadows ""bigger"".. esp since you have a light source behind the characters, there would be a lot more shadow as well the colors are all darker, desaturated and closer together esp the yellow and the skin tones.. even if the character is super pale, in a scene with natural light, they wont be that bight. same with the yellow. if you put in someone in a white shirt, their shirt would be colored with not pure white either. same principle. \nthings that are ""bhind"" another thing are usually more shadowed to just give a visual key to the viewer that those things aren\'t on the same plane... like her legs. the one in the back doesn\'t even need to be especially detailed, but making it a shade darker usually works great \nfiguting out a rough light direction beforehand usually is a good. I wasn\'t super consequent here myself, or the guys face would have been more in the shadows as well\nI think that was pretty much it. but hmu if you have any follow up questions. \nalso this is just one way to do this, not THE way.

After the Crown Prince suddenly annuls their engagement, Neve Rosentine is sent to die in the frontlines of war. To everyone's surprise, Neve rises in rank and leads the military alongside her newfound ally: the bastard Prince Hale. But things are...





","[""Read through the chapters!\nThe premise is vey intriguing, and if you'll pardon my language, pretty kickass! The writing style suits it perfectly, I really feel like I'm in the shoes of the protagonist and everything is given just the right amount of detail. I was going to complain that the tipping point of the story seemed a bit forced, but then it was explained that it's the Queen pulling the strings and it all made perfect sense. I was legitimately angered by the kangaroo court given to Neve.\nI only have a few notes:The reveal that Neve has extensive combat training felt a little exposition dump-y, just a little too tell rather than show, but it wasn't a huge problem. There were also a few moments where background information was dropped in a way that felt a little unprompted throughout, but it didn't stand out enough to really be a distraction.\nOverall I found your story very interesting, effectively written and enjoyable to read!\nHere's my novel if you want to take a look:\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nPost-Apocalyptic Introductions | Tapas\nFive egotistical survivors of a devastating apocalypse sit around a fire and introduce themselves and tell the stories of their lives to a mysterious stranger. (heavy swearing)\nTRIGGER WARNING: This story can be depressing, contains broken people...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""I read through the first two episodes. This isn't the usual type of story I would read so my opinion may vary from others. I had a hard time getting through the first episode. I thought it was too long and drawn out without enough action taking place. In fact, I almost ended up quitting, but I pushed myself through so that I could leave you a review. You finally caught my attention at the very end of the first episode, which is good, but you almost lost me before I even got there. Moving into the second episode, I enjoyed the story a bit more. This is the point that I ended up subscribing to your story. I still feel that it was slow and didn't move fast enough, but I do understand that this is still the beginning of her adventures.I would recommend finding a way to make the first episode a little less boring, because if readers are like me, they would have never finished that first episode. Like I said, I only continued to give you a review, so if I was just browsing for new reading material, I would have left.With all this being said, you have very good grammar and sentence structure, which I always appreciate in a story. You have good flow and obviously know how to move between thoughts, which makes the story easier to read. \nThis is my novel. It's a fantasy bl, so if it's not your cup of tea don't worry about reading it and reviewing it\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nMissing Pieces | Tapas\nFelix woke up in the hospital not knowing who or where he was. There was a lot of mystery clouding him, and nobody knew how to answer the impossible questions that everyone wanted to know: who was he and where did he come from? Unable to recall his...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'First of all, let me start by stating the obvious: your art is gorgeous!\nTo go off what\'s already been said, I agree that the reveal about Neve\'s training was a bit ""I\'ll have you know that..."", but completely disagree about the first episode being too boring. It might not be full of action, but there\'s tension and a hint of mystery, since something that was clearly not meant to happen did and that drew me in. \nGoing from Neve\'s to Vale\'s POV mid-episode might upset some people, however, as a lot of folks subscribe to the idea that POV changes should be kept to episode / scene breaks. \nOverall, I liked it! It\'s not my usual type of read, but I enjoyed it, it\'s interesting, the writing is tight and flows well and I don\'t see any major flaws other than the two minor things I pointed out. I think you\'ll do well with fans of the genre!\nHere\'s mine, if you want to give it a go:\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nAt the End of the World | Tapas\nHumanity set out to attain Godhood and failed. \n\nIn the ruins left by their attempt, imprisoned in the throes of undeath, their heirs hide from the demons, horrors of the mind reborn as horrors of the world, and the angels, servants of the God they...\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Here Is Mine I Hope You Like It Also Imma look At yours!The Unnoticed Child', 'Thanks for all the detail! I agree there was a lot of (maybe needless) exposition. I struggle with alternating between plot and exposition, especially when writing fantasy due to all of the worldbuilding. \nHere\'s my review of your novel. I read up to Chapter 10.\nThe premise of the novel is really interesting! You\'ve got a great ensemble cast that\'s diverse and flawed enough to feel real. You\'ve also strongly committed to the ""campfire conversation"" format. There isn\'t a huge rush to provide exposition. The reader really is plopped into the middle of their conversation. I also love that it\'s almost interactive; the theories in the comments about the characters added an extra dimension to the story. \nI would suggest more action and description to break up dialogue, especially some of the longer pieces of dialogue. This would improve the flow of the story, set a slower pace, and help the reader better visualize the scene. However, you did start to include more descriptive writing in Chapter 7 and beyond. \nLastly, I would just say to be mindful of grammar/proper dialogue punctuation. For example, this sentence:\n""So I was living my hollow-easter-egg-life."" Agony went on, ""Pretending to love my husband, pretending to love my job, and actually loving my side job.""\nfollowing proper syntax would be changed to:\n""So I was living my hollow-Easter-egg-life,"" Agony went on, ""pretending to love my husband, pretending to love my job, and actually loving my side job.""\nThanks again for taking the time to review my novel ', ""Thanks! Yeah my grammar needs a lot of work, and I'm really happy to get good critique right now since I'm working on writing part 2!"", 'No problem! Honestly I have no idea how this website works, but just message me if you want to do a back-and-forth sometime.', 'Hey, thanks for your review! I was unsure about the first chapter since I did wait until the end to reveal the true twist. Isekai webcomics and webnovels are my guilty pleasure, but I dislike how dramatic and historically inaccurate they tend to be. My intention with my novel was to make it a bit more realistic (and thus slower paced), though it may be boring for people who don\'t normally read historical fantasy.\nHere\'s my review. I read up to Chapter One .5\nYour story has an interesting premise. Chapter One .1 definitely left me wanting to know more about Felix, his roommate, and how they ended up in that living situation. However, there was a lot of information given to the reader in the first segments of the first chapter. You\'re working with a very complicated plot, so I would have appreciated a slower initiation into Felix\'s background and his relationship with Max.\nAs a technical note, I noticed you have some very long paragraphs. Long paragraphs tend to tire me out as a reader, and on mobile they look especially large. There are points where paragraphs can naturally be broken, like starting a new thought, a new action occurring, or a change in location.\nFor example, in Chapter One .4:\n...he\'d let me do as I pleased as long as I followed the rules. Once in the backyard, I layed (sic) down in the grass area..."" \nPersonally, I would\'ve started a new paragraph at ""Once in the backyard..."" \nAlso just a sidenote, when I read ""Detective Karl and Max"" I thought it said Detective Karl Marx haha\nThanks again for reading and reviewing ', ""Thanks for the review. I'll definitely go back and work on spacing out the paragraphs in the beginning on my story."", ""Hi, thanks for reviewing!\nI'm glad you like my art! I do want to make a webcomic one day, but I don't have much time and I am the world's slowest artist.\nI see there really is an issue with revealing Neve's martial training  Unfortunately it is important information, which I'm using to justify why her family isn't even more panicked about Neve being sent to war. I'll see if there's a way I can introduce this information in a later chapter, or rework it somehow...\nI also didn't even realize the issue with the POV shift. I don't think there's enough content to warrant a new chapter, but I'll definitely add a spacer to indicate the shift. Thanks for pointing that out!\nHere's my review. I read all of 'How the Bells Toll.'\nWhat an incredible world you've built! You've included so many little details that immediately immersed me in your story. Great use of diction and description. The last two sentences of Day 1.1 were SO GOOD! I don't have much to say plot-wise other than that you've crafted a very captivating story. \nYour paragraphs do run a little long, though. As I mentioned in my previous review, try to find natural breaks in a paragraph as to not overwhelm the reader. Action sequences especially benefit from shorter paragraphs, as they indicate a faster pace. \nFor example, if I were to rewrite passage from 1.3, I would write it like this:\n\nThe result is immediate. With a simple ghost of a thought that is more emotional desire than rational process, the red and black lace dress materializes. The corset and armour follow suit.\nA bouquet of roses sprouts from the back of her dress...\nA red veil cascades down her back to cover her hair...\n\nHowever, that's a fairly minor and technical critique. Overall, a beautiful story. Can't wait to read more!"", ""Oof, I feel you on the world's slowest artist part haha! With your art I'm actually happy to see you wrote a novel. \nI'm already having a soft spot for Vale, he reminds me of my own character who happens to be  duke. XD I'm loving Neve's character. I think I might be too biased as I feel happy reading a story whilst writing one that might have similar elements.\nAs a non-native speaker, I love your build-up. I was able to get drawn in the story and feel along Neve's frustration in the first chapter. I like how eloquent the characters speak, I'm so weak for that haha. I felt so bad for Neve when she was basically pushed onto the battlefield, as if she could hold no more place in the court. It might not have been banishment but uh....oh lord. Poor thing.\nI think I agree with an earlier post regarding Neve's combat training. Let me see and experience it slowly, feeling the strength and skill of this character. I do not need a background beforehand per se, but I get where it might stem from. \nThis is my novel Jade Kingdoms, I hope it will be fun. \n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nJade Kingdoms | Tapas\nSince the bygone Age of Mirthless Synergy, the Sentient Mind was gifted by the galactic serpent Vritra to the mortal coil to give it its intelligence. Upon seeing its misuse, Vritra took back His gift and caused life to collapse. Now, a 100.000 years...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'I agree that it\'s important to place it there, to show why she, especially, is all ""meh, I\'ll just go to war, I guess"". But a simple mention of her having been trained, and then getting more into it later would work out better, I think!\nThank you, I\'m glad you enjoyed it! I do have a problem with long sentences and paragraphs that I\'ve been trying to work on (and it used to be way worse!), so I\'ll keep looking out for it and reworking some stuff! Again, thanks for the review!', ""Thanks for your review!\nI'm glad you enjoyed the build-up! I am very privileged in that my dad is an English teacher...let's just say grammar is VERY important to him.\nHere's my review. I read all of 'Ring of Rancor.'\nFirstly, I definitely do the see the similarities in our stories, though your novel leans a lot more heavily into the fantasy genre. You've got an awesome and complex magic system that's so unique! I can tell how much thought you've put into building this world. Your descriptive writing is spot on; it evokes a lot of imagery. \nI will say that Part I had a lot of information right off the bat, and at times I felt it difficult to wrap my head around. The description/exposition sometimes took me away from the present. But by the end of 'Ring of Rancor,' I had a pretty good grasp of the magic system. I'm sure all the new information becomes easier to digest throughout the chapters. \nAlso, not so much story related, but I love your use of colour! \nThanks again for reading and reviewing! Message me directly if you ever want to do chapter critiques. Our stories share some similarities so I think it would be helpful for both of us ""]",4/13/2021 11:54,https://forums.tapas.io/t/review-my-webnovel-and-ill-review-yours/57494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I normally read how many chapters you read of mines, and right now I only have 6 chapters, so I will only read about 6 chapters into yours, unless I genuinely enjoy it. In case, I'll be subscribing to it and reading it in my free time! 
Let's continue to help each other out guys  Thanks in advance, I appreciate it!","['Sunday is my feedback day, I can add you on my list.My novel : \n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nSniflheim civil war | Tapas\nGarlemald. After the death of Emperor Solus zos Galvus, the tension between his youngest son\xa0; Titus yae Galvus and his grandson\xa0; Varis yae Galvus reached his peak. Since Emperor Solus died without naming any heir to the Garlean throne, a cold war...\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""No problem! \nThen, I'll be getting started on what I can on yours! "", ""Okay! So, I've just finished reading the first 6 chapters of your book! So, here are some of my thoughts as I was reading!\nChapter One:\n\nTHE MUSIC IS AMAZING!\nCAN THE MUSIC GET ANY BETTER? OMG WHY DOES IT FIT THE SCENE SO WELL? \nOooh the premise is so fascinating! Kind of feels like I've been transported into this fantasy world of Kings and Queens!\nWhat! It's over already?\n\nChapter One Thoughts in a Nutshell:I’m liking it, but I gotta read more before I can come to any conclusions…\nChapter Two\n\nOMG OMG THIS MUSIC IS AMAZING!\nWAS THIS MUSIC MADE FOR YOUR STORY?\nOh snap, they're trying to kill one of the Princes?\n\nChapter Two Thoughts in a Nutshell:This plot with the Kings, Princes, and Princess? I was just eating that stuff up! I love political intrigue dramas and especially ones that are heating up!\nChapter Three:\n\nTHE MUSIC. \nOkay, I'll stop drooling over the music now\nI love Petra. Love her. \n\nChapter Three Thoughts in a Nutshell:\nAt first, I was like I don't know if I'm going to like this new character she sounds kind of like a 2 dimensional fantasy girl... and then I was like omg I like this new character. As we got more time with Petra through the next few chapters; I was like okay, I love Petra. She’s going to have layers to her personality, and I can see I'm already rooting for her to get back with Zenos. \nOVERALL THOUGHTS FOR EVERYTHING:\nThere weren't a lot of details about the setting and other visual elements but it was fast-paced and fit the style of the narrative. On another note, I was really being sucked into the world, and I liked the names of a lot of the characters. The only thing about the characters, is that there were a lot of names for the first few chapters. \nThere were sometimes I was getting lost between who was doing what and how? Now, because the genre is Fantasy, a large cast of characters is pretty much standard, so I know it can't really be helped. But I would say to help readers like me from getting lost between all the titles and long names is to just slowly introduce new characters, or introduce only characters vital to the plot. Whatever you decide, its completely up to you!\nAnother thing, I would say is that there were some apparent grammatical errors and typos throughout. But, I'm sure with another quick edit you can remedy them. \nAs for the world building though, it was just interesting! I could see the difference between some of the cultures depending on the countries. When Petra was added, I could really see how each area was different and had their own customs. But also with that, there were a lot of terms and certain things in the story I didn't know because the world-building was deep. \nFor example, in chapter 3 I think, Petra was finding an outfit to wear for the funeral and at some point in the chapter she mentions about something a Garlean dress. I thought maybe I missed something, because there was no additional detail about the dress so I had no idea what dress I was supposed to be picturing while I read. Same thing for the titles, like Commandante. I felt the people with those titles, should be important, but I just didn't have enough information about it to decide how I supposed to feel. I think this is probably a simple fix, by just using 3rd person omniscient to its full extent. That could mean, describing more about important objects and why they're important, or whatever you feel works. \nSo, final thoughts? I subscribed because I'm interested to read more! I think your story is good, and it has a lot of potential! \n"", ""The summary of Blood Cross has my interest PIQUED.

Oh my goodness this story!! \nFirst Impressions:\n\nAs soon as I played the music for the first chapter, I knew I was in for a good time! \nThe stand-off between Nina and the vampire was a fantastic hook. Nina has a very strong voice, and I really got a sense of her personality, her values/faith, and her disdain for this “vampire filth”!\nI love love love the Western setting. The dry and dusty desert, surrounded by the canyons that “menacingly imposed” upon them emphasized the desolate, dangerous expanse of the wilderness that they’re in. \nYour descriptions in the vampire hunting scenes are visceral and delightfully gory without reveling in the yuckiness, which I appreciate!\nVampires being paralleled with rattlesnakes in the old west is just…chef’s kiss perfect\n\nOverall:\nI had such a fun time reading this! The story is set in a bloody, dusty, dangerous world, and while our two mains have a tough exterior to stand up to it, you can definitely tell that there is something more tender beneath it. I’m attached to them already, and the two have a fantastic dynamic and chemistry! Their conversation in chapter three was probably my favorite part.\n Zayne is especially fun! As they might say in the Old West, he seems like a real flannel mouth (smooth talker). I have to admit, I laughed when he waved at Nina with that vampire’s arm. Also, and maybe I just have a weakness for white-haired characters, but him pouting around his cigarette, calling her “partner/ma’am” and talking about how he’s the “social” one who “gets them all the discounts” was just really darn cute to me!\nI did notice a couple of very minor hiccups! In chapter two there is a typo where Zayne’s hair is described as “the whites of his hair”, which I think should be worded without the plural.\nIn chapter six, Sister Quinn says “Pop quiz!” which somehow feels like a contemporary term to me and took me out of the story a little bit. I couldn’t seem to find any information regarding when people started using the phrase, so it might very well be just my own association! \nOverall, I am so pumped to read the next chapter!! I can tell we’re in for a romp. I’m really looking forward to reading more interactions between Nina and Zayne, and follow how their relationship develops. Zayne is charming, Nina has some walls to break down...I think we’re in for a good time. I’m rootin’ for ‘em! "", ""Of course!   And, ahh, I didn't realize you had influences from Final Fantasy XIV! I like that game series, I'm tying to get into Video Game Lore and Fantasy of it so I think that's interesting your story has influences from it!"", ""Thank you!! Wow, that means a lot to hear! And, hehe, I'm glad you liked Zayne! As for the other comments, thank you for pointing that out! I'll be sure to fix it and watch out for any other errors! \nWith Sister Quinn's Pop Quiz, yeah, you're totally right, I'm sorry that you out the story! I was searching for the etymology of the word and looking for other words, but I just couldn't seem to find a word similar enough that would be good. But, that website you sent me with the Old Western Slang and terms? I don't have enough exclamations marks to say wow, its so extremely helpful!! I already found a few words I can replace to make the story read better. \nSo, anyways with that being said, I'll getting started on yours soon! "", 'Oh man, I love going down rabbit holes about etymology, it\'s so much fun! I was trying to think of an alternative but it is tough. Depending on the year the story takes place, it might be technically correct anyways! It led me to read an interesting article about the word ""quiz"" so I\'ve had an educational afternoon \nThose Old West slangs are a HOOT. I\'m so glad you enjoyed it! My favs so far are ""madder than an old wet hen"" and ""rag proper"" (to dress well).

You wrote how her rifle felt like ice. Since they are in the middle of a desert and it is obviously quite hot as you had described, her rifle would actually be pretty hot to the touch as it\'s mostly made of metal. It would actually probably sear her skin as has happened to me before.

So, here are some of my thoughts as I was reading!\nChapter One:\n\nI love this atmosphere you're creating!!! So ominous and spooky! \nOMG this is so dark and spooky.... I'm so here for it.\n\nChapter One Thoughts in a Nutshell:The details are just stellar! The atmosphere is just, stellar! Everything right now, is just stellar! And, I'm only on the first chapter!\nChapter Two\n\nMy gawd these details make the entire scene riveting! I LOVE IT.\nWhat is this thing hunting this poor man? It's so creepy!! I stan this spooky paranormal stuff.\n\nChapter Two Thoughts in a Nutshell:I'm loving these details! So visceral! And, boy... I love, love how you ended the chapter!\nChapter Three:\n\nAgain, so detailed\nThis atmosphere of the story IS SO ON POINT\nOoh, okay so the plot is piecing together, Tristan is a ghost, maybe??\n\nChapter Three Thoughts in a Nutshell:Love it. I'm still pondering and thinking what it all means... It's snowing now, and people killing their father? I want to know what this all means!\nOVERALL THOUGHTS FOR EVERYTHING:\nOkay. Wowza. This is beautifully written and full of so many lovely details. I fell in love with the atmosphere, and spooky paranormal world. I was only 6 chapters in and I loved everything! I'm excited to read more about Tristan and Morgan (I've got a soft spot for white hair as you can probably tell...).\nI think you really perfected the spookiness that you might see from a Gothic horror novel. Including that, I actually felt a little bit of Hamlet vibes from your story. And, I felt tied to my reading as I was trying to learn more about that thing or Wraith that kept on following Tristan. I was questioning everything... from the snowing imagery to wondering why Tristan killed his father. \nWith that being said, I think the biggest thing that stuck out to me, was the fact that the setting was mysterious and mystical it was really easy to get lost in the swamp of beautiful details. As I was reading, I noticed the details were fantastic, but a bit too metaphorical that it made it just a bit vague.\nFor example, in chapter 1, when we're reading about the dead king coming back to life, at first I was confused on who was coming back. I couldn't really tell if it was Tristan, and I couldn't really piece the context clues on where is he raising from. I know the chapter said that 'dead kings rise from their grave' but, I didn't read any details about the King crawling out from his grave, it just hops into the next setting where he's young again. I'd assumed he went back through time, but couldn't tell for certain until I got around chapter 5-6. \nWhat I'm trying to say is, you describe the scenes so effectively and really lyrical, but I think sometimes it was so 'mystical flowery' that I didn't really have any clarity. However, I think that's what you were going for---- the confusion of being raised from death so I'm not really criticizing that, because I think you pulled that off effectively. I felt the same whirling tornado of confusion Tristan was going through after being risen from the dead. But, then as a reader I got lost in that tornado sometimes. I never really got grounded or stabilized into one location in the story and that gave me some confusion. I couldn't really picture where we were, even though I reading some beautiful details. I wasn't sure if we were in purgatory? Or if Tristan went back his castle? How he got back to his castle? Is he a ghost? Is he corpse? Or is our narrator the literary 'unreliable narrator', and the world we see around Tristan is nothing but an illusion and false sense of reality?\nThis isn't really entirely bad what I'm pointing out, because I feel like that's how we're supposed to feel as readers. But, I think what we should feel and see as readers are two different things. So, I think is a simple fix, if instead of letting readers get too lost, throw us out a hook and line and stabilize before the next transition. I think you can ground readers by just sometimes giving a nugget of clarity before the next thought changes that. For example, just before Morgan is introduced, Tristan is wandering around the halls of I think his castle, and before readers are explained what's happening once more, bam; I think people are seeing Tristan and then suddenly Morgan's introduced and were swooped into this scene where Morgan is injured. Perhaps just a little before that describe how sometimes when he passes a mirror or sees his reflection he is also confused if he just alive again or living in memories. Ground us readers in his reality for a just moment, before the spooky swoops us away, if that makes sense. \nSo, final thoughts? I hope I'm not coming off as mean. I think your work is STELLAR. And I'm not using all caps lightly. It was a beautiful rollercoaster, and I'm about to hit that subscribe button like it's hot because I'm SOLD."", ""Thank you for those warm words! Also, I appreciate you pointing out those things! I didn't recognize the writing seemed intense because I have such a low tolerance for these things lol. Could you tell me which chapters you would say are more intense and graphic? I certainly don't want to get triggered by Tapas, but I wasn't sure would be considered as graphic for their guidelines, so if you could let me know which stuck out to you as more intense or graphic, that would be great! I want to make sure I write at the top of the chapters with a trigger warnings.\nAs for your story, I'm getting started on it soon! I've just been trying to catch up with all of the responses from earlier so its taking me a little second! "", ""@Ruthful I read over a couple chapters of your story. I think you do a nice job with your prose, especially with your first chapter. However, as I read on,  I felt a disconnect as I continued to read. I wasn't sure how the dead king connected to Tristan and his adventure.""]",4/7/2021 7:44,https://forums.tapas.io/t/yay-feedback-for-feedback/57218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is rated Mature and I do have a warning in the beginning about what my novel will have in it to give it that rating, but I'd like to know a few things if you decide to leave me your reviews. In return, I will read yours as well*.
I don't expect anyone to read it in its entirety, I'd appreciate, though of course it's not necessary, if the first 4 episodes are read, as that's about as much as I'll be able to read of yours, unless I genuinely enjoy it. Then I'll be subscribing to it and reading it in my free time.
This is what I'd like to know overall from another perspective.1. Is it interesting and did you enjoy it? Give me your overall thoughts.You don't have to be nice if you didn't enjoy it or find it interesting, by the way. I'm a realist when it comes to critiques and appreciate honesty, even if its brutally honest.2.

My Favorite Sin (AKA What happened to Happily Ever After?) | Tapas
Just call me Sin, everyone else does. 

Before I tell you about my story, I'm going to give you some honest advice.

Don't get drunk and fall down a hole. 

IF you do fall down that hole and someone else is in that hole, don't take anything...





","[""Hey! I love this idea, and I'd love to do this. Here's my story; https://tapas.io/series/Blood-Cross-Novel/info2\nRight now I only have 4 chapters so far, so whatever feedback and criticism you can give I'd appreciate it as well!  \nI'll get started on your soon! I'll try to give you all the honest feedback and comments I can give! "", 'I read your four episodes that were available this morning and as I read it I wrote my notes, so I\'m just going to rewrite them here, for the most part, verbatim.\nBlood CrossFirst chapter, the music made it seem.... cliche? I felt that I was going to be sitting down to watch an Italian western featuring Clint Eastwood. I had to turn the music off as it was distracting me from taking your writing seriously.\nOnce off, * kisses fingertips * the setting, environmental descriptions were on point. They gave enough without overwhelming or underwhelming me as a reader. You made it interesting enough to grab my attention and continue reading, hooking me with your baited lines. \nMy personal bias may be showing, but the fact that I\'m immediately  plunged into an action scene, after some basis of for the tone of your work is set, makes me giddy. This scene immerses me in this world, making me feel like I\'m watching from some protective bubble right there. It makes me ... enthusiastic to continue reading.\nThe music for the next two chapters were good, with my volume turned low as not to be a distraction. With that, my original thoughts on the first chapter musical score, I can understand from the scene why you would pick that particular piece. I did feel that it lacked cohesion with the rest of your musical accompaniments. If I may suggest, please check out some of these songs.\nDark Techno / Industrial / Cyberpunk Mix \'Revenge ll\' | Dark Electro\nIn Episode 4, near the end, the lines start off with, ""By my God. What good can out of this?"" This is the only spot I had to do a double take to make sure I read it correctly.  I believe you already see what happened. I know that my own novel is riddled with these kind of issues, so believe me, I\'m not trying to nitpick.\nWith that being said.....\nThose are the only things I found to be out of place with your work.\nHonestly, in my opinion, your work is F#ING AMAZING! So please continue writing, I will continue reading!', ""Thank you! I appreciate the feedback! \nI thought it was funny you mentioned that it felt like you about to watch a western flick staring Clint Eastwood, lol, because that was actually spot on to where I got my inspiration for the setting of my story. I was actually watching an early Western Flick, and I really wanted to have my story set in the America/Western Frontier, so that's where the story is actually set; the early American frontier, or the Western flatlands really. I wanted the music to be a sort of cliche spaghetti Western theme, but I'll work on the music, because I in no way want the music to impede reading! As for the other comments, thanks for catching that! I'll do some editing and get that fixed right away. As for your story, I'm sure as you saw, I hearted your chapters, and I tried to leave a lot of comments as my brain was processing the story. Now, that I just finished reading 4 chapters from your work and I got to say---and I'm also going to appear biased because I like action and thrillers, but I like it lot! I thought you did a good job of setting the theme and the world. The details were good and there some scenes where I felt right there next to the violence. Including that, I think Sin is an interesting character and I want to know how she became this cool bad apple woman. Overall, it was exciting and fast-paced; I like it. But, I did notice that were times when the writing got a little vague, I mostly noticed this when it came to how some sentences were worded and structured. For example, in the first chapter, I think the 3th paragraph where Sin is talking about being dragged from her car and shot; I was a bit confused on the order of what was happening. Did Sin get shot in the car? Was she already being dragged by the lackey? Or was she just being shot outside? Things like that showed up just a few times through the story, but other than that, again, I like it! When I get some more free time, I'm going to go ahead and continue reading what I can!"", ""I'm sorry, I'm confused. I don't mention her being in a car, or a car at all in that first chapter. I think you're referring to the holding cell scene though. I see what you mean the way I structured the sentences in that paragraph, I should rearrange them because they do seem out of order.I was vague about some details of this scene, but first novel, bound to be some mistakes. Thank you very much I appreciate the constructive criticism on my novel. I'm also glad you are enjoying it so far.\nNow about your music... Since that's what you were going for and got your inspiration from ..... then keep it!  That was just my opinion, and it's your novel, (which is awesome!) so keep it the way you intended it to be. Now that I know that's where you were coming from it makes complete sense. I'll just have my volume on low when I'm reading, that way the good, the bad, and the ugly doesn't keep popping into my mental imagery, lol, instead of your story."", ""No need to apologize! I'm sorry, that's exactly the scene I'm referring to is, the cell scene. It seems I got the settings mixed up, in my head I thought she was in a car before she got dragged into the cell area.\nAnd no worries about the details, it was still very detailed, it just there moments in the setting I got a little lost where things were happening as you can tell I mixed up her being in a car, lol. But anyways, I'm glad I could help as fellow writer!\nFor the music, thanks! Since it came off as jarring on your first read, I might still go ahead adjust it, lol. \nOverall, I'm glad you enjoyed my work as well! This has just made my day! "", ""Hello! I read your first four chapters. I've been told that I tend to phrase things kind of bluntly, so sorry in advance if any of this comes off as harsh.\n\nIt was definitely an interesting premise! I enjoyed it overall.\nI won’t get into grammar or punctuation, but I will get into some of the formatting. Some formatting stuff is style preferences, so let me know if you have any references that you are shooting for it to read like or otherwise inspired by. \n\nNotes and overall first impressions as I read:\nCh1\n\nThug #1 pissed himself very easily lol\nAre they in a cave? “...turning to head back up from the basement’s dug-out hallways following my drag marks my body left.” is what made me question whether or not the setting was ever described. I assumed that they were still outside after she’d been shot. Why are they dragging her body into a basement?\nOh, it’s a warehouse near a hiking trail?\nWhat drug is intravenous and makes you macho? What is that? It’s def not heroine, which was my first assumption when it said he was shooting up. Fantasy drugs maybe? It's probably no that important.\nHer jaw was shattered from being punched? I could see dislocated, but shattered is intense. This dude either has trucks for fists or she has glass bones.\n\nCh2\n\nI don’t know that anything is added by delaying the full description of the man dying. The reader knows he dies and how, so it feels weird that this is reserved for a few paragraphs later.\nI too love blowing things up. 100% relatable.\n\nCh3\nThis chapter is a contrast to the first two. I’m not a big romance guy tho, so not much I can comment on. The sex scene is fine. It kind of surprised me, but I think that’s because I don’t read romance.\nCh4\n\nPreface who “he” is in the first sentence. It’s the beginning of the chapter and I immediately thought it was Cass until I read the rest of the sentence.\nHomeboy John goes for two rounds, what a champ.\nIsn’t a 180-degree balcony just a balcony?\nI have no idea where this house is or what it looks like. How she decorates would be a great insight into her daily life/personality. There is no scenery description either besides that she has photographs. Is this a city/suburb/rural/I’m assuming this is the US?\n\nSetting:    You can definitely fit in more scene descriptions. Most of the time I’m only vaguely aware of where the characters are.\nFormatting:\n\nTense issues. Try and keep things phrased in past tense unless it’s dialogue or a thought. When the tense shifts back and forth it make reading feel cluncky.\nThoughts should be in italics and not quotes. I’m pretty sure italics is the most common way to convey thoughts with formatting, but correct me if I’m wrong or you have a reference/example. I got confused a few times with what was dialogue even though you used the ‘ instead of “.\nSome issue with telling instead of showing.\n\nExample: “There’d about 10 kids in the call all between the ages of 6-13.” As a reader, I didn’t get to see these kids. I don’t know if they’re grubby and starving or well dressed and groomed etc.It feels like a lot of the scenes do this as well. I don’t feel like I’m watching it happen. It makes it less immersive and harder to get into a flow of reading. I can pick out a few more examples if you need help spotting this.\n\nThe pace is quick and energetic, matching the plot and setting.\n(This might be a personal preference) When there’s a major shift in the time/setting you can make it a new chapter. The little breaks (ex: …..back to the current excitement...) kind of cut off the flow of reading for me. It’s ok to have chapters that are of varying lengths.\n\nMood/tone/theme\nAction, Comedy (a bit of a dark comedy), fantastical. The mood is overall lighthearted and goofy, mostly due to the main character’s general attitude and demeanor. 80’s-esk oneliners (Total Recall is one example that comes to mind). Kinda wish this took place in the ’80s. There are also some Santa Clarita Diet vibes with the whole comedy-horror aspect.\nMain character \nCocky, goofy, easy-going, alcoholic/addictive personality (?). Overall I like her. Her devil-may-care attitude makes perfect sense in light of her being an immortal 104 yo.\nAgain, overall I like the premise and the characters!\nI‘ll link mine down here. I’m in the editing phase and appreciate any and all feedback since I'm using this to learn how to write better. I know the intro to the main plot is on the slow side and that’s intentional.\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nBoil Frogs Slowly | Tapas\nA foster kid gets sent back to a boys home in a small town where he reunites with old friends and a few new ones. When a local girl turns up dead it becomes apparent that not all of his friends are who they appear to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""Thank you so much for your feedback! I appreciate it and didn't find it harsh at all so no need to feel apologetic!\n\nI'm so glad you enjoyed it overall!\nI understand that their are some grammar and punctuation errors, not to mention a mixture in formats. My inspiration came from a multitude of examples. Think Guy Ritchie meets M. Night Shyamalan. As it is my own novel, I find it hard sometimes to catch certain types of mistakes. Which is why I was looking for others to help me review my story. \n\nCh.1 Thoughts\n\nThug 1 was just dragging her dead body.... in my defense, I'd piss myself if I was that Thug.\nAbout the dug out tunnels..... this was from a mixture of my own thoughts and real information about drug cartel using tunnels not only to move large amounts of product in areas where it may be obvious with traffic but also to smuggle drugs into safe houses across the borders. I'm not sure if you read before or after I made a few changes when someone else pointed out that they had some confusion for that scene as well. Anyways, my thought process was if I had to dispose of a body, I'd bury it not drag it outside of the building... but of course I don't go into explaining that for the reader either.\nPCP is what I was thinking of when I wrote it.\nI should change that to dislocated, thank you.\nThe full description is written for a reason, which comes later in the novel.Ch.3The story is a blend of action, drama, romance, fantasy, with some smut scenes through out. Not everyone's cup of tea, I accept that.Ch. 4\nI originally wrote this on a different platform and had to chop some chapters in half due to Tapas 15,000 character limit. I'll fix that too.\nI'll tell him someone else was impressed... lol\nYou are absolutely correct about the balcony.\nI mention she's in San Diego but don't give much more information on that. Nor do I inform the reader that she decorates her home to be a mixture of mid-century modern with rustic touches through out.\nAnother reason why I asked for the review, because I tend to get ahead of myself and forget details...\nI'll work on those tense issues when I come across them, thank you for pointing those out.\nThe thoughts not being in italics is from writing on a different platform that doesn't give the option of using italics, so my apologies on the confusion.\nI know I can get carried away and forget to show, instead of tell, I'll work on that some more.\nThe major shifts in time/setting, are a personal preference but understand your point.\n\nMood/Tone/ThemeLOL My husband said he felt it was taking place in the late 80's early 90's more so than current time.\nI'm delighted you gave me some in depth and honest thoughts. I'll work on what I can and work on evolving and developing my writing to be better.I'll be reviewing yours once I am finished reading it. Thank you so much again!"", ""I’m glad I didn’t come off as harsh!\nThere is one point it sounds like I should have been more specific on. The full description of his death is good!\nBy “full description” I mean this part (it’s in the Earlier flashback bit):“He was being so brave, even though there was not enough morphine until our new supplies arrived he let me begin the process of taking the shrapnel out…”This whole chunk is great! I would like to have read this while it was happening instead of in a flashback. It would make a bigger impact if it were the reader’s first interaction with this man’s death.\nI think you should swap its location within the writing with this part above it: “An hour later and I’m looking into his cold, lifeless eyes, as I was inexperienced in performing surgery alone and run down to boot...”This chunk sounds like more of a reference/flashback to an event that the reader already knows about. It’s not as immersive or engaging, (which would be totally fine for a flashback to something the reader already knows). \nThe initial description should be more impactful than the flashback. The reader doesn’t need his death to be redescribed, in full detail, in the flashback if the initial description is strong. It will still have the emotional impact you want if it’s just referenced/alluded to, especially since the reader is seeing Sin’s reactions and feelings.\nI hope that's more clear!"", 'Yes, that made your intention much clearer. Thank you!', 'So I just finished reading episodes 1-17 of Boil Frogs Slowly. I read that many since they were all spliced chapters and felt that those were the actual first four chapters.\nFirst off, honestly, this is not something I would have picked out to read if I came across it when looking for new stories to read. Slice of life type novels just are not my thing, but I can still appreciate someones hard work that they put into something.\nThat being said.....Episode 1\n\nYou could feel the tension in the room and Jacks obvious defeated disposition.\nThere\'s more to this situation than what is being hinted at and what Mr. Green knows, show cased by Jacks little bits of anxious thoughts. \n""Am I being detained or am I free to go?"" ..... typical teenage response when they know the person in front of them can\'t touch them....\nI\'m finding it hard to like Jack at this point in time , so far I can tell he\'s been punished and sent back to this place he\'s in. However, Mr. Green, who Jack seems to have some kind of history of interaction with, does seem to genuinely want to help Jack and Jack can\'t see that. Makes me curious what Jack did....\n\nEpisode 2\nSo I am starting to care about the MC Jack, but don\'t understand your in depth description of the mystery meat sloppy joe?\nEpisode 3 \n\nIs that why he got sent back? Over a dumb teenage girl invading peoples private space, thinking just cause she\'s acting cute and flirty she can get away with what ever? I would have made the bimbo eat the frog..... \nThis can\'t be the entirety of why, Mr. Green mentioned he was lucky no one was pressing charges..... \nKyle\'s a punk, deserves that sloppy joe thrown right back at him. \n\nEpisode 4\n\nDamn sucks to get your a$$ beat, but that\'s life sometimes. \nI get the sloppy joe description prior, but I feel like I\'m going to give you the same advice you gave me and instead of having the descriptions of it split up as is and putting those two parts together.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nAve is avenue, not a road Jackie boy.\nIt\'s no surprise Kyle is such a bully, he tries to force control over something else in his life to compensate for the lack of control in his own....\n\nI\'m glad you told me that this had a slow start, otherwise I probably wouldn\'t have read much more past this point. \nThis bleak, unfair situation has been described in great detail now, maybe in some areas a little overwhelming with detail, that it disrupts the flow for me.\nMoving on though, the next few episodes, the bathroom...\n\nI\'m honestly shocked that Devon didn\'t kick the sh*t out of Kyle, especially since Kyle was a minute away from killing Jack... possibly less. \nI don\'t know how Jack was able to even lay in that bunk if it still smelled like Kyle.\nAlso Ew... No one washed the sheets between children? They use all that disinfectant around the rest of the place but leave dirty sheets on a bed?\n\nNervous Episodes\n\nQuinn speaks! \nJack not being a douche to Quinn for the day prior, seems a little unrealistic that he\'d not be even a little upset about it considering that was his reaction prior. I\'ll give it to him since he does have this self-depreciation personality.\nDamn... Quinn gets scalded and hardly bats an eye?! \nI agree with your own comment on ""You\'re the one who wants me."" \nIt feels out of play and doesn\'t really describe accurately how Kyle preys upon Jack at every opportunity.\nOnce again, Kyle is a punk, I hope some one knocks him good one day.\nQuinn popping his own blister.... OUCH! Makes me have flashbacks of a 2nd degree chemical burn on my finger tips I had years ago.\n\nMicrowave Episodes\n\nSo we get a little insight into Evan\'s life with his divorced parents.\nLMAO Jack chokes..... give it 5-10 minutes, he\'ll be so high, he\'ll be the first one to make it to Mars...\nThe flow has picked up now and I am finding it more appealing as I go along. It is definitely a slice of life novel so far.\nThe rapport forming between the boys is quite natural and feels very realistic.\n\nOverall.... I wish it was not as slow as it was in the first few episodes, but eventually you got the pace up. Like I said earlier, not my preferred genre of choice and not something I normally would choose to read. I\'m happy to say, I\'ve changed my mind and you have me intrigued to further my willingness to observe and see how your story will develop. Your story, to me, seems like one that should be judged as a whole, not just a few episodes, if that makes sense to you.', ""Thank you! I'll defiantly be adding your suggestions to my editing list!\nI'm going to go back in and adjust the pacing of the first few chapters to speed it up. I think I'm overthinking it and holding on to some unnecessary situational development that can be cut.\nJust to share what my general constraints are on this novel: My main premise/theme is loosely about how teenage boys don't/refuse to talk about their difficult feelings, and how harmful that can be. I'm still nailing down some of the loose ends on this as I edit. The title is supposed to be a metaphor for how the plot is structured as well (that old myth about how to boil frogs)\nThank you again! I'd be happy to swap reviews again sometime if you're ever in need of a second opinion or want more feedback!"", 'First of all, I love your storytelling and how your character ""narrates"" things. It makes it so much more interesting and is similar to how I write ^_^ \u200bThe dynamic between Sin and John is really interesting. I like the way she got her ""power"" and the details of her past.Overall, I really enjoyed your story and I will continue reading it later on!\nHere is the only critique I can really come up with even though I read the first 4 chapters.\nIn chapter 1 there is a bit too much telling with the remote detonator in the shoe. ""It\'s for the C-4 explosives I set up earlier..."" She already has mentioned there will be a big blast and then pulls out a remote detonator. I feel like the sentence I paraphrased is just a bit redundant and also takes away from the experience later on of her seeing that the bad guys are all on a truck that she has rigged with explosives.\nHere is my story. I appreciate any feedback!\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nRed Dragon Part 1: Broken | Tapas\nFollow the journey of a boy from Shinjuku, Japan known as the infamous assassin Red Dragon. He mysteriously ends up in California in the care of the McRae family, unable to remember how he got there and unable to return to Japan.\nWith no where left...\n\n\n\n\n\n', '@ZakuraTheFungi \nThank you for reading and providing feedback on my story. I\'ll make the necessary modifications, as soon as possible.I appreciate that you enjoyed it so far and will continue to read it!\nIt took me longer than I expected to get to reading and returning some feedback. Apologies about that. C\'est la vie. {shoulder shrugs}\n1st chapter\n\nStarts off with an action scene... I likey. \nI believe you left a word out of this sentence, ""I twist and ^ drops the knife""  ^he I believe is missing.\nMC needs to throw out all those old noodle cups....\n""Meet at location^ seven.""  ^, use a comma after location. Otherwise someone could assume the person reading it could be named Seven. We\'ve heard of the name Four so....\nA professional assassin or hit man would never arrive onto a job and have to load his weapon.... unless they just (within the last 5 minutes) emptied their clip. In that kind of world, double crosses, ambushes, and just plain bad luck of the draw can happen anytime. A good assassin/hit man is always prepared.\nOh well, look at that... a prepared target.... He shouldn\'t have let him talk so much, just bang, noodle cup time.....\nSalt water=Ocean ...  either 1.he was sent to sleep with the fishes, 2. the boat he was on sinks, 3. or plane crashed....\n\nOverall great beginning. The action scene right off, grabs my attention and kept it with his capture by an enemy that\'s closer than an enemy should be. Makes me curious to find out why he\'s in the ocean now...\nCh.2\n\nA white star on his head or the horses? I\'d replace \'his head\' with \'its head\'\nYou have a sentence that is grammatically incorrect, ""The feeling of the breeze flowing through my hair is my most favorite thing."" Favorite is an absolute idea, which means you can\'t qualify it with a comparative or superlative form. Something can be more favored though. You can keep it in its informal form as is, or just remove the \'most\'.\nJeremiah must be a Hoss to pick up another person dead weight and put him in the saddle, get up and get down from the saddle with out our MC falling off. \nLucky thing Mama is a doctor.\n\nSide note Do you speak Japanese? \nCh.3 \n\nThis was pointed out to me in my own story, so I\'ll give you the same advice. The MC thoughts should be shown in Italics, that way the reader as a visual clue to pick up on that they are reading a thought without it disrupting the flow.\nShyba...Sheeba? Shayba? See-ba? How do you pronounce the name he gave Kiara and her family?\n\nCh.4\nOkay her reaction to being caught talking to the plants seems a tad dramatic. I understand her emotions and reaction are tied to the fact that she\'s doing something that\'s related to memories of her father (who died? haven\'t found this out exactly yet). However, our MC isn\'t described to be smiling, or forcing himself to keep a straight face so I feel her immediate tears and quick demand to ""Not laugh"" was a bit overboard. Unless there\'s a reason for this reaction that we find out later. I would remove the tears and keep it to defensive body language, like how her fists were.\nFinal thoughts\nI\'ve subscribed, but I think you know that by now. So I am enjoying your novel  so please don\'t take anything I\'ve said or will say wrong but the first four chapters definitely teased me. (which could be a good thing since I\'m coming back for more?)\nSo far, you\'ve kept it  interesting and steady with the scenes, but I want to know more about the MC. Not just his anxious thoughts over a gun and a coat or distrust of this family who saved his life, but WHY the thoughts of Tokyo are causing the anxiety about his master. Even a sliver of information more about our dear MC would be nice. So far he seems pretty bland for a hardened teenage assassin with red eyes.... I\'m hoping the next few chapters will give me what I\'m looking for. I look forward to continuing to read your work.Thank You!', 'Thank you for the feedback! I have had a hard time getting quality feedback other than ""it\'s good"", so I\'m very thankful for your thought out review!\nFirst thing about your side note, while I am not fluent I have studied Japanese for many years and I have more than basic knowledge of it. I also have a friend who is Japanese who corrects my translations when necessary ^_^ I don\'t use a lot of it in this story though because I don\'t want the translations to be too distracting and he already knows English.\n""Meet at location^ seven."" ^, use a comma after location. Otherwise someone could assume the person reading it could be named Seven. We\'ve heard of the name Four so....\nI feel like if that were his codename it would be capitalized, right? Putting a comma there feels weird to me. I can\'t put my finger on it, but I have changed it to ""Meet at the seventh location.""\nAlso, thanks for pointing out about him needing to be prepared with his gun as a professional. I will adjust that scene.\nJeremiah must be a Hoss to pick up another person dead weight and put him in the saddle, get up and get down from the saddle with out our MC falling off.\nJeremiah takes after my brother a lot, who is also a farmhand. He is capable of doing this, but I can see why you would point it out  I have reflected on this scene and have come up with a solution to make it more believable. I have changed it so that Jeremiah has the horse kneel down so that it is easier for him to get Shyba up on his back.\nThis was pointed out to me in my own story, so I\'ll give you the same advice. The MC thoughts should be shown in Italics, that way the reader as a visual clue to pick up on that they are reading a thought without it disrupting the flow.\nThis has been pointed out to me too and I always feel weird when I try to do this. I know it has something to do with the way my brain actually ""narrates"". I recently learned that there are either people who hear their own thoughts and those that don\'t. I think that has something to do with it. I suppose italicizing thoughts is the norm though so I should just bite the bullet and do it even though, to me, it breaks the flow \nShyba...Sheeba? Shayba? See-ba? How do you pronounce the name he gave Kiara and her family?\nIt is pronounced how it is spelled  Shy-ba\nOkay her reaction to being caught talking to the plants seems a tad dramatic.

I\'m hoping the next few chapters will give me what I\'m looking for.\nThis is the type of feedback I\'ve been looking for! I have been wondering if perhaps he is too ""soft"". My line of thinking was that he has obviously had some sort of trauma, but I have a difficult time determining how ""hardened"" he should be because of certain aspects of his personality and how he has had to survive. Though, the chapter you\'re looking for may be just a few more up ahead.I will reflect on this further though.\nI really enjoyed reading your thoughts overall and appreciate everything you pointed out ^_^', ""@ZakuraTheFungi That's cool though, Japanese is one of those languages I'd like to learn eventually. \nThank you for clarifying that it was the seventh location. The way I was reading it I took seven being the time, hence why I suggested the comma.\nYour brother must have been taught by a real farmer than how to farmhand.

It's comics only, I'm sorry novelists. But I'm more experienced in comic making so I'm not sure how valuable my critique would be to your works or do it justice 
I'll generally do all comics and genres, but if a comic makes me really uncomfortable, say things happen like r*pe,  harassing over mental disorders and very political opinions then I might skip over yours. Sorry

151,Looking for a Reviewer (Unpaid),Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey there, I'm in need of a reviewer for my novel, Paint Me a Murder. I just completed the third draft and posted it on here. While I'm happy with the improvements I've made, I feel like there's still some things I need fixing and an extra set of eyes would really help me out. In return, I'll read and review your story too. I'll be as thorough and nit-picky as you'd prefer.
Just a little heads up, this story is a mystery and crime drama. It handles sensitive subjects like drug abuse and violence. This story also features a gay couple, which I don't suppose needs a warning considering how LGBTQ friendly Tapas is, but just thought I'd include that to give you a brief idea of the story.
What I'm looking for help with: Overall plot, building suspense, character development(not just the MC), transitioning chapters, and my ending. Boy, you have no idea how much I've struggled with my ending. It's still nowhere near perfect, but I'm satisfied enough with it. That doesn't limit what you should point out. Feel free to critique everything, including grammar and spelling mistakes. 
Scheduling: This is completely up to you, as I'm in no hurry. However many chapters you can review a week is fine with me. We can either do this directly on Tapas or I can share a Google Doc, which might be easier to point particular issues out.
Just reply here on this thread and we can work something out! Feel free to ask any questions you might have too. Here's the link to my novel so you can check it out and see if it's something you'd be willing to read.

153,Help a newbie with genres?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello everyone! I'm probably overthinking this, but I wonder if I've labeled my story correctly. Right now, the main genre is Drama, followed by BL and Horror. But maybe the main genre is actually BL? Or LGBTQ+? Should it be Romance instead of Horror? My head is spinning!
The m/m romance is definitely the main focus of the story, but it is pretty melodramatic and has some horror elements.
I suppose my question is: On Tapas specifically, how would the community define and categorize the genres Drama, BL, Horror, and Romance? Also, if you have the time, would you consider briefly glancing over my story and letting me know what genres you perceive it to be so far? I would appreciate the feedback very much

 I'm trying for a realistic Science fiction Fantasy drama slice of life. Well, I'm hoping it is far away from mainstream plots, so if it's not, I love to know that also in your feedback if it's not original enough.
But other than that, I want the people and the MC to seem real. Also, what about the flow? Is it slow? Is it too fast? Yeah, I need feedback.
I don't care if you like it or not or if it not your cup of tea.
 What I want to know most is there too much detail or not enough, or does it just a complete mess that makes your head hurt and stop reading it? or is it plan boring and not worth reading?

","[""Your novel is interesting, I'm only into the second chapter but have a few things already that I'm mildly confused about.1. TTRG is this a acronym? IF so, for what does it stand for?2. Empty milky way galaxy with 9 artificial planets and a fake sun? What  and how did this happen that the rest of the universe disappeared? I feel like this should be explained a little more then just a short paragraph.3. The boy in the first chapter that is decapitated.... Why is she washing off guts from a decapitation? You stated you were going for a realistic science fiction slice of life and decapitations may contain some bits of flesh and gore if it's requiring multiple cuts or hacks type of decapitation, but not guts.\n It's just that first chapter so far that is mildly confusing with the settings of your story, the second chapter is better developed to me. The second chapter also flows better than the first.  It feels more natural when reading it, making a clearer picture in my mind as I read.  Unlike the first, where I had to go back over a few paragraphs once or twice to make sure I wasn't skipping information.\nA personality for the MC Zaily and Odessa are becoming evident and so far they seem realistic enough considering this spectrum of genres you are involving and the world setting you have thus far provided.I'll continue to read it and see how it develops later before I can give you a complete and honest review on the flow and whether or not details are needed or should be edited out. So far, I find it interesting enough to continue reading it but will let you know if I lose interest. As I read more I'll give more insight.Hope that helps a little"", ""First thing I wanna say is that you should edit your Description. It is a little too long with a lot of information about the story that should probably be left to be found out by reading the story. The Description should be short and to the point. It should give the gist of the story. \nHere is an example of my Novel Description to give you an idea:\nIn a post apocalyptic flooded world, the last remaining humans live on large Navy Aircraft Carrier ships huddled together forming a city. The wealthiest people enslaved and oppressed the rest of the masses to keep full control and power. \nTwo Lovers who share the same hatred for the Government, try to find a way to escape from the city in order to search for land so they can be free. \nMeanwhile as the two Lovers search for a way to escape from the city, two Police Detectives investigate a series of unsolved crimes and murders around the city that may or may not be linked to the Lovers.\nThird Person Narrative.\nSimilar Stories: (Some of these stories may be less similar than others, i.e. no fantasy elements, but they have overlapping content and themes.) Titanic (movie) 1984\nThe Notebook\nGhost (movie) If you like love stories like this then I think you’ll like mine.\nThe Terminator\nSherlock Holmes\nSnowpiercer\nDexter\nStar Wars Attack Of The Clones\nWARNING THIS STORY CONTAINS:Drama, Romance, SciFi, Dystopian, Mystery, Detectives, YA, Post apocalyptic, Futuristic, Dark Themes, Adult Themes, Mature Content, Tyrannical Government, Death, Violence, Love, Marriage, Babies, Revenge, Friendships, Conspiracy, Detective Work, Violent Crimes, Police, Murder, Interrogation, Black Market Deals, Grudges, Slavery, Psychological, Trauma, Guns, Freedom, Bonds, Trust, Blood, Hospitals, Large Ships, Swimming, Treasure, Money, Hiding, Explicit Language, \nDrama #Romance #SciFi #Dystopian #Mystery #Detective #YA #Postapocalyptic #Futuristic\n\nI think providing a short list of similar stories will give readers a better idea of whether they would be interested to read your story. This will also funnel down and attract the primary audience that you are targeting. By mentioning what the story contains it will make it easier for readers to decide whether they want to read it or not. This works well because it provides info about the story without really spoiling anything about it.\nAs you see in my Description I condensed my story down to just a couple of sentences while retaining the main conflict of the story. Try to break it down to the bare minimum: Main Character(s), Setting/Concept, Conflict, Main Character’s Goal. Hope this helps.\nAll I can really say about your writing in the first Chapter is that it is confusing. I feel like the characters aren't introduced all that well in terms of their looks age height etc."", 'thank for tell me when I have time to read more of what you said O will surely go back and try to fix what you have told me thank you so much Mnheller87 this helps a lot I thought I said what TTRG stood for Time Travel regulations government', ""Yeah my discribtion is pretty long but I don't know If I want to talk about all the details of the races later on lol there's a lot of information that I know about that I fee will be hard to add into the story naturally  but I get what you mean""]",4/4/2021 18:07,https://forums.tapas.io/t/i-dont-normally-ask-feedback-but-i-really-need-to-know-i-putting-too-much-detail-or-not-enough-detail-in-my-novel-my-novel-is-mature-so-you-been-warned/56958,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the writers/creators: What are you looking for in good feedback? What part of your writing process, or the end product, are you most interested in hearing about? 
I'll go first! I try to give short and to the point feedback, overwhelming people with impressions and criticism can make a project feel unsalvageable(?) and I try to give actionable items like  'clarify which tense is being used.'","[""I went to college - undergrad and grad school - for writing. (Take that however you'd like - look at all the money I wasted, or look at the experience I gained - I have yet to determine this for myself lmao). Since my degree is in writing, a lot of classes focused on workshops, and I've come to really value them. That being said - I think it was ingrained in me to give lots of feedback. So when someone asks me for feedback, I probably give more than they're expecting. I mean, I'll go through every single line sometimes, if I feel it all needs work. I have been known to give pages of notes. I'm going to be honest - I'll tell you what works, what I think doesn't work. I'll go as nit picky as pointing out grammar and spelling, and I'll give you feedback on the overall story/plot. I cover every aspect that comes up - sentence structure, plot holes, character development, etc, etc, etc. If I have questions, I'll ask. Literally anything that comes up when I'm reading, I'll mention. Because that's how it was in our workshop classes - the whole point was to give as much feedback as possible to help the writer improve upon their story. So, you won't get anything simple from me. I want to help, and that's my goal when I give feedback. Nothing is off the table."", ""Yeah totally! I didn't mean I was going to sugarcoat anything or avoid complex issues, rather, that if the feedback feels manageable and can lead to improvement it can lead to actually being implemented! I haven't edited in an 'industry' setting and so that might be coloring my own feelings on feedback."", 'First feedback or any comments just means to you invoked a reaction! Which is great in of itself.\nI learned that you ultimately have to take feedback with a grain of salt and look for the things you can change in your work. Such as the things @kayylynnx mentioned. I\'ve reviewed pieces where everybody is saying the same things ""Fix A,B, C and D."" I\'d pay more head to issues like that. Those issues can stop a reader from wanting to keep reading.\nHowever, if you get a comment such as ""What does that mean?"" or ""This needs more detail"" (two critiques I\'ve gotten) and they provide no follow up to explain their reasoning. I would ignore it. The stubborn side of me won\'t fix an issue if I don\'t know why it\'s wrong.', 'This ^^ Kind of where I meant to go with my response, but then drifted because I\'m distracted today lol! But YES! It\'s all about the WHY. Support your feedback. That\'s what I aim to give, and what I look for as a writer seeking feedback as well. I want to know and I want to explain to the author why something does or doesn\'t work. Feedback is only valuable when it\'s written to help the writer, so as someone giving feedback, you gotta be able to support your claim, so to speak, or find ways to help the writer fix something, at the very least. ""I don\'t like this"" kinda comments don\'t help anyone.', ""That's really helpful! I'm gearing up to ask for a feedback for feedback, like read for read, and it's super helpful to hear what authors find useful!"", ""As an artist, redlines and paint-overs are ENORMOUSLY helpful. They're obviously quite time-consuming, but every time I've received one I've been absolutely over the moon about it, and it's really helped jump-start improvement in my next few pieces.\nBeyond that, concrete examples of what the person giving feedback is trying to describe are great! For instance, if there are issues with movement in a fight scene, linking to a comic page with amazing dynamism and movement in a fight scene, and breaking down what's going on and why it works, will do wonders for me.\nI really like feedback that is descriptive, but direct. I don't need sugar-coating. I am going to be stung a little by it, but that's my problem. (ADHD emotional sensitivity to criticism is a... thing...) I'll usually take 24 hours to process it and allow it to settle before looking at it again with more objectivity and less emotion. At that point, I'm able to go through and pick out a few points to focus on improving. Give it a week, and I'm probably taking most of it as gospel and am super grateful for it."", ""When I edit other people's works, I tend to try and educate them. Not in a mean way, but if they have a comma splice, I want to point it out. Then, after pointing it out, I want to tell what makes it a comma splice and give them a few possible ways to correct it. I also like to help with awkward phrasing by explaining why it's awkward and then providing ways that could help it.\nWhen it comes to people critiquing me, I take everything personally. Everything I write is my baby, but I get over it and fix the issue. I like when people tear me a new one and tell me everything that is wrong. Yeah, I'm going to hate them for a solid hour, but after the hour, I'll start reworking the story. Then, I'll hate them while I rework the story because who the hell wants to rework their story? However, in the end, it makes my stories better and helps me improve along the way. Plus, when it comes down to it, it is my work. If I don't agree with what the other said, then I don't have to change a thing."", ""Exactly like you said I both want to educate and be educated by others with more experience! Haha, I guess it's hard too, critiquing something that already is published where it can't be easily reworked. It's like getting critique on something that exists only to try and apply it to something that doesn't yet exist."", 'For now I\'m not looking for something particular.

To: Amycheng@gmail.com
Subject: (GO FUCK YOURSELF BITCH)
Dear Amy, I just wanted to tell you that I think you are the most vile, manipulating, lying, cruel, bitch I’ve ever met. What you and Hannah did was fucked up. I can’t believe how stupid I was for thinking that you were actually nice to me and were my friend. And that you actually liked hanging out with me. I thought you actually cared but I realized too late that you don’t give a shit about me and you were just pretending to be nice to me and pretending to be my friend just so you could make fun of me and laugh at me with your bitch friends. And you wanna know the worst part of it, you don’t even know. You kept bugging me asking if I liked Hannah and finally I said yes just to shut you up. But what I was gonna tell you before you went behind the wall to tell your friends was that “I like Hannah but not as much as I like you.” I thought you were smart, funny, cool to hang around with and very pretty. The more we hung out the more I started to like you. And it was all just bullshit and I fell for it. I wont make that mistake again good bye and go fuck yourself.
Adair looked over the email and hovered the mouse over the send icon contemplating if he should click send or not. He was still enraged at her thinking about it.

1ST PARAGRAPH VERSION 2: 
Amy held Adair’s hand and brought him into the empty gymnasium. Then Amy brought him to the end of the wall that divided the two basketball courts.
“So do you like Hannah?” asked Amy.
“I’m not gonna tell you.” said Adair coyly.
“Come on, I won’t tell anyone it’ll be our secret.” said Amy. Adair nervously thought of what to do.
“So do you like her?” asked Amy. He looked down nervously contemplating what to say. 
(Ok, fuck it, here goes.) thought Adair.
“Ok, I like her but-“ said Adair. Then he saw Amy start going around the side of the wall.
“Wait, you didn’t hear what I was going to say.” said Adair. Amy stopped at the end of the wall and looked back at him.
“What were you going to say?” asked Amy.
“What I was gonna say was...” said Adair.
“...I like Hannah but not as much as I like you. I really like you Amy. You are smart, funny and you were the first person who was nice to me when I first got here. And you’re just a really fun person to be around. There I said it. And I-” said Adair.
“-I like you too.” said Amy.
“Really?” said Adair.
“Yeah.” said Amy.
Then Adair started to lean in to kiss her and Amy leaned in also. He closed his eyes and they kissed each other while holding hands softly. 
ADAIR ENDED HIS DAYDREAM AND FELT HIS HEART BEATING REALLY FAST.
Adair stood behind the wall inside the gym and waited for Amy to come around the wall to meet him so that he could tell her how he felt about her. 
He tried to remember the sentences he just came up with a few seconds ago and memorize them so he could say it to her for real when she came back. He started whispering to himself quietly—
—“I was gonna tell you that ‘I like Hannah but I like you more,- no. But not as much as I like you. ‘I like Hannah but not as much as I like you.’ ‘I like Hannah but not as much as I like you.’ You’re smart, funny and you were the first one to- who was nice to me when I first got here. (Got it.) I really like you Amy. There I said it. And I wanna go out with you.” whispered Adair to himself.
Then he heard footsteps of someone walking over from around the wall.

It\'s not clear what the overall impression I\'m meant to get of what this is, what the tone is and why I should be interested.\nThe blurb really needs looking over for grammar and phrasing by somebody with strong English skills.

That is hard to do and must be recognized.The good things! Script, you are great with the planing and overall ideas to keep the story going, the jokes, and the cliffhanger to attract people over the next loading page. Absolutely great.The not so great, but not at all bad. Drawing. I know that this is a hard issue to take, because its what hurts the most for a comic artist, but hear me first, you are not wrong in the path that you are going. I think that your style might benefit from the use of vector style drawing and painting, and it would have a feel like 'Gravity Falls', or, if you can go into a different direction and try to detail more of the backgrounds and it would look a bit more like 'Scott Pilgrim'. Also, the Paneling could be better, but worry not, it could be a lot worse too, so for me its a good instead of a bad.\nThat is my overall critique.Hope to see more from you in the future, don't give up!"", ""Hi Aleksei!\nThank you so much for taking the time to read through my comic and give me your feedback, I greatly appreciate it!!

I take no offense at all and will definitely be keeping everything you've said in mind. Also great to know about the paneling. Glad it's a bit more good than bad, haha! Going to focus more on that as well. A fantastic, honest critique, once again you have my thanks!! "", 'No problem at all! It was a pleasure to read! =D', ""Subscribed. I love how expressive the characters are, especially with all the crazy stuff going on. The art seems a bit rough, though, particularly the backgrounds. I like how they're painted to stand out amongst the characters, though I think the backgrounds could use a little cleaning up. Also, I feel like the pages don't fade into each other super well. It's not too much of an issue, more an aesthetic nitpick if anything. I've noticed comics tend to blend a little bit better when they use a page border.\nI enjoy the characters so far. I get the feeling that Bally had to grow up kind of fast for her age, considering her parents seem to be busy/not there and she seems poor. I can feel Bally's friendship with Andy, and Andy himself seems like the kind of guy who has your back. I look forward seeing how you write Bally and her friends in the future. Everything so far seems pretty consistent with the aesthetic of the 90s, and it's not rubbing it in my face.\nHope you find my feedback helpful!"", ""THANK YOU very much for reading through my comic, subscribing, and especially for sharing all your thoughts! I would definitely have to agree on the backgrounds. My hope is sometime down the line is to go back, clean them up, and add more detail. Make them seem more 'lived in'. And that's a great point about the blending of the pages! I hadn't thought much about that but I think you're right! I previously worked on a black & white comic before this, where that wasn't much of an issue. Now that you mentioned it, I'm realizing it was something I should've paid more attention to in Space Pack!\nAs for the characters, so happy to hear you say that. The feelings you are having about them are perfect, just what I'd hope for! Also awesome you find the 90s aesthetic not too overwhelming.

","['Not bad but this would count for a draft. Working in layers is easier in digital art and I think most people prefer it. Keep making improvements in layers so that the final inking is smooth. May I know what program you use and if you use a drawing tablet?', ""This is really good, given it's your first try! You have a lot of detail in there, and everything looks balanced and proportionate. The character has a gentleness about them which I really like.\nAre you using a drawing tablet, or an iPad with the Apple Pencil? If yes to either, I'd suggest setting your lineart brush to respond to pen pressure. That will allow it to change size, depending on how heavy you press. Lineart with some variation in width along each stroke usually looks better than lineart which is the same width the whole way along.\nIf you're using a mouse, firstly - WOW, secondly - get a cheap drawing tablet, it makes everything SO much easier."", ""Hey, that looks pretty good for your first digital drawing!\nOne thing I would recommend is the use of layers. I see some overlapping lines through the hair which you could erase, and by using multiple layers to draw your lineart the erasing of lines can be a bit easier as it won't affect your other lines."", ""I think that is a good start with the lineart, since the figure is quite clear and there aren't too many redrawn lines. To improve it, I would suggest you to erase some of the lines that go over the shapes, like with the side bangs and the clothes or the belt. Also, next time you could try to draw bits of the lineart in one single stroke, since it will make the line smoother and much cleaner. It might take longer since it takes a bit to get used to making one single motion and you would need to undo the lines over and over again, but the end result will be worth it!"", ""Thank you I wanted to try a drawing of one of my main characters and I think if you said he had a gentleness around him I managed to capture the idea.I bought a cheap drawing tablet and that's what I used to draw this. But since I'm not familiar with brushes and stuff I'm not sure what would look good for lines so I just found one that drew an easy straight black line and used that but I do agree, one that swings and reacts to the pressure sensitivity would probably be better."", ""Oh? I wasn't aware that it was still a draft but I will definitly continue trying to improve.I'm using Krita and a drawing trablet any tips your be appriciated.\nThank you for the feedback"", ""I tried using layers but I always forget I have them then start drawing on the wrong layer and do like most of the lines and then remember I'm on the wrong layer so I ended up with everything mix together on all the layers so I got really confused but I think this is something I can improve over time by getting more comfortable with the program"", ""I tryed doing the lines in one strock as much as possible since I heard about that before but I'm super insecure about my faces, hairs and hands so I always go back to smaller strockes to feel more assured.I will do my best to improve on that part and be more confident about drawing my lines in one go~"", ""I'm sorry for being so blunt  there. The lines are a bit shaky and overlapping. Layers and the stabilizer function will help a lot with that. I'd suggest looking up David Revoy's videos. He does great work and is one of the contributors for krita. Also did you go straight with the pen you used. I find using a softer pencil to make the general shapes and then making sharper lines layer by layer helps. You can use the lower layers as a guide and reduce those lawyers' opacity and maybe change the color of the lining for help.You are doing pretty well so a few tries will probably get you used to drawing digitally. With the colours basic color theory and figuring the lighting generally helps.\nDavid Revoy's site also has free brush presets and templates for download. His 25 brushes pack is . But depending on the version of krita you have, his brushes might already be available with the program."", ""Congrats on your first foray into digital art! I found the transition quite hard but ultimately worth it, you're off to a great start! I'm honestly impressed that this is your first piece. The overall composition is quite good, and those hands! You do quite well on a lot of common stumbling blocks (face symmetry, hands, proportions). I'll give a few suggestions but you should definitely be proud of your work!\nThere are a couple subtle things with the pose I would change, the left arm is too long (if you try holding something in front of your chest like he is, you'll see that your elbow naturally rests quite close to your side, if you move the elbow joint closer to his side and shorten the arm it will look more natural). Also the right sleeve looks a little off. Fabric is super hard to draw, and you've handled this billowing fabric quite well overall. My tip for this would be to consider where the arm is in the sleeve (even draw a rough sketch in a different layer to visualize). The way clothing hangs depends on what's underneath it. So for example these sorts of sleeves would probably be quite heavy, so you'd expect them to hug the top of the silhouette pretty tightly but hand down loosely below. I'm glad to hear you're already using references, they are your friend and can help tremendously!\nI will second what others say about the lineart, you want a brush with pressure sensitivity! It makes your work look way better without you really needing to do much different! I've never used Krita before, but looking at their brush page: https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/krita_4_preset_bundle.html1 the basic 5- Size default would do the trick. You want something that changes the size of your brush with pressure, but not the opacity for inking. Ideally pressure sensitivity works right off the bat in a program but sometimes you need to check settings for the program and your tablet. Also as sc101 says, pens will have a stability setting, which will automatically help make your lines cleaner. This isn't cheating, getting the tablet to respond to you properly can take some tweaking!\nMaking accurate clean lines is the hardest part of art (for me at least) so don't be discouraged that it isn't perfect! Making longer lines in a single stroke right off the bat is the right way to do this. It's painful and difficult to do, but you'll get a feeling for it, and it's better to avoid developing bad habits you have to break (I did micro overlapping lines for so long and it just... didn't look good haha).  Keep up the good work!"", 'Yeah, I get the insecurity for smaller areas like the face. Something that I do is that I do one line for one whole cheek, and then I follow it up with another smooth one for the forehead and so on. With the hair I try to draw my lines according to where the stress is, or how it would realistically flow. In general, look at your sketch and try to think about where you can break up the drawing in different lines and where you can clearly see a constant curve. I hope that helps!', ""Don't be sorry for being blunt~ that exactly why I uploaded this since I have no idea what I'm doing and criticisms helps me more than well-meant reviews.I did like four-five different drawings with a softer pen first since I saw that somewhere and it really helped but then when I got to the lines I started feeling insecure and I wasn't sure about how to divide layers and what to do with them exactly other than having my sketches on one and my lines on another but I started looking at some tutorials about layers and I'm now trying to use them more.I will definitely look up David Rovoy thank you for the tip.\nI will look up colour theory since I'm pretty sure the last time I heard that was in fifth grade drawing class and light is something I will need to watch tutorials on but I hope I can do good after taking some time with that\nThank you so much for the tip again~ I will look into those brushes and hopefully find one that works for the lines so they look better~~"", ""First of all, thank you~I used a lot of references and for the hands, I just looked up pictures of hands I like and mostly copied the shapes before finishing off with a few lines I commonly see in drawings since I feel no confidence in drawing hands it is mostly copying and refining pictures I found.For the face symmetry, I found tutorials that use a circle and then guidelines within and around that circle and that helped amazingly especially since I didn't build up the character from the inside but found a pose I liked copied that and then drew the character inside that pose because I don't think I would be able to get the proportions right if I did it the other way round.The thing about the arm getting shorter I found out about that today in a tutorial I watched about something called foreshortening (Not sure if that's written right) but I will have to go into that a lot more before I really understand it since it is a little weird. Thank you for pointing that out because I didn't realize it and have a lot of trouble with the whole idea.as for the fabric, I have no idea how it works I just look at other drawings with similar poses and similar clothing and mostly copied the creases so I will once again have to look into that but I will definitely try out your tip with drawing in the arm first to find out where the folds would go.\nThe line art and the need for the right brush is something I did research yesterday since a lot of people mentioned it. Thank you for the tip with the brush I will try it out and I will use the stabilizer to get better lines~ It might take some time to fully understand what is going on since the program has so many ideas but I saw some basic tutorials so it is easier to understand but digital art is really something you need to get into and research since there are so many small tips and trick out there that make things so much easier~\nThank you for the encouragement and I will definitely take the advice to heart and work on make longer lines~"", ""I'm not sure what stress means in this situation but the reast I do understand so I will try and follow that idea~\nMaybe the next try looks better~~"", 'I took everything into consideration and did another linework try hope this is a little better\n\nFirst try extended linework.jpg1200x2000 103 KB\n', 'Keep at it! I think there are some nice improvements here, the left hand looks very nice to me, and this brush looks less pixelated and shaky.  The more you do it the easier it will get. It\'s great you\'re watching a lot of tutorials and trying to improve quickly, just don\'t overwhelm yourself! The point of art is to be fun after all, so if you\'re getting bogged down by all the rules, take it slow. Same with color. There are rules and guides, but just exploring and expressing your character, and you will start to learn that basics and what you need to improve. Better to draw something ""bad"" but get experience and enjoyment, then perpetually waiting until you\'re ""good enough"".

Dragens Den | Tapas
A tale of a young dragon who escapes the clutches of a tyrant who seeks to use his power for evil. Leaving his child hood companions and becoming homeless, he meets all these friends and allies as he discovers all the dragons of the world and works...





","['So right off the bat, there were a few things that threw me off about your comic, and why I wouldn\'t continue reading it if I was someone who had just discovered your comic.\n1) It starts out very slow. Like, nothing really genuinely happens for several pages. The first page only even has one line of dialogue, with the character introducing himself, and I honestly thought you just misspelled the word ""dragon,"" not that the character\'s name is Dragen. Most readers on Tapas will give you about three or four episodes to hook their interest, and if you don\'t do that, they\'re usually just going to move on and find something else.\n2) A dragon named Dragen is a bit outside my suspension of disbelief. Like, would you have a human character named Hyuman? Or an elf character named Elff? It feels a bit like when a six year old is telling a story about a cat and can\'t come up with a name, so they name it Cat. It would be fine if you were doing a story for children, but...\n3) Your idyllic, peaceful, childish cartoon dragon with his lovely little slice-of-life introduction lies to the reader about the kind of story they\'re about to read. The intro reads like a children\'s book about a cute dragon named Dragen, and then suddenly characters are getting into fights and tied up and there\'s blood, and it\'s very incongruous.\n4) On a comic-specific note, it can be hard to tell what\'s going on because almost all of your shots are close-ups and extreme close-ups. There\'s no way to know where the characters are, what the environment they\'re in looks like, or where they are in relation to each other. You need to pull the camera back and have some establishing shots and full-body shots and varying camera angles so the reader can keep track of what\'s going on. A good rule of thumb is that (nearly) every episode should establish or re-establish the setting the characters are in and where they are in relation to each other.\nAnd lastly...\n5) The colored text on semi-transparent speech bubbles can be a little hard to read sometimes. If people have a hard time reading your text, they can\'t read your comic. End of story, no way around it. You need to make the dialogue as easy to read as humanly possible, which means don\'t get fancy with it. You don\'t need to use a different font and a different color text and a different colored speech bubble for every character. Black text on white speech bubbles is professional standard for a reason. \nAnyway, those are my thoughts. Granted, I didn\'t read the whole thing, but I feel like those are some of the barriers that might be keeping you from hooking new readers.', ""I read through the whole epilogue and part of chapter one. You have a good story idea. And you have a cute art style. But your story doesn't really match your art. The art says it's going to be a cute comic about a dragon that's targeted towards a younger audience. Your story on the other hand has dark tones and isn't suitable for most young audiences. I didn't finish the whole thing obviously because it's really not my cup of tea. I don't usually go for the cartoon looking comics. However, if you ever redid this with a more realistic or anime style, I'd probably read this for real."", ""1) Yea~ the reason he's named Dragen will be revealed in later chapters\n2) I did put in the tags that it is a PG13 comic, the style is just so it's pleasing to the eyes but its definitely not for kids\n3) I shall remember to lessen the close up shots in future episodes\n4) I only used the colored text for important characters. For other characters it'll be standard speech bubble.\nI appreciate the critique and will use them to better my comic."", ""I did put in the tags that its a PG13 comic, sadly Tapas doesn't have a way to show that before clicking it. I chose cartoon because it makes it easier to read, realism is not my thing and anime style would make it too complex. But for future episodes I will try and make it more obvious that my comic is not for kids"", 'Unfortunately, the way Tapas is set up, readers don\'t see the tags before they read it. You acknowledge that you know that, which means you should understand that the burden of letting readers know what they\'re getting into with your comic is on you. There\'s a writing philosophy that has been popularized by fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson, but it applies to every kind of writing, including comics, and it\'s called Promises and Payoffs.\nIn the first few pages of a story, a writer is (consciously or sub-consciously) Promising certain things to the reader. If the first few pages of a story set up that there has been a murder, and they need to find out Who Done It, then the promises made to the reader are that 1) the main character will discover clues to lead up to solving the murder, and 2) the reader will find out Who Done It. It is the job of the writer to then Payoff those Promises. If the right Payoff is not fulfilled for the Promises established, the reader is going to be feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied. So if the writer establishes that there has been a murder, and we need to find out Who Done It, but then the main character doesn\'t find any clues and we never know Who Done It, even if the rest of the writing is really well done, the reader is going to feel unsatisfied.\nLikewise, you spend the first several pages of your comic establishing a Promise to your readers, whether you planned to your not. The first several pages tell the readers that this is going to be a cute, sweet, idyllic slice-of-life story about a cartoon dragon named Dragen. The Promise you are making (intentionally or not) is that the rest of the comic is going to be a cute, sweet, idyllic slice-of-life story about a cartoon dragon named Dragen. When you suddenly shift gears to this dark and bloody story, you instantly break that Promise. And it doesn\'t matter if you intended to Promise that, because that is what readers are getting, and it\'s how they\'re interpreting it.\nThe biggest downside to doing this is you alienate every possible reader you might have. Anyone who starts to read this adorable cartoon slice-of-life story and likes it and wants to keep reading about this cute little dragon will be totally turned off when it\'s revealed that it\'s not the story they thought it was, and they\'ll stop reading. Conversely, anyone who is looking for a gritty, bloody, edgy story about fierce dragons fighting with each other is going to read the first few pages of your comic and think, ""Oh, this cute sweet slice-of-life story about a cartoon dragon isn\'t what I\'m looking for,"" and they\'ll stop reading before it gets to the part they would enjoy. Nobody wins!!\nI think the best thing you can do for yourself is find a way to suggest to the readers the kind of story they\'re getting themselves into VERY early into the comic. Honestly, the FIRST PAGE should tell readers what kind of story they\'re about to read. Whether it\'s a change in art style or a change in dialogue, or giving your peaceful Dragen wartime flashbacks or something, you need to let your readers know in your first 1-2 pages that they aren\'t reading a cute slice-of-life story about a cartoon dragon.\nYou of course don\'t have to listen to any of this if you don\'t want to, but you specifically asked for honest reviews to get more readers, and this is honestly why more people aren\'t reading your comic. And I think you\'ll find going forward as a comic artist that being able to receive and apply critique to your work is going to be one of the best skills you can learn. You obviously don\'t have to listen to every Joe Shmoe on the street telling you what to do with your comic, but if you are repeatedly getting the same feedback from multiple people, you might consider listening to those people. Likewise, if you get feedback from a professional freelance comic book artist working on their Master\'s in Sequential Art so they can teach people how to draw comics at the college level, it might be worth it to you to consider taking that advice, rather than dismissing or brushing off nearly every change suggested to you.\nOf course, if you\'re happy with what you\'re doing and the status of your comic and your readership, then feel free to keep doing things exactly the way you\'re doing them. Creating comics is a great hobby to have, and telling stories is good for the soul. If you\'re content with that, then by all means, ignore everything everyone is telling you and keep doing things the way you want to do them. But I would caution you against posting future ""Critique My Work"" threads if you\'re going to continue to summarily dismiss the critique you receive at your own request.', ""So I read through the prologue and through a few pages of the next chapter.Then i went over to chapter to see if some of my concerns where already adressed, and came back to write this.And here are my thoughts so far.\n1 - Your art style is cute, thought it can clash a bit with the overall heavy theme of the story... That is no nescessarily a bad thing, there a certain degree of 'softening blow' that comes from having a cute artstyle for a heavy and dark story (look at 'made in abyss' for some examples of that art being perfected). However my advice would be to figure out how to mash more seemingly those elements so that your story could shine through, Thing is, I know jack shit about drawing, so I can't help with how to do that..\n2 - I like the comedic tone on some of the scenes you make, you use a lot physical comedy which is generally a plus for me as I consider that one of the strenghts of comics and people really should exploit it more. Some scenes have a dark sense of humour to them (again that softening the blow thingy i mentioned), which helps set a tone.\n3 - My biggest issue... Pacing... The story just breezes through a lot! specially in the prologue (which i believe you should just call chapter 1), but it keeps moving and rarely slows down from what I caught... Thought I am aware we live in a world governed by speed, i'd say when it comes to entertainment we should remember to take a moment and just look at the flowers. Let me put it into perspective.First he is bored and sad reminiscing of the past, that part is ok.Then we see what happened in the past, but again little to no moments in which we can understand him, he is mostly reacting to things being done to him and his friends, so far we know he is protective of his friends and generally easy to upset, but that's it, that's all we got.then when he wakes ups he suddenly decides to go and find his friends, thing we are told he hasn't bothered with doing in 5 years, what changed? Other than plot convenience... Nothing.Then he gets into the accident and is being taken care of by the girls who are now characters and are going out of their way to help, but we don't see why either... We see them already being bffs with him, but not much else is explained.\nI know it might sound like i'm being harsh, but i'm actually enjoying it so far, I just wished we had more connection to these characters, 'show don't tell' only works if you do show it somehow, and if you don't have the time for it, maybe telling is the way to go.Without those moments to estabilish them, it feels like the protagonist is just getting rolled over to the plot with no agency of his own, and the rest of the cast is there to service him... Part of that is because of the amnesia trope, the character itself has no idea where to go, but the way you solve that is through hinting it to him and him going to check it out.Like... Imagine how different it would feel if instead he found something of his friends that lead him to want to search for them again? Or if rather than just straight up going to the library he instead asks to chill with these new characters for a while, before he finds something else to help trigger his memory and then decide to go there to check it out (and they help because they had already been helping him and now they are invested)? It would feel like he is in control of what is happening, even if he is not in control of himself, and that would feel more engaging.\nI did sub, I will read the parts I skipped and follow you up,  ^^hope I wasn't too harsh."", ""If you want critique on your own comic, you really shouldn't hijack someone else's forum thread to do it.

171,Feedback On Cover Please?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I had this cover made a while back by a good horror writer friend on Wattpad a year or so ago. While I absolutely love it, I wonder if it's making the dog seem more like the main character. Which isn't the case. Rocco is important to the story, but he's not the center of attention in this story. And I wouldn't want to be misleading. I'd love any thoughts you might have. If you're not a fan of the cover I have now, what do you think I should change it to? If you feel like this cover is fitting, then maybe I'm concerned over nothing! 
Here's a summary of the story I've yet to publish to give you an idea what it's about: 

Digging up the truth and saving lives is what police officer Adrian Lindel and his K9 partner, Rocco, do best.
On a warm summer night, two young women go missing in the quaint town of Crittendale County, Colorado. Officer Lindel’s tasked with finding Laurel and Hannah, but his search leads him down a rabbit hole full of secrets the girls kept from their loved ones. No matter what he finds, officer Lindel’s determined to bring the girls’ back home safe and sound.
Kazimir Ivánovič Vassiliev is given a second chance at life when he finally leaves the Voiceless Rebels gang. The Lindel family agrees to help him on one condition. He has to get clean and kiss his precious cocaine goodbye. But staying clean won’t be easy for Kazimir. Helping officer Lindel find his missing rehab friend, Hannah, won’t satiate his cravings for long either.
Can they help uncover the secrets around the young women’s disappearances? Or will the criminal outsmart them all?

I'm happy to hear you like it."", ""I am getting Stephen King's Cujo vibes from the cover, especially since you also mentioned horror.

Also with the tape you could flip the angle so it starts higher and ends down, that way it subconsciously helps guide your eyes from the title downwards to the image and then to your name at the bottom. \nMost crime novels use a simple sans serif font similar to the one your name is written in but i think a font similar to the one you have could work if you removed the gradient and black border so it’s plain white (since white is high contrast the border isn’t necessary unless the text was on a pastel background). Personally i find the E’s in the current font a little awkward to read with how the lines cross through both sides but i definitely like the idea of a more graphic style font \nDafont is a great site for free fonts - just if you have plans to sell or monetise the novel check the licensing terms for the font you choose as some require a fee for commercial use']",3/22/2021 20:46,https://forums.tapas.io/t/feedback-on-cover-please/56557,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
172,Would anyone be interested in a workshop group?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I know a lot of people look for feedback on their projects here, and maybe looking for a community of artists and writers to hang out with, too. So, I thought of something that may be a little different than what has been done on here before?
I always really enjoyed my workshop classes in undergrad and grad school, so I thought maybe I could put something similar together for anyone who is interested. 
My thought is that once a week, we can all post something we want feedback on. It could be a whole chapter, a single scene, etc. (Though, I would suggest a max word count of maybe 5,000 or something that we can always determine later).
Basically, you would have a week to read someone's post and offer constructive feedback. Depending on the amount of people that want to do this, I may make it required that you respond to a set number of posts in order to make it fair. If you want to post, you have to be willing to read someone else's post, too!
This isn't necessarily a 'sub for sub' or anything like that. Of course, you can post a link to whatever it is your workshopping, but it's not meant to be a place to spam and promo. It's meant to give people who are serious about their work a chance to improve upon it and connect with other people, maybe make some friendships, etc.
We could even do more than workshop - play word games together, word sprints, share helpful resources, etc. 
So, I guess if anyone would be interested, let me know! And let's work to put something together! ","[""I'd be interested! I'm working on the first draft of a novel and would love a group to get feedback when I need it. Maybe a Discord server?"", ""I was definitely thinking Discord! But not sure how we could organize everyone's posts, especially if a lot of people were involved. I was kinda thinking forum styled?

175,Feedback on summary? Does this “hook” you in?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, 
I'm taking a plunge and decided to finally write my story. Out of curiosity, (and since my story is in a more malleable stage) I would like to know if you came across this summary on Tapastic - would you check out the first chapter? I know it's playing on a lot of cliche tropes - but I like those tropes  
(Genre: fantasy/romance; first POV; Female protagonist)
Summary: 

My name is Clara Whitten, and I died as an unremarkable person. The last thing I could recall before my untimely death were the bright headlights, screeching tires, and perhaps my last breath. I couldn't help but laugh that my last day on Earth was closing up shop and getting hit by a car while crossing a sidewalk. I suppose I had a good run - at least, the proof that I had existed will be written as part of a statistics on the number of deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents. 
So, why did such an unremarkable person like me wake up in a saintess' body? Well, you won't see me complaining since a life of nothing but success awaits me, right? That's what I thought before I realized that I had no agency over this body and everytime I die, I go back in time reliving this nightmare over and over again.
","['I like the style of this blurb a lot more than the blurb itself. This would be great text for a prologue, but you\'re gonna want your story\'s ""gimmick"" to appear in your blurb as soon as possible. The thing that gets readers not just thinking about your story, but excited to read it. You might have to forfeit the elements of surprise and suspense to do that.\nSo a better start, in my opinion, would be more like, ""How did Clara wind up in a saintess\' body? And is this a dream come true, or a nightmare she\'s doomed to repeat, again and again?"" But that\'s just a start and a draft.\nIt would probably be helpful to add another detail or two about your story setup -- not enough to reveal everything, but enough to make your audience stop and say ""huh, that\'s cool, there are a lot of possibilities with that setup.""\n(also, a note: even if the story itself is 1st person, you don\'t necessarily need the blurb to be 1st person too...unless ya REALLY want to)', 'I was struggling with the summary to see how much can I reveal and how much suspense I should add in.

The challenge from my point of view, is to tell the second paragraph without cliches. I don't know, maybe something along this lines:\n'My name is Clara Whitten, and I died as an unremarkable person.

177,Character Arc (“Healing” the Lone Wolf),Reviews | Feedback,[],"I want to know if this kind of arc is a good idea for a character actually present in the comic. He is actually a secondary character. I guess everyone remembers Levi from Attack on Titan 


Well, I mention him to get a better idea of this character's attitude after he changes for the first time.So, he starts as an average guy, nothing out of ordinary, he doesn't get featured a lot, only by the fact that he uses his telepathy a couple of times and hacks information at one point of the story. Then he gets kidnapped and this leads to his first change, he gets possessed and mentally tortured by a demon, trapped in agony for a while, and here is when I had two thoughts.

He dies during the possession.
He survives the possession but he becomes cold and distant, almost like he lost all happiness by that experience. he only thinks on be a better fighter, he becomes lonely and he can't even sleep for a long time because he is afraid to be trapped in his own nightmares again.

Also, he gets tortured and loses his wings in the process.
This makes him more suitable to make the hardest decision in various situations, he becomes almost the only character in the cast able to execute anyone who is a threat if is necessary, how he knows it is necessary? Because he still a telepath.
I don't know if is the right decision to leave him like that or involve him in the next situation, which includes a magical guy who got so upset about his lifestyle and guilt that he prefers to trap himself and everyone around him (including the telepath) in his utopian dreams, forcing everyone to be happy in the dream world while in reality, they are in danger of dying because they cannot wake up.
After this, he becomes more expressive, more empathetic, and more friendly.But I'm not sure yet, what do you think?","['Okay, so the problem with having a telepath on a team is that it can potentially make things too easy.\n""Is it okay to kill this bad guy? He\'s a human being after all, how do we not know he could be redeemed."" Is a question the heroes struggle with... except if you have a telepath they can turn around and say, ""Actually this person is a 100% irredeemable monster and I know this for certain because I have seen their thoughts and right now they are thinking only of pretending to be good while plotting to kill us all and strangle puppies for fun."" And the only way to avoid this is to make it so people can\'t completely trust the telepath not to abuse their power by lying about what they know. This is pretty much why Emma Frost is more liked by X-Men writers than Jean Grey; because while Emma is a powerful telepath, she\'s also kind of an anti-hero reformed villain and not a particularly nice person; she has her own agenda and it\'s much smaller and pettier than Jean\'s, which helps keep her under control.\nSo if you\'re keeping the telepath around and not killing him, the best thing you can possibly do is have him be damaged in a way that makes him unreliable so he doesn\'t ruin your story by easily revealing all the villains plots and removing any hard decisions. The character becoming withdrawn achieves this and makes sense. Being in the mind of somebody sadistically torturing you would probably make you scared to ever look into anyone\'s mind again, and seeing the evil that can exist in a person might make you feel just generally like people are awful and you can\'t deal with them.\nThe utopian dream could, while it\'s a danger, still have an overall healing effect by showing him that if their basic needs are all provided for, even people who seem hard and desperate can be nice and kind, making him realise the meaning of the phrase ""hurt people hurt people""; that bullies are usually people who have been bullied or made bad by desperate circumstances, and being kind to others can make them better.\nOverall, it\'s up to you. Think about the consequences of telepathy as a power and whether it\'s worth the hassle, and also think about whether this character is more meaningful to your story as a person who struggles with and then overcomes PTSD or whether they\'re more meaningful as a tragic death showing the human cost of the baddies\' plans and the life and death stakes of your story.']",3/22/2021 4:47,https://forums.tapas.io/t/character-arc-healing-the-lone-wolf/56449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
178,Feedback on Paragraph,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I need feedback on this paragraph. I am reworking ""The Mansion Mystery"" for my series. So far, Jamie is still recovering from the events in ""Frostbite"" and is feeling anxious about her return to the field. She is ""feeling"" better but her dad wants her to stay home longer. Does this paragraph work?
“I want to be useful,” she signed. Over the last year, Jamie had lost the man she loved, her hearing, the use of her arms, and even her leg. In between her therapy sessions, Jamie would sit at the computer, watching as the agents’ icons blink across the screen. Seven months ago, she had been one of those icons. Losing the right to go into the field was like losing her freedom. If she wasn’t free, she should still be trapped behind the Halliwell mirrors. A tear ran down her cheek. “I don’t want to be forgotten.”","['It reads nicely! Here\'s a few suggestions on my end: - Rearrange the mentioning of things she lost so it flows smoothy, going from ""the man she loved"", ""the use of her arms"", ""her hearing"", and then her leg. That way the subjects using the same possession indicators are grouped together. - For the part talking about how she watches the icons blink on screen, I suggest you change ""sit"" to ""stare"" to evoke more of a sense of longing and indicate how long she would stay there (unless the time between her therapy sessions been mentioned in previous paragraph).- Lastly is a small rewriting of that part as follows: ""In between her therapy sessions, Jamie would stare at the computer for hours on end. She was watching the agents’ icons blink across the screen, and to think she had been one of those icons just seven months ago.""\nHappy writing! I wish you luck with your story. ', 'I\'ve just got nitpicky things that ""I"" would do so... it might not be helpful.I\'m assuming you know about the typos but I\'ll put \'em in anyway \nfirst line: ""sighed"" \nSecond line: 1. I\'d drop ""even.""  2. I\'d also drop ""In"" between because somewhere someone told me ""in between"" should only be used for physical items otherwise it\'s kind of redundant.... and it haunts me now. 3. Instead of ""Jamie would sit"" try ""she sat"" for more immediacy, plus you\'ve already used her name once.(again a problem I have)\nThird line: ""watched the agents\' icons blink"" for more immediacy. (believe me, I\'m struggling with this right now myself so it\'s like at the front of my brain.)  I\'d consider starting a new paragraph at ""Seven months ago"" because it really (to me) solidifies that loss of freedom. Also in the line of ""seven months ago"" how about ""she was"" instead of ""she had been."" \nI don\'t understand ""If she wasn\'t free, she should still be trapped behind the Halliwell mirrors."" but I don\'t know what comes before this so that probably changes the meaning. right now, to me, the sentence doesn\'t make sense.  (but it is 11 and I\'ve been up since 5 am)\nSo if you actually like what I\'ve suggested it would read:\n""I want to be useful,"" she sighed. Over the last year, Jamie had lost the man she loved, her hearing, the use of her arms, and her leg. Between her therapy sessions, she sat at the computer watching the agents\' icons blink across the screen.\nSeven months ago she was one of those icons. Losing the right to go into the field was like losing her freedom. If she wasn\'t free, she should still be trapped behind the Halliwell mirrors. A tear ran down her cheek. ""I don\'t want to be forgotten.""', 'Judging it solely from the context provided, I like the way it reads.', '\n\ntherosesword:\nBetween her therapy sessions, she sat at the computer watching the agents\' icons blink across the screen.\nIn your rewrite, I\'d suggest saying ""Between therapy sessions"" because it\'s already obvious whose sessions they are. Watta you think? ', 'PS - If the author changes the paragraph much, I think they will want to revise the whole story to have the same tight & edited ""feel"". Could be a lot of work that ends up sounding like GRAMMARLY wrote it.', 'If that little bit changes what they do or their ""style"" and method, I don\'t advocate. As I told them... this is how I would do it. It wasn\'t how I would advise they do it. And, of course, without what came before and what came after this was a one shot. There\'s a fine line in editing where you destroy what you\'ve written. i\'ve only peeked at Grammarly and despised it for that specific reason.', ""I see a LOT of Grammarly ads on YouTube, and it almost always strikes me that I'd be a pretty disappointed employer if the person I hired to do writing & word-smithing wasn't able to express themselves as well on the fly (e.g., a conference room collaboration) as they did when they worked off their personal software."", ""I think it's good, there's just the tense issues and some misspellings that were brought up by others that stopped me in my tracks. Another suggestion you can feel free to ignore, is that visually this paragraph has a lot going on. It flashes back and forth from the present to the past, and my instinct is that it needs a paragraph break in there to make it clear that we're back in the present. If I were drawing this, I would not be able to do it in one panel--I would have to separate this into several panels, and that break in time would add more depth to what comes after it.\nBecause there's so many things happening the break could go in several spots, but for example I felt like this.\n“I want to be useful,” she signed. Over the last year, Jamie had lost the man she loved, her hearing, the use of her arms, and even her leg. In between her therapy sessions, Jamie would sit at the computer, watching as the agents’ icons blink across the screen. Seven months ago, she had been one of those icons.

If she wasn’t free, she should still be trapped behind the Halliwell mirrors.\nA tear ran down her cheek. “I don’t want to be forgotten.”\nBut I don't know what's happening around this paragraph so feel free to ignore me."", ""Thanks for the feedback suggestions everybody! The biggest element of this moment is her anxiety towards this HUGE life change and the lingering fear of being forgotten. *The Halliwell mirrors is a reference to another story where she was trapped behind the glass in a fun house mirror and her friends and family couldn't hear her scream.\nI've written a lot of this story but something felt off, so I'm doing a rewrite.\n@Ordinaryaverageguy I am with you about Grammerly. It's nice for a quick spellcheck but even working a corporate setting, it's not a game-changer."", 'Here is more of the scene to help give context to my sample paragraph.\n\n“Jamie,” said Cole softly, as they drove. The last traces of sunlight had disappeared over the horizon line. “Jamie, you got to talk to me sometime.”\n“Why?” she replied. Her eyes were fixed on the line of passing storefronts. The neon lights blurred into flashes of color as they passed. “I know what you’re going to say.”\nCole chuckled wryly, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. “And, what am I going to say?”\n“I don’t know,” she began. “Maybe… t-that I’m not good enough to be an agent. And that if I was more like Kendra or Anna, you’d want to be in the field with me…”\nCole pulled the car off onto the side of the road. “You couldn’t be farther from the truth, sweetheart.”\n“Then, what it is, Dad? Ever since I woke up, everybody treats me like I’m made of glass or a paper doll like Grandma Rosie used to make me.”\n“It’s got nothin’ to do with you.” Cole scratched his beard. “It’s me, I guess. I don’t know. You’re still recoverin’, Jamie Girl. What’s the rush to get back into the field, anyway?”\n“I want to be useful,” she signed.

","[""I did a quick overview of the summary and book cover (which is your first selling point to a new reader). I will say expand on the summary some more -- the stakes aren't properly shown and it's missing a hook. A hook is basically what makes someone interested in reading further in your story. A summary can have multiple hooks. You did already great with having little grammar issues and having a hooking question at the end of the summary. \nRegarding the book cover, the title is hard to read because it seems almost transparent with the background (I don't know whatever is done on purpose or not). However, I'm sure some artists on here take commissions to make a cover that fits your story more. Of course, this is merely advice and you can take it with a grain of salt."", ""Thank you so much, that is some great advice that should be relatively easy to implement too. I'm gonna see what I can change/add to the summary. \nThe cover is already a bit older, I think it's not very modern anymore and I should see if I can find anyone to help me out with that."", ""@Ninjaniksel You're welcome! Happy to help a fellow writer. It's simple advise but it can do all the difference (I experienced it myself when I began to understand how important a summary was). \nI hope you find someone how can help you, it's really difficult sometimes to find the right person for covers. Because one have to see whatever their style fits yours and so on."", ""What interests the reader is the front page (info page), the description and the first episode/prologue. The book cover does really interest me and the front page as a whole is alright to be honest. The description is good too, but, the punctuation and grammar does need to be a little adjusted for the desc and first episode. It's not a story that I would read, not because its bad or bad but because it's just not the genre that I would read. And that's the thing you just need to find the right viewers that would be interested in this type of story. I'm a type of person who likes comedy so from the first epsiode, I can already see that I wouldn't read it later on. But if a person who really likes fantasy and mystery clicks on your series, they would be eager to read the rest of your series. \nMy point is that you just need to wait for the right viewer to click on your series and then you would be satisfied with the amount of interactions you have with your episodes. It takes time, not everyone is a one hit star. I hope that I don't sound too harsh lol. Your novel is seriously not boring, I quite like it actually."", 'To add to all of this - you only started posting in January. It took me nearly half a year to break the 25 sub mark when I first started posting! Sometimes all you need is, well, time. I notice a decline from my prologue to my most recent chapters. I would think it’s quite common for books that don’t have a ton of subs. \nI read through your first few chapters. I like your concept! I think time will help - along with the other advice here. I realized when I drew art that looked more “comicy” for my novel - I gained more subs. That was before we were told to create book covers. But people do love that first visual (I’m guilty of this).', ""I've been planning to check out your novel for a while now. Will definitely try to get to it today finally. But something I've noticed on Tapas is that the first 3 chapters tend to have the most views. Heck, even just the first chapter usually has the most views. Maybe it's just super slow readers or a lot of users who just check out the first chapter. You'll get some readers who will want to read the entire story someday though. Just keep being active in the community and maybe find a beta reader if you're looking to polish up your work? I know those always helped me with my writing."", 'I think a lot of people click to see the first chapter or two to see if it is for them, and I think there are people who probably click accidently or just to get to the landing page and expand the description. I have an ""About This Story"" on one of my novels to explain the musical piece and really, there isn\'t anything there that should make someone NOT want to read it, but I lose a lot of people between that and episode one. It just wasn\'t for them. Then I lose about a third to a half? between episode one and two or three.\nI haven\'t had a chance to read yours yet (I\'m waiting on the book club ones ^^) but this is very common. Even if you look at popular ones, they\'ll lose half between episode one and episode two or three.

It sometimes took me a second to realize when they moved places or a flashback was starting. I feel like an easy fix is just adding more establishing shots. I know backgrounds are a pain but throwing the occasional establishing shot in there will not only help make your world feel more real, it will also help break sections up/indicate the location changes better. \nOverall, great work though, I think you're starting off strong!

Dragon X Rider | Tapas
In a remote mountainous valley, a young traveling mana-knight and her partner go head-to-head with an ancient white dragon.





","[""Hey, I checked out the comic. First of all: awesome job! I love the combination of the black and white monochrome color palette combined with the fresh cyan backgrounds, really makes the characters pop out of the page. And when the first yellow page appears? BAM, so visually neat!! The character design is unique and the perspective is chefs kiss, the only thing i would perhaps advise you on is to try and make the character a little less stiff. What can really help with that is sketching random poses from photo references.\nI love how you tell the story without words and convey emotions despite the characters' faces either being obscured or not humane. The action plays out so well, I think this short being animated would do it so much more justice than the limited comic format! I feel like the protagonist's face being very heavily anime inspired does not suit the rest of the art style all that well, but it was just that i expected something else, definitely not a mistake on your part! Perhaps you could try to study more realistic faces though, it really helps with adding uniqueness to the faces of your characters!\nI love the many many perspective shots and how you portray the action from all different sorts of angles, and they all look amazing, especially the aerial shots! The last shot is very lovely and comforting and gives of a lot of emotion, showing you can do other stuff than just action. I really enjoyed the read and will check out what you put out next, especially if you maybe study more about human anatomy and expressions. Amazing work and thanks for sharing it with us!! <33"", ""Thank you so much for the review! I wasn't even thinking about the posing but you're right, I definitely need to work on that. And while I do love drawing in a more anime-esque style, there's still alot of room for improvement on my facial expressions too. I'll be sure to pay more attention to these things in my next story.\nThanks again! "", 'Just finished reading Dragon X Rider. First things first, monochromatic comic with no dialogue is absolutely my aesthetic. Silent story telling is always interesting to me and I always up to reading stories that use it. Using blue for the sky and the Mana-Knight\'s eye is an (pun not intended) easy on the eye choice. I like to focus on Character Design since that\'s more my angle and only having 3 ""characters"" to focus on makes this simpler.\nMana-Knight: In full armor, I think it\'s solid. Simple but effective, I like how small and light she\'s designed so her Dragon partner doesn\'t have to carry more that it needs to. Something I would do is have a small design detail that\'s similar to their Dragon, either on the helmet or on shoulder. Something like a shared mark. Helmet-less, the blue-eyes are a nice touch. The best shot of her is that final hit near the end after closing in. Between her and her partner in that shot, that could be a great promotional illustration / cover.\nPartner Dragon: Looking at it for a second time, I didn\'t realize how small it actually was. The little detail on it, especially in the face, made it cute. The little bits of it\'s personality shown through it\'s actions were charming. Like with Mana-Knight, a little extra detail that resembled/complimented their Rider would be a nice touch.\nBell Dragon: I say Dragon, but it\'s more of a Wyvern. Good design difference between it at the Partner Dragon. Very large, imposing and battle worn, a clear danger to our main duo. Not much else to say, I like it\'s design a lot.\nOverall, fluid action, good use of the monochromatic art style, an easy and entertaining overall read. I like it! Good work, keep it up!', 'Hi! I really enjoyed the comic so I wanted to leave some feedback.\nI read it twice, and my first impressions: good setup for the story, with just enough environment shots. The limited colour scheme was great, and introducing different saturated colours later on really added some vitality to it, like having a different flavoured skittles candy piece. The action scenes were great, I can hear the explosions everytime I see the smoke clouds and play out the scene quite smoothly in my mind overall. The last panel was pretty special too, so wholesome! \nNow for the critique: I read it twice over because unfortunately I did not pick up on the significance of the bell the first time; I was on mobile so it appeared small to me and I glazed over it because the two panels were grouped close together? Gestalt! \nThere were a minor few points in which the immersion was lost for me because I was trying to figure out what was happening in the panel and it’s mostly due to technical issues like contrast and clear drawings in general. For example, I was confused with panel 5 -it appeared to me a giant hand as its size in relation to the background rocks is similar. It could also be fixed by adding a blade of grass or something else in the foreground piece just to compare. Another is panel 24 with the whistle - the background value in grey is almost, if not the exact same vaue as the armor and I had difficulty reading the image. Finally, as pointed out earlier - anatomy is tough so I’m absolutely overlooking those areas because I know you’ll improve in the future as you keep practicing!  Mine’s not perfect either anyway haha. \nMy favourite panels: 12-13 (in case it’s not the correct number - the knight getting ready to draw the sword, I just reeally like the perspective and how you used shadow!). Panel 43 (the bright orange and purple, lettering), and finally panel 56 (knight on the dragon with smoke in the bg. The lineart here is stronger and defined here in comparison to the rest, also I like that the colours are desaturated and coloured greys rather than total greyscale) \nSo overall, my suggestion is to take note of the clarity/readability with individual panels and its values and contrasts. Keep it up and thank you for sharing your hard work, I enjoyed it a lot!', ""Thank you for taking the time to read and review Dialusion! I'll keep your advice in mind and try to consider how my character designs complement each other in future projects "", ""Thank you for your review, ChaiKat!

Omg you've all bene so nice and all your critique points are totally valid (obviously) and this has been such a great way to isolate the features of my art I need to focus more on (like colours and values, I've only done digital art for a year and I'm only now starting to grasp how to colour), I initially made this thread to see the range of response types but you've all just been so nice and genuine...

Note the discount part is you not being Sir Quentin Blake.', ""i think my only critique would be the line weights in the second picture, a lot of secondary detail and/or little rough dots are thicker sometimes than the objects that they are drawn on, like the door's shading is thicker than the door's lines itself. \nsame with the dots on the street, they're thicker than the white lines and its a bit contradictory in which details are seen as more important.otherwise i love it!!!"", ""TBH I love that your line quality and loose approach creates a really gestural story. Gives it a lot of life and action. Like I wish more comics could just let go like this without analyzing and perfecting every detail. I wouldn't really want you to change anything--probably not the roast you were looking for, but it's a comic! Perfection is not necessary, it's about storytelling, and you've found a style that is quick to do and still pleasing to the eye. I do like the second one better, but that's more because of the contrast and composition that draws my eye in.\nMy only critique is that the first one has areas of coloring that look kinda digital--like the blending of the couch is a little messy in a way that doesn't read like brush strokes. The rest of it has a traditional and vintage illustration feel, so that little bit where I can tell it's a digital brush going over the edges was a little off.

That\'s just the only roast I could think of 🤣)', ""gunna go the constructive route (or so i hope) but here's my attempt:\nthe sketchy style works well for your art though there are definitely some places that could use a bit more variation in thickness so to keep your characters, foreground and background from mixing all to much (more for the b/w drawing than the other as the color variation + gradient helps divide things)\nthe only other thing i could maybe think of is maybe cleaning up a few strays where tangents might be created, again for clarity of image and to help the eyes know where to focus, but uh other than that i'd say the arts good "", '\nimage.png1132x696 610 KB\n', 'A lot of the elements are competing for my attention so I find myself darting around the images a bit.', ""Im not nearly witty enough to make a roast of your work.\nI guess I will try some form of analysis- but really its hard to be critical of someone who clearly has a well developed style already  \nI know most people dont like the sketchy style but I personally love the first panel, it gives me a nostalgic feeling of the Zits comics which my mother always used to read so I really can't think of anything negative to say about it \nI suppose the only critical thing i can think of is for the second picture which is very bold B&W And as where i Enjoy most B&W i feel if i was reading an entire comic like that my astigmatism would act up and start causing me to see double vision. But that's a personal medical issue so hard to really place that on any real critique spectrum \nEither way they're both very well done ^^ you have a very distinct style that I like"", ""whats there to roast, it's really good art, you have your style down to a T"", ""I can't roast this! Your style is so pretty and personal! These are sketches but I guess that a clean drawing would remind me a bit of the comic Cybersix!

I take them for what they are, which is an incomplete work but pleasant to the eye"", ""Ohhh I love the sketchy lines. I also like how you draw hands. It adds a nice stylization that makes your drawings super cute.\nOne thing you could consider is adding more contrasting values? Both the top drawing and the bottom are very well done, but everything in the drawing has been given the same weight so things kind of blend together.

187,Please give me brutally honest feedback,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'm the creator of a series called Plot Armor Academy50 and have a very specific request.
To anyone who graces this sub thread with their presence I would like to give the task of reading as far as you get (or want to) and be as harsh and honest as humanly possible with your feedback.
A bit more about the comic:It's a vaguely educational series in wich a background characters attempts to become the protagonist of their own series by attaining plot armor from the ably named ""Plot Armor Academy"". They get some help along the way from an academy dropout and failed attempt at a protagonist.Any and all feedback may (or lets be honest here, most definitely will) be turned into actual plot points.Especially thorough criticism will be made into its own arc with possibilities for a collaboration, if the commenter is willing to allow it.
Pull no punches here.If you think my art sucks, let me know but try to mention what you hated the most.In case you don't like a specific character, tear them a new one in written form.The story not to your liking? Good, make a rude comment telling me why.
Don't feel obligated to give me examples on how to make it better, or the need to play humble because you think your own work is, for whatever reason, not as good as mine.I believe every person, no matter their skill level can have some form of useful insight to provide, even in the form of a rude comment.
So yea, here's another link that should also show the thumbnail:

Plot Armor Academy
Plot Armor Academy is the only place fictional characters within the metaverse can go to earn their plot armor. The comic follows Kate, the daughter of a newspaper add and a magical girl mascot, on her journey to becoming a true protagonist ......





","['Looks fine to me, honestly.', 'Okay, here is my honest opinion:\nThe overarching theme in all my critique is going to be this: Do less. Be a little more minimalistic. Use fewer words. Utilize white space. \n1) If I were just scrolling around, I wouldn\'t click on your comic because of your thumbnail and your story description doesn\'t engage me. The picture doesn\'t seem to match the description and I\'m just overall very confused on what the story is about. From the thumbnail I\'d guess it\'s some kind of sci-fi psychedelic thing. But then the story description is about newspapers and something called plot armor? I have no idea what ""earn their plot armor"" means but not in a ""oh I\'m curious"" kind of way but in a ""i\'m not willing to expend the mental energy to figure out what this person means and move on"" kind of way\nFor your story description, one sentence, maybe two, at most is all someone quickly skimming by wants to read. ie: Kate, the daughter of a _____, faces < problem > on her journey to becoming a true protagonist. (Although I don\'t like this ""true protagonist"" thing still because I have no idea what this means.) \n2) Once I clicked on the comic, I saw that you have a prologue. Which made me groan because I kind of hate prologues. This is a personal opinion, but most of the comics that have them are either 1) poorly done 2) unnecessary 3) both. \n3) However, I wanted to try and give the comic a chance since you asked for feedback, so I clicked on the first episode, and I couldn\'t get past the first panel because the lettering is so difficult to read. The font itself is not a good one (choose something more simple!), plus the varying font size, some of it in all caps, some of it not, the sheer amount of words and the strange speech bubble shapes just overwhelmed my eyeballs. \n4) I think your art is really clean, but the comic lacks polish and professionalism. I recommend you read and follow this13 and look at some of the other resources that webtoons have for creators. Also, if you look up Walter Ostlie on Youtube he has a lot of great advice for comic creators. Definitely watch his video on lettering! \nGood luck!\nEdit/ Also it\'s natural for comics to improve, but consider updating the first three episodes with the improved art/lettering and an author\'s note that explains the change. Otherwise, you might get new readers that won\'t give the comic a chance even though the art has improved a lot.', ""Now that's what I'm talking about! And I respect your effort in suffering through my comic ^^\n1) That one almost hurt. I actually spent time making the thing, but oh well, back to the drawing board I guess. It actually was supposed to be some kind of sci-fi psychedelic thing, so at least I've got that going for myself. Too bad my plot synopsis still sucks. Tried re writing that thing multiple times but it never ends up making any sense. Comes with the premise I guess.\n2) I renamed the first and second chapter to prologue just to mess with people, because I too hate prologues quite a lot. But they're kind of like establishing shots. It gets even more confusing without them. (Naruto has a prologue that used to play at the beginning of each episode btw, just saying.)\n3) this one is just a, you're right, moment. redoing that part is gonna be an absolute nightmare if I don't restart the whole series though. I shot myself in the foot pretty hard by using page format first. But threat not, I am already at least rewriting it. Pressing the reboot button doesn't hurt as much if I never get any readers in the first place.\n4) Regardless of what I think of our friend Walter (cough basic cough) he has something vaguely informational to say once in a blue moon. I cannot overstate my non ironic joy for the fact we both agree on my lettering being utter garbage. Thumbs up there.\nFrom the edit I can tell you may have even red a little past the third episode. My condolences. And thank you for your time. You are the MVP I needed.\nEDIT: How do you not know what plot armor is? I mean, yea you can write it as plot ARMOUR as well but ... deamn. sigh maybe I should explain what it is within the plot synopsis for the ... uninitiated? Thanks for showing me that not everyone is in the know."", ""Here we go.\n\nSummary is too wordy. Remove the explanatory stuff and give us a hook that sparks interest. Usually a question to be answered if we read it, an important/catchy quote from a character in the comic, etc. Also, remove the (I hope) in parantheses since that shows uncertainty and unprofessionalism.\nStoryboarding. You've already improved your formatting for webtoons in the later episodes, so I'm going to critique your latest episode. There are many small things you could do for better readability. For one, your bubbles are gigantic and cover up the panels too much, when the artwork should be the bigger focus in a webcomic. You're not writing a novel. Either that, or your bubbles aren't even attached to the relevant panel it's from.\nacademy critique.jpg800x1920 691 KB\n\nacademy critique2.jpg800x1418 593 KB\n\n"", 'Another masterpiece, this time with visuals. Fancy.\nThis feedback is on a level of detail I didn\'t think possible. Definitely gonna turn those into plot points.I salute you good sir. Excellent insight!\nI\'m terribly sorry to impose, but would you glance at this here new version of the synopsis and tell me if it\'s more catchy to a potential new reader?\n""What if all the characters you created were alive?Where do they learn to behave like comic book characters rather than just regular people? How do they get their plot armor? You know, that thing that makes them too important to die.Well, you found the place.\nUpdates on THURSDAY""\nThank you so much for your time.You are a true protagonist!\nEDIT: Did you re do the shading in that last panel? How do you even begin to be this awesome?', 'New synopsis is catchier.\nIt could be cut down even further so the readers have room to make the questions themselves.--They say that you are the protagonist of you own story, but that is not true at all. Some of us struggle, nameless, faceless, and gone within pages.\n""Easy for you to say, Main Character.""\nIt\'s time for the background character to take control of their own fate.--\nFirst section provides context.Second section shows off the personality of an unknown character you might be curious about. A line yet to be said in the story.Third section provides determination. The spark for the plot to take off right away.\nYes, I did shade over your last panel. I chose darker colours.', 'Woof, this took a lot longer than I thought, but better late than never! Here is some honest reaction/feedback. I’m an artist that reads a lot of comics but not a writer for whatever that’s worth.\nBased on title, I assumed this is pitched at a snarky/comedy shounen audience. Having read it, I think that checks out… mostlyish. Looks like you got some feedback on your summary and it is much better than before. The “What if all the characters you created were alive?” doesn’t quite fit for me, because it implies alive in a normal world. Also not a huge fan of summaries that are a bunch of questions – one or two for hook, yes, but I think it pays to think about who will enjoy your comic and just tell them what they\'re getting into, so they can get into it.\nNew thumbnail is much much better than old thumbnail, but still not as good as it could be. I think it’s quite aesthetically pleasing actually but unfortunately a bit busy/low contrast/low saturation for getting attention among the other thumbnails.\nThe font is too small to read on a phone at first – looks like you got feedback on this. I’m not a huge fan of the font itself – I don’t think it matches up with your art style but I stopped noticing that I didn’t like it pretty quickly. Initially I had to work following the order of speech bubbles but they became much more clear/less dense as the series went on.\nThe art I really like – I’m into those chunky lines and stylized faces and your colors are nice once you added them. Lots of love for Jeremy in ""Experiment 0"" where he looks extra super cool. I’m also a fan of the cat! Looks fantastic :3. I think I like that the art keeps changing but retains underlying consistency, if that makes sense. Your environments are usually solid and match with your art, but there are some panels where you don’t have one but drew attention to it by making it a dark flat gray and adding just enough detail that it felt like there should be a bg but there wasn’t (I’m thinking particularly of the scene right before Kate/Marshmellow gets her letter). There’s some in #25 where characters are talking and it’s gray behind them – what you did in #26 looks way better.\nI found I had a hard time connecting with your characters because there is so much going on world-wise. Meta-ness breaks immersion and I spent more time contemplating the “rules” or rulebreaking of your comic world than getting to know Kate and caring about what happens to her. At the end of reading, I still don’t feel like I know her very well – what she stands for or what I expect she might do in a given situation or even some unique quirky behavior/trait that could help me connect with her more. I got that she wanted to get into school and be a protagonist but it felt like she is a passive character once she’s there, which isn’t super engaging for me.\nI came to like Jeremy the most but I couldn’t remember his name without checking. I think his combo of protectiveness but slightly a-hole behavior was endearing – I like those characters that give out unwanted nicknames but also watch out for people. His presence in the gutters with commentary was always welcome (and missed when he wasn’t there haha).\nSecond favorite character is the scratchy blanket guy – I enjoyed him being an arse.\nI didn’t find the Dr. Gray arc super compelling and I think the comic picked up a lot once you got Kate into a room with the other students. \nOverall, interesting premise and good art but the focus on clever/interesting ideas overwhelmed the characters for me.\nHope anything here is helpful!', 'Hell yea that was helpful ^^\nStill gonna work on the synopsis based on that feedback. Also the thumbnail. That could use some work. Need to do some research and maybe wait another month or so before changing it again.\nKate being seen as a passive character right now is actually quite good. That tells me I set up the ""become a more active protagonist"" ark kind of correctly.\nI picked the name Jeremy based on the fact that it is the least fitting/memorable name for an OP character I could come up with ... So someone telling me they couldn\'t remember it without having to check is also great to be honest.\nThat being said, I think I\'ll take away from this that I need to do more with the interpersonal connections between the characters and reveal the world at a slower pace. \nThank you for your time and detailed feedback.\nPS: That cat\'s ark / c-plot is gonna be incredibly fun to draw ... will probably also piss off ... like so many different people.

As a reader, it\'s really hard to read when all the dialogue is smushed up into just one big paragraph. I suggest that you space out your dialogue into separate paragraphs so it\'s a lot easier to read. For example (and this is just an example I came up with on whim): \n""Hi, my name is Phaz."" he said reaching his hand out for me to shake.\n""I\'m... Atena.""\nAlso, it\'d be great if you could go in-depth with the scenario, like explaining what the portal looks like or what Atena\'s room looks like. It just sort of seems like you\'re listing out the dialogue and actions your characters are doing. I feel like your story could be more engaging if you could be more descriptive with what they\'re doing, how they\'re feeling with the situation, things like that. \nOverall, from what I\'ve read, it\'s a pretty interesting start!']",3/5/2021 17:17,https://forums.tapas.io/t/feedback-on-my-fanfic-novel/55886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you in advance.","[""Not primarily a writer, so take everything with a grain of salt. Most of this is just reactions.I like seeing how the blade is affecting Ine and how her personality and mannerism change with its influence. I also like having the creatures described since I don't know much about West-African stories or the beings in it. I'd almost want more of a description so I can fully visualize it, but that's just my quirks.Speaking of quirks, having Ine blurt out foreign words at times is an interesting one. I can assume it's fully explored later as the story unfolds.If each chapter introduces a new creature for Ine to be challenged by, it could be a fun way to explore West African culture, but that's assuming you want to turn this into a monster-of-the-week story for the first few chapters. Chapter 4's final paragraphs was the most interesting to me, but that's just from my own tastes. I love how raw and primal it got, to contrast the tone of the rest of the story. Bits like that sprinkled around sparingly could definitely intrigue readers. \nHopefully you found some value in my ramblings."", 'Thank you for taking out your time to read the story.

","[""This is really good! A few pointers:\n\nThe word 'crystals' is bound to make people's eyes roll back out of boredom. Try something like 'it's a new element', and then give that element a name.\nYour work is too good to be using Anime Ace font. Try something that fits your cyber theme a little better, and matches your aesthetic.\nDon't post the cover on every chapter, and tighten the size of your links at the bottom.\nIn the second part of Chapter 1, the shot where the armed guard aims his gun at the other guys, it looks way too traced. It needs to blend in with the scene, not have the darkest lineart.\nYou chose to introduce the characters in the first scene, which was good. But it's tough to believe they'd be running around without armor being all cool and quirky and likeable when EVERYONE ELSE needs armor. It worked for Star Wars because they couldn't afford it, and when they found it, they put it on. It doesn't work here because they come out of a dropship, and their benefactors look loaded. This would be an opportunity to show character through:\nDistinctive armor sets\nActions instead of words\nMotions instead of faces.Now's the time to really show who these people are by the way they FIGHT, not the way they talk. There's time for that later.\n\n\nAss shot at the end of Part 2 is a little unnecessary. You can save that stuff for pinups and charge for it. Bling! Always better to ask your fans to pay for that kind of gratification when it isn't the main focus.\nIt looks like your inspiration may have been Kill La Kill, and similar anime or manga. I'd recommend really getting to know THEIR inspiration, too - for KLK, that means cowboy films, samurai black-and-white movies, and basically any crime film by Quentin Tarantino or from the last half-century. It'll pay off.\n"", 'Thanks for all the feedback! \nI will say that I am not the artist so some of those thing all have to relay to them. I write, script, storyboard, and design characters. \nThe crystals is definitely a played-out trope. Kinda spoilers but the crystals are actually more ""containment pods"" for something similar to what you described. It\'s what is inside the crystals not the crystal itself which is what\'s explored more. \nI was debating having a title page for each chapter so I\'m glad you gave feedback on that. \nThe main reason for the clothing is that armor like that isn\'t really normal. It\'s strictly a military thing in this scene but I do get what you\'re saying. The soldiers don\'t have power so that\'s more of the reasoning for it. \nI actually haven\'t watched Kill La Kill but I\'ll have to look into that.

196,Nearly halfway done my comic. Wouldn’t mind some general feedback and if you want I can give you some as well on your own story?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So I wrote this story ""Happy Pines17"" a little while ago and since then my artist and I have been working on getting the pages fully drawn. At this point, we are nearly halfway done so some general feedback on what we could fix or just what you think in general would be much appreciated. Also if you want I can check out your work as well if you're also looking for some input from an outside source.
Here's the basic description ""Ash and Karen return to work at the Happy Pines Campsite a few weeks after a gruesome attack by what officials believe to be some kind of animal killed a group of campers. What will Ash find as she tries to uncover the truth and who exactly is the mysterious Artie who showed up on-site?""
Thank you so much and if you leave a link to your story I'll try to get to it when I have a chance through the day!","[""Well, I like the fact that updates are quite juicy. There's a good amount of dialogue to read and none of it seems unnecessary. You're taking your time unravelling the story but the pace is good. The art style is very Occidental but I see some japanese influence, if I'm right. It's nice, I like it, though it's a bit dirty in the coloring (the blonde girl - Karen, I think - is my favourite so far). Some background perspectives are kinda iffy but I suck at background and I know well how hard it is to draw them so I won't complaint that much. Right now everything is centered around the plot so there isn't much characters development. We don't know much of the main cast at the moment. Overall it seems an interesting story and you're putting a lot of work in it. At the same time, at the moment, it also seems very typical.  It doesn't dare to break established routines.It's worth reading anyway"", 'Hey, thank you I appreciate your feedback! I appreciate it!', 'I\'ve read through what you have up so far, and it\'s looking like a good set-up. Some thoughts:\n\nArtie didn\'t originally seem to be behaving that oddly to me? He just struck me as an excited camper until he insisted on diverging during the nature walk.\nThere are a few panels - commonly the first in an episode starting at #7 - where the text is extremely small. I\'m on desktop and still had to zoom in, even though there was plenty of blank space so it could\'ve been a normal size. Just keep that in mind and be sure you keep the text at a fairly consistent size.\nA lot of comics I read will have funny little comments in the descriptions, which I quite enjoy. Obviously that\'s not actually a part of the comic, but it lets the author\'s personality show through, I think, and helps endear you as an author to your readers, which could be helpful regarding ink and such. Currently, you have pretty cut-and-dry summaries of the episodes. I would suggest making them more like you commenting on the episode, judging the characters\' actions, etc.\nSpell check. I found Minnesota spelled ""Minisota,"" then immediately followed by the correct spelling.\n\nThat said, the actual story line is definitely interesting and I think the pacing is good. Some more character development would be good, like MTDG said. I agree that Karen is my favorite so far, though Artie seems like he could be fun as well. I\'m a writer, not an artist, but the art is solid and pretty clear about what\'s happening. Curious to see where you take it!\n(Sidenote: I just realized I read the whole thing without liking any of the episodes; I\'m gonna go back and do that now. I did actually read them at a normal pace and am not just spam-liking  It bugs me when that happens so just wanted to clarify)\nI\'d love some feedback on my novel if you\'re game!

I\'ll probably have to take a look at the text size, one of the issues is we make it in a traditional comic layout and then splice it up into separate panels so sometimes the bigger panels have some smaller text. I\'ll also have to up my description game it seems lol. Lastly, Minnesota will be the death of me lol, I for some reason can never catch that word when it\'s misspelled.\nOkay now onto your story! I overall really enjoyed it, each page left me wanting more information and I found the dynamic between the two girls to be really interesting. Initially, I had assumed that Margarita was just getting over a bad breakup or something but as the story went on I found myself more and more interested in her past with this Issac guy as well as her relationship with her mother. Mitta is an interesting character two, she seems to have a lot of cash which I really wanted to learn where that all came from as well as the origin behind her name. All in all really interesting stuff and I\'m interested in seeing how the plot progresses. One thing I did notice on the first page that I think either a typo or my brain is too tired to register it properly but it looked like the quotes ended at the wrong area """"...but I do have a car. Good Lord,"" how stupid could I have been"" here.', ""That makes sense for the text size. I had a feeling that might have been the reasoning behind it, and best of luck with Minnesota. I've recently learned that I apparently can't spell 'marveling' to save myself (I'm determined to use two Ls), so we all have those words.\nThank you! I appreciate the feedback. That quotation end was actually intentional; the idea was to show her thoughts continuing into the next phrase even though she stopped talking out loud. Did it work?

199,"Need feedback and honest critics for my comic, please",Reviews | Feedback,[],"I've been drawing my comic for almost one year with a snail pace and I need honest feedback / critics.
Here is the comic: Red Moon33
It's a political drama sets in East Asian-inspired world. A young astronomy nerd was kidnapped on his way to the National Exam and became involved in political intrigues.
Any CnCs are appreciated. Story, pace, art, writing, update schedule... or is this type of story suitable for bit-sized webcomic format, or should I redraw from a scratch (with simpler style), or should I nuke it down and make a new story altogether?
A little bit background (or rant).
I drew another sketch based comic titled String that is pretty well-received in Tapas and Webtoon (by my standard, which is not that high). So I'm encouraged to take comic more seriously and writing one of the main stories of my pet project. (String is actually a silly high school AU spin-off of my pet project). I cranked up the art with color, more details, etc. And the story with a full-blown political drama with subplots criss-crossing into a ""complex"" story which I love. And now I begin to regret it. The art takes a long time to draw I can only update every 6 weeks (which is not ideal). Got a reader told me (offline) that the time between updates are too long, she already forgot what happened in the previous episode. That combined with plot that requires attention to details by-design, makes a horrible combo. Well, who wants to remember all the details in a webcomic episode one's read 2 months ago? And re-read it just to understand the new episode? We have better things to do, right?

TLDR; I started a pretty ambitious project last year and begin to regret it. I'm not sure what to do or how to salvage this project (if it can), by making it better, more interesting, etc. 
That's why I need your help. Thanks a lot in advance.","['I think you did a really good there and congratulations on working one year on it.Unfortunately this is not a kind of story I´m interested in so I only browsed over the artworkand can´t judge the rest of it but the art looks really good', ""Honestly this is a neat comic, and I don't really get why it hasn't picked up more subs--have you been promoting it? Tapas won't do any promotion really, so like get this out there and in front of people. It's a nice comic. Give yourself a banner and give your account a user illo, that might also make it feel more robust. I don't think it's too hard to follow, although in the beginning I think it jumps around a bit and that got a little info-overload, but overall it's not too confusing.\nI do think that your episodes are too long. If it's taking 2 months, just chop it in half, or in thirds. You have natural breaks in all of these episodes that I read where you could have spliced it. People on webtoons who do these sprawling epics every week have assistants, they've got a ton of experience drawing really fast. You're one person, and you will get much faster as you go. So I would just...make each update shorter. Long enough to still make an interesting arc, but shorter for how much work you've made for yourself. especially since it's...fully painted.\nMy biggest complaint that turns me off as a reader is the compression issues in the earlier episodes (I didn't read all of it, but I read like...half? Kind of looking at the art and the plot as well) all of your nice painting is hidden behind severe compression. You got some impressive artifacting going on, almost as if it's been compressed multiple times.\nEither you are compressing it to be the smallest quality possible for these very, VERY long episodes (because I know the pain of having an episode too long for Tapas. It's pretty easy to hit that cap), or the program you are using isn't cutting the mustard. I'm not quite sure how it got that bad. Either way, I would find a better method and just recompile your first several episodes where this was pretty apparent, especially in the speech bubbles.\nIn that compression, there are places where the splicing is a little bit off between images. There's like this magenta line in Ep 5, for instance, that feels like it was more a compression error than something you wanted to be there. I feel like you saved your files much better later on (and also you had shorter updates, which might be part of the reason they were better quality files) and the compression isn't anything like in those first several updates.\nBut again, this is a nice comic. I can tell that your art is improving just so much in even the year you drew it, so if you keep it up I can see it being just so lovely in another year's time, but it's up to you since a year with only that many subs would be just very discouraging."", ""Hi, thanks a lot! I realize this kind of story is kinda niche. You're really nice for checking it though. Thanks."", ""Thanks a lot for the comment!\nThis comic takes so much time I don't really have anymore left for other drawing. But I'll start thinking about the banner, profile picture, and promotion. \nPreviously, I had a hunch that the comic was better binged than read once in 2 months due to its structure, thus my initial obsession with long episodes. I'll try shorter episodes for next updates. and experiment with episode length in the next updates. \nThe first 4 episodes are drawn in traditional page by page comic format, since I initially wanted to release it on Deviantart / Smackjeeves too. I realized too late that it's hard to fit traditional format into vertical scrolling webtoon, having to resize panels etc and make the quality dropped a lot. Hence, the only way to completely fix the issue is by redrawing the earlier episodes (1-4 or 1-5) but I'm still considering if it's worth the effort, since it will be better to reboot the comic that just fixed half of the episodes.\nThank you for your kind comment."", 'Your comic looks amazing!!! I can\'t wait to catch up - only have time for 2 eps this morning, but this is the kind of story I love. I can only assume/hope you have way more subs over on WT.\nI\'m not sure if this happened on both your WT and Tapas post, but here on Tapas you have a repeated panel and a cut off panel early on in your episode 1. That causes a bit of confusion and breaks flow during your first impression, so if I were you, I\'d double-check that on both platforms and resubmit the episode properly.\nAlso, you should really make a cover for Tapas to help more readers find your story. It doesn\'t even have to be a new piece of artwork if you\'re pressed for time - I bet you have a panel somewhere that would be better than the thumbnail you have if you crop strategically and add a title.\nYou can definitely post shorter episodes! I read a lot of Canvas and Tapas self-published as well as WT Originals and as a reader I absolutely expect and am fine with shorter episodes from the non-Originals. Anyone reasonable understands that a solo creator can\'t post 30-40 panels a week and might not always have that ""episode arc"" that makes perfect sense. So yup, more frequent/shorter posting would help both keep readers reminded of your story and put you in the fresh section more often. \nI flipped to the last ep just to see if it looks significantly different from the first couple and I think you could also get away with simplifying the art a bit if you want to.', ""I'll be blunt. The biggest issue I have with it is the synopsis. It doesn't say a lot about plot or characters. \n\n\nrattyrant:\nIt's a political drama sets in East Asian-inspired world. A young astronomy nerd was kidnapped on his way to the National Exam and became involved in political intrigues.\nThis was more interesting than the current synopsis.\nStories with long buildups or lengthy setups need to reveal more at the beginning so you can get a picture what the fuss is about. \nBesides that, I think you might benefit from a better first presentation. Thumbnail. Cover art etc. With the level you're currently at you can most definitely pull it off. \nConsidering your art concerns. Always listen to your readers when it comes to accessibility and readability especially the ones that take time to mention this.\nAs a side note as a desktop reader this is why I hate both Tapas and Webtoons with a passion."", ""Hi, thank you for your comment. Sorry for the late reply.I've fixed the cut off and repeated panels in Episode 1. \nI thought the series thumbnail is the same with cover but seems it's not. I'm going to make it after the reboot.\nI've decided to reboot the series after my next update (episode 11). I'll learn 3D and strengthen my art fundamental first though.\nThanks a lot."", 'Ok, I have checked only the first chapter and I feel I need to give a further read so I can give you a full review becuase it got me interested, so I think I should come at you later. meanwhile, just subscribed! ', ""Thanks for the comment. Synopsis is definitely my biggest weakness.\nI've fixed the failed panels per migxmeg comment, but I didn't get so many comments in the comic in this last year.\nI've decided to reboot the series and will create new cover and thumbnail for the series.\nThank you so much.\n**edit: sorry for my late reply, just got time to open the forum."", ""Thanks a lot.

200,What do you think as of right now?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'm very new to webcomics and digital art as medium and have been working since December 2020 and Jan 2021 on two different comics. 
One is updated daily and the other one I've been updating about once a month due to being inefficient and learning as I'm working on it. ( Also software and hardware changes have slowed me down considerably but it's still chugging along!) 
I would really love to know your general thoughts and first impressions on what both comics have to offer right now, nothing deep or analytical since there isn't much content to cover but I would really appreciate the feedback as there isn't much engagement on either comic right now on Tapas at least.

","[""It's okay to have comics that update monthly. We aren't machines and the expectation to post a lot a week is pretty bad but thats what social media has pushed most to expect.\nI love the simplicity and cuteness of Thought A Day, I think it helps other's feel less alone when dealing with similar issues and feelings.\nI still need to catch up on the other X3"", 'Thought A Day is cute, but I like it the most when it\'s a life lesson or a joke. if it\'s actually just a random thought, like episodes 1 or 2, I end up thinking ""wait, that\'s it?"".then again, maybe random thoughts are the point.also, what\'s up with ep 36? I can\'t see any image other than the promotional stuff.\nAs for Arbiter\'s wake - first of all, the concept is pretty cool. you handled exposition pretty well in chapter 1, but that section felt pretty dense with panels, and they were all pretty big. it got better after that, so i\'m guessing it was intentional? whatever effect you were trying to achieve with it didn\'t exactly work. also, would have been cooler imo if you didn\'t show us a dragon\'s face this early on, and instead showed a silhouette to build them up before they appear.I love the banter between the main character and that old guy. feels very natural and charming, good job on that! you might wanna work on your grammar a little, though. I don\'t think two periods at the end of a sentence ("".."") are a thing, and some sentences sound kinda off.also, Keyary is a bit of a weird name. next time, I think you should go with something that you can tell how to pronounce just by reading it.I like the artwork and the fire effects, but it\'s really hard to tell what\'s going on in the last few panels of episode 1. it\'s way too dark.speaking of which, holy shit. did not expect the story to turn dark as well. if you were going for shock value, you\'ve got it. feels pretty excessive, but I have no idea what kind of story you\'re trying to tell yet so we\'ll see.\nanyway, sorry if i was too detailed. good luck in your endeavors!', ""I second what @AwesomeSoFar has already said and would just add that I think in terms of improving the art for Arbiter's Wake, you could work on the line-work. Your lines are very even and thick, which I think is fine for a story that is less serious in tone, but the current line-work makes it feel a bit more cartoon-ish, so it makes those dramatic moments less impactful.  I'm not sure what digital art program you're using, but if you use Clip Studio Paint, it has a really cool feature for adjust the line thickness even after you're done drawing (as long as you do the lineart on a vector layer). If you aren't already, I would also suggest drawing at twice the size that actually gets uploaded so that when it's scaled down it kinda smooths everything out. Good luck!"", 'Thank you for the responses so far!\n@DelythThomasArt\nYou\'ve been very helpful with recommending CSP and with the tutorial videos for sure! It\'s made things a bit faster for me. Thanks for the feedback on ATADC, I\'m glad that \'s the impression you have, and can\'t wait to hear you catch up on Arbiter\'s Wake to get your thoughts.\n@AwesomeSoFar\nLove the honesty! I had to check ATADC episode 36 and oopsie doodle, looks like I misloaded it!  Thanks for pointing that out! I would have never caught it otherwise. As far as the content, it really just depends on my mood that day. Sometimes the comic is self-reflective, other times it\'s trying to motivate or inspire. A mixed bag for sure. \nAs far as your thoughts on Arbiter\'s Wake. I really love the feedback about showing the dragon\'s face too early in Episode 1. I hadn\'t considered that it would be more dramatic to obscure it, and thought that maybe if people saw an example of what dragons in this story looked like they\'d be interested in reading further. I\'m not quite sure what I was doing with the exposition either so we\'re both on that boat haha, I was just going for an introduction I suppose. \nThe comment on the grammar is something I\'m now aware of which is good, I have a bad habit of using ""..."" at the end of sentences so I\'ll be more aware of that in the future when doing the text. \nKeyary (Key-Are-EE) is a very odd name for sure and I can see your point on the pronunciation but honestly I can\'t pronounce the characters of most manga/comics I read so I don\'t think it personally bothers me if people mispronounce her name. I\'ve just been using it for over a decade at this point. \nThe end of the first episode was somewhat botched, it\'s something I tried to rectify in the start of episode two. I have no idea why the panels became so dark there at the end but yes its very hard to tell what\'s going on. I may just have to go back and rework those for clarity\'s sake. \nAs for the shock value. The story is a dark fantasy bordering on horror at times so violence, gore and disturbing content will definitely be a continued theme in future episodes.\n@drawnbyyannan\nThis is actually a major problem I\'m dealing with and definitely see what you mean about the the art appearing more cartoony. I think this is purely from lack of experience with CSP and knowing how to use the tools. I haven\'t used vector layers yet, but if you have a video regarding what you were talking about I\'d be very grateful! Currently I only use the default G-Pen to do all my linework. If there\'s a better way, please let me know!  \nIf anyone else has any feedback, please don\'t hesitate to respond!', 'Then pen is fine it may be more the size you use. Typically most draw with it set between 7-12px as its thickness. My comic i tend to use a 10px sized pen.\nOn the vector part, you create a layer with the vector layer button. Looks same but has a square in thw middle. This lets ur inking act like vectors so with the object tool you can adjust the shape, use the vector erase for quick tidy up (saves so much time!!!) And the correct line width tool which can thicken or thin the line you highlight.(TUTORIAL) WHY YOU SHOULD USE VECTORS IN CLIP STUDIO PAINT', 'You da real MVP.

201,"Hello Would love feedback and reviews on my comic, Dragon Tofu",Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi all! I started my comic last year, and have been releasing bi-weekly. The title is Dragon Tofu, and here is the synopsis: 
Toshiki and Kazu Fujiwara are brothers who live an ordinary life in an ordinary world working as insurance salesmen. While Toshiki is content with this salaryman life, Kazu strives to be part of a Guild: a registered group of individuals who hunt artifacts and capture criminals. After finishing up a quest, they begin to unravel the truth: that everything is not as normal as it once seemed.
I started drawing about last year, so I know I have a long way to go in terms of art itself. I have already written out most of the story in a large outline, and I feel it has a lot of stuff that would appeal to  a large but cult audience. I noticed that a lot of people are turned off by the weird heads of the main characters (which are tofu heads btw NOT minecraft or roblox LOL which is what i see on random pirate site comments a lot). I feel it is important to the story that they are tofu, but obviously I hope you follow this journey to see what it will entail. 
Hope you enjoy!

","[""After reading the first episode only, I can tell you...I like it. This is something I'll sub to.\n It's very niche though, and reminds me of series like Bobo-bo-bobobo, Keroro-Gunso, and Scissor Seven. I like zany comedy and silly premises so this is right up my alley.\nI think you may have difficulty gaining a mainstream audience, but if you stick with it, you could probably garner a cult audience for sure.

Yes, although it does have weird looking characters and humor similar to Bobo-bo-bobobo at times, I actually don't intend to write it like a gag manga / comic. I think when I first wrote the first chapter early last year, I was still finding my footing as to what kind of style i wanted to fit it into. and my humorous side tends to push me to make jokes when i can. I definitely don't want to veer towards making nonsensical jokes though and try to keep them more grounded / observational / something they would say in the moment and not just a nod to the audience.\nI completely agree that i don't think something like this would become mainstream.

Another thing I want to get out of the way first it that, I can tell that you want to instill mystery about the characters involved by not giving distinct descriptions or names at first and I\'m going to get into the issue I have about that later. And lastly, I\'m going to assume that English is not your first language, because it doesn\'t feel like it is, but correct me if I\'m wrong. \nI like the premise of the novel, it feels like it has a lot of potential for action and mystery and drama. But what it has in potential, it lacks in execution.\nProlouge\nOverall, the prologue was very stilted and awkward to read. There were multiple typos and the syntax (sentence structure) isn\'t well done. This prologue lacked suspense, action, and drama because at no point are we indicated to whom we, as readers, are supposed to side with, the soldier or the oni. The soldier also doesn\'t struggle against the oni. We never feel like that the soldier might fail, making the scene boring to read. And it\'s all over very quickly too. \nThe descriptions of the characters, and this continues in the other chapters, are kinda generic or nonexistent. Now I realize, some authors don\'t like describing their characters and that\'s fine, but for me personally as a reader, I prefer for some type of indication of what characters look like. The soldier is described generically as being ""covered in armor and cloth."" No indication of the color of the cloth, the patterns, the type of armor, what the armor is made of, if the armor is battle-torn, if the face of the soldier is obscured. Nothing.The main oni fought at the end of the chapter, is also described generically (and there\'s a typo). There\'s nothing to set this oni, of this story, apart from other generic, bargain bin devil/demon-like characters other than the hat and coat but then again, we aren\'t told what kind of hat or what kind of coat. This is set in Japan so I assume the hat and coat are Japanese in origin (maybe a rice paddy hat?) but for the uninitiated, the first thing thought of might be a top hat with a wide brim. If you are going to describe things and characters, do you due diligence when doing so. You don\'t have to get into long descriptions, but give more to the audience so they can understand and imagine things in their heads.\nChapter One\nThis chapter featured something that really drove home the idea that the execution of this novel is lacking: you telling the reader that Kagami is an outcast rather than showing the reader. Now I recognize that you wanted to keep the reason Kagami is an outcast a secret, but that doesn\'t mean you can show us through his interactions with other people. I suspect that was you goal with his interaction with his father, but rather than showing us the degree of separation between Kagami and others it just came off as you showing us the awkward father-son relationship between them. Or maybe that was your goal all along. \nOne thing that showing us Kagami being an outcast would\'ve done, is endear the reader to the character. There\'s not much going on with Kagami as of chapter one, and being isolated from other people is a common feeling many people have gone through. If you had shown how other don\'t interact with Kagami, that certainly would get more people invested in his story.\nKagami is also not described, at all I\'m pretty sure. Again you don\'t to stop the story to give a character description, you can weave it though out the narrative, only mentioning details where necessary.""Kagami\'s dark colored eyes twitched with annoyance after hearing the favor his father asked of him.""Speaking of, you don\'t really describe character action or reaction either.\nChapter Two\nThe thing that stuck out to me the most was the lack of continuity and the repetition in the dialogue and narrative. \nFirstly, the continuity: Kagami is laying down in the grass at the start of the chapter. You mention he looks out at the field, which is possible to do from laying down position, but then you say ""[He] sat back down against the grass..."" When did he get up? It\'s not too big of an issue, but not being able to keep track of the characters\' locations and positions are going to make future scenes, specifically action scenes, that much harder to follow.\nOnto the repetition: thrice you say ""He looked (or \'looking\') out into the field"" and twice Kagami starts a sentence with, ""I bet..."" Vary your sentences more and don\'t fall into the trap of repetition. Repeating phrases and words like that comes off as amateurish and are tedious to read. \nOne other thing, don\'t be afraid of establishing shots, or in this case, paragraph. Set the scene. if it\'s nighttime and there\'s a festival in the distance, the reader should be allowed to experience that. Imagine how enthralled the reader would be if the second chapter started like this: \n\n""High in the sky sat the crescent moon, it\'s cool, thin line of light glimmered on dark, grassy fields. The glow of the moon fought for attention with the fiery and bright blaze that was the festival\'s light. Decorations of every color hung from stalls offering food, games, and masks. The people bussed around, enjoying the night with their family and friends. They forgot about their day jobs and hardships as they listens to the high pitched, upbeat music and and danced to the rhythm. Everyone in town was basking in festival fun. Everyone but Kagami. Kagami, instead was company to himself and the crescent moon. Only he reveled in its glow, because he laid alone in the grassy fields watching the victimized sheep. He glanced beside him, observing the orange glow that burned into the darkened horizon and thought to himself \'I didn\'t even want to go to festival. It\'s not like I\'m needed there, anyway.\' He rolled over in the grass, facing his back to the festival, but then he heard something among the blades of grass.""\n\nSorry, I got a little carried away. I recommend writing more establishing scenes. They help portray the mood and emotions of scenes while also giving the reader a chance to be transported into the world you\'re writing about. Now not every scene needs an establishing paragraph, but not having any at all can leave the reader feeling uninvested and confused. We don\'t even realize it\'s night until the third paragraph of this chapter! I assumed it was evening time, not night.\nAgain typos, At some you have a sentence that says, ""The French were thrown back into the hill with great force, barely missing Kagami."" I had to pause for a minute because I was thinking \'the French? I thought we were in Japan? Oh it\'s a typo, they mean the fence\'. You might want to add another round of proofreading before posting so you catch mistakes like that that pull the reader out of the story.\nFinal Thoughts\nSo I think overall, the issues that I see are the typos, awkward and tilted sentences, a lack of varied diction, a lack of establishing paragraphs, little to no descriptions, and the chapter lengths.\nTypos: Try and get someone who\'s a native english speaker to read over your drafts, pass the drafts through proofreading site like Grammarly, or read your drafts out loud. These are all way to catch small mistakes that go a long way in making your novel feel more polished.\nAwkward and tilted sentences:This is something reading your words aloud might fix.\nA lack of varied diction: There\'s a lot of repetition of words and phrases. If you ever find yourself repeating words, consider opening a thesaurus. Try to only use repetition sparingly and where it can make a point in the narrative. \nA lack of establishing paragraphs and little to no descriptionsThese are kind of the same thing. There\'s not enough describing going on, not of the setting or the characters. And when you do describe things, the descriptions come of as dry and generic. For example, how you describe the oni as having ""blood, red skin."" Trying to find different ways and words to express comparison in your descriptions. Instead of ""blood, red skin"" what about ""skin dipped in blood"" or ""skin as crimson as a fire,"" just something different. Chapter lengthsThis is something small I\'m bringing up at the end, but your chapters are very short. And their brevity feels less purposeful and more like you don\'t know what else to say. You\'re not establishing your scenes, you\'re not describing your characters, you\'re not getting into the action, you\'re not getting into the emotion of the scene or characters. Things come off as flat and boring, when there\'s much more beneath the surface. It feels like I\'m reading a rough draft, a first draft, rather than a final draft.\n I\'m sorry if this seems like a lot or if any of this comes of as harsh, I don\'t mean it that way. There\'s plenty of potential for the story to be great, but it\'s going to take a lot of hard work to get there. I commend you for not only putting your story out there, but also asking for critique on it. I hope this helps you when writing future chapters and good luck!

204,A feedback and review would be helpful,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So, I just posted the first episode of my new series. I want to take my time for each episodes. So, having a review of the first episode will give me some idea on how to and how not to describe the story in future, and if everything is okay. Should I follow this style and carry on? Or, should I modify some part of the writing style?  Anything that requires more work? Thanks!

","['Im not the most appropiate person to give a review since English is not my native language and Im too far from becoming a writer not even for tos ave my life (I admire writers for that) What I felt is that the first paragraph was too short. Ive read books beggining the same way and its a good way to start a story but as I said I felt it too short. I needed to know something else either from olaf or the enviroment or what he was doing in that momment. The second paragraph just need some more mysteryous description??? idk like it was too blunt too like a dictionary description. I think it can be fixed and you still say all what these monsters are in that second paragraph too.The other thing I noticed is many sencences beging with ""Olaf"". Maybe you could play a bit with that??\nI am sorry if Im not able to help much', 'Thank you. Will keep those in mind. Appreciate the review.', ""What's the age group this is intended for?\nI like the part at the end in italics. I feel like you are going for a bit of a prologue with this? You've described what they are doing before they are sucked into this portal.  Got that. Some of your descriptions are vivid, and some you've left a little bland. \nI might describe the palisade- dimensions maybe? Just a suggestion. love the bit about the duster. It flowed really well."", 'Actually, I should have mentioned everything that happened in it is within the dimension. I am not describing what happened before they got sucked into the dimension. Thank you. Now I understand the vague part. I will make it clear by saying at the beginning of the italic paragraph at the end that ""It took one year for them to build this sanctuary after they spawned in this dimension. The unfortunate event happen one year ago: "".  Maybe that will clear things up?\nAnd, thanks a lot for the feedback. It was actually more bland when I first posted it, but after seeing the first review in this thread, I modified it a lot and added more visuals and interactions. Especially the one part that you liked about the duster is part of the new addition.\nSo, I\'d love to know the parts you found bland so that I can try working on them and learn the pattern of what makes something bland to readers and what not.\nUmm. Not sure about the targeted audience since I have seen teens who are 13/14 enjoy series like Game of Thrones and Attack On Titan, and adults who enjoy cartoon shows for kids. But, generally speaking, I\'d say young adults, probably.  This is like Game of Thrones in the post-apocalyptic world. This is Fallout in a different Setting. But, it won\'t contain any mature love scenes.\nYes, It\'s a type of introductory episode, but not entirely a prologue. I mean not the traditional type prologues. But, I suppose you can say it’s a prologue by definition.\nYes, I will go in-depth about the dimension and gradually  work on the world building over the course of the story flow.', 'It\'s in present tense- which I don\'t write a lot of- so, bear with me here. Your first sentence is the intro to the rest of the story. It can make or break a novel right out of the gate. You want something with a punch that sets the tone for the rest of the chapter.\nI might, totally a suggestion, say:\nMealots were a vicious lot. \n(And then describe them.) something the MC hates most about them works well, like  how much they smell when their heads are removed or something.\nRemember to keep to present tense if you are sticking with it. In the second paragraph, exuded should be exude.\n""Why is it every time we build a barricade there is a counterattack?"" Olaf asks, glancing at Hank. (I do love this line of dialogue. I can hear the exasperation.) Now, the tricky part here, is that you\'ve described the sweat and then repeat that Hank is sweating. All I know about Hank at this moment is that he sweats. Who is he?\nThen suddenly we have Omer- and we\'ve headhopped- unless you are going for 3rd person omnisicient- I\'d suggest Olaf being envious of Omer\'s duster(because I am, lol) and you can still keep the line about where the duster came from. This tells me a little about Omer.\nWhy does Hank stop sweating? Have the man take a deep breath maybe? This adds description- and possibly have him doing something to show he\'s a mechanic? What is he working on?\nIntroduce the men much slower, and with an action, so the reader can ground themselves in the characters. I want to know them. Showing- is giving me an action, like you did with Omer- he\'s making a potion- that tells me so much about him, along with the bit about the coat. I know more about him than I do about the others, until we get to the italics- and then you\'re telling the reader who is who and who does what.\nSo far, Omer is the only character I know anything about, as if you are more comfortable in his head than the others?\nDoes this help? ', ""Yes..Thank you!  This helps a lot. \nTbh, I am trying to write in omniscient perspective, but I didn’t know the difference between head hopping and omniscient. I just googled it. \nI need to do a bit of a study on it more. xD\nAnd, I really prefer to write in present tense because I am used to playing DnD a lot. So, the style sticked with me. \nI see. Will do. I'll modify the starting line. And the suggestions sound splendid to me. I'll incorporate them and update. \nAh, I see now. Adding what Hank is doing is a great way of showing!  It's  so simple yet I didn’t think of that. Thanks. Will keep the pattern in mind. \nThat was a really informative feedback. Truly appreciate it. Learned a lot. I'd love to read your novel, but I am an aromantic asexual. So, unfortunately, romance is not my cup of tea. Thanks a lot again. I'll update it tonight after I am done working on it.""]",2/22/2021 21:35,https://forums.tapas.io/t/a-feedback-and-review-would-be-helpful/55413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The colours are definitely the highlight here, especially the sea, which really evokes that feeling of being at the beach.for things to look out for, the perspective is a little confusing on that rocky outcrop and the horison line. Also that cloud that\'s below the horison, overlapping the water would need to be extremely low. Maybe look up some reference pics for getting an eye for this kind of thing. ""Perspective! For Comic Artists"" by David Chelsea is a good book on the subject.\nOverall ,this is a good start with a strong atmosphere and personal style though, keep at it!', 'It’s definitely confusing just as you said lmao i was just kinda guesstimating where everything should be and need to learn more about perspective.

', ""\nbg.jpg2000x1971 664 KB\n\nI think it looks pretty good, just needs a little adjustment in my opinion.\n\nI would straighten out the horizon line and maybe follow the perspective a little tighter with the waves. \nFor the waves, I would stay away from brown and use those lovely colors you already had in there. I looked up some reference for how waves crash on a beach to get a feel for the shapes of the waves. You could also add some nice foam washing up on the beach.\nI also moved the island in the back up a little bit and straightened out that perspective line. I made the water in the distance quite a bit darker, and got rid of a lot of the water detail, because at that distance you're not going to be able to see much as far as individual waves.\n\nHope there's something here you find useful!

Right now it’s a bit wavy, but in reality the horizon line is so far away that it will look completely flat, even if the water has waves (hope you get what I mean). \nFor the clouds I think it helps if you make them follow the perspective of the sky, so for example the clouds that are closer to the horizon line will be smaller, and clouds “higher up” in your pix will be larger.

210,Looking for feedback on my fantasy story[NOVEL] Feedback in exchange,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello there!
Although I am a recent addition to Tapas, I have worked on my epic fantasy book for close to 8 years now. During that time I have done perhaps 3-4 major rewrites and countless smaller fixes. But I would still like some fresh feedback on my story. 
And one thing I haven't gotten around to improving is my blurb - there have been comments that it's kind of long, but it's sort of OK because I am writing epic fantasy and short blurbs are impossible to achieve in that genre.
If you'd be interested in checking out my story, in exchange, I can check out yours. I am confident that I have enough experience of my own that I am able to give constructive criticism.

Beyond the Void | Tapas
A dreary age has lasted far too long, and torpor has seeped deep into the hearts across the continent of Tavran. All races pray for change and golden ages of the past, but they have no strength to bring it about. Neither does anyone have the strength...





","['I think the shorter blurb notion comes from how it would cut short in the preview link you share around.\nSuggestion is you condense your blurb to its catchiest part (just some sentences or a paragraph) so it is short enough to be shown in your preview link, then add separator and show your longer full blurb below (which will not be shown in link preview). The shorter blurb draws attention in shared link, and the long one below will give people a clear image when they decided to click. I have seen premium series has two kind of blurbs like this.\nI think it is the culture of Tapas, but writers here tend to shorten their blurbs.\n\nThat aside, I do really think your blurb can be condensed and made more interesting. It is a nicely worded and thorough blurb, you also mentioned your inspiration which makes familiar readers have easy time to relate. However, I do not know if I am just stupid (sorry ESL, I no spik Inglish) or I cannot get a clear view of what it is about by paragraph two, while paragraph three is not helping. I just get that land goes brr, almighty prince appear, scoundrel, hello I am king, refugee, struggle of power, then things goes kinda okay, but. . . Oh no! Things are more complex than it is appear! Hee hee read to find out. \nIt is to me more like an explanation of world history or events prior to the actual story people would post in their prologue, not what the actual story is going to be about (sorry if it is, but that would be a synopsis, right?). Maybe you can shorten the world history into relevant bits (like ""Struggle of power by prince, scoundrel, king, and refugee to save the land ended up pretty okay, or is it?"") and save it for the actual story\nAnother is, how about you expand the urgency and focus on what happened afterwards? What would happen and why should we care if there is a more complex event at play? How will it take place? Will the prince get a new unicorn? Will the land be ravaged by orcs? Will a pink-haired princess transferred from another world called Korea marry the scoundrel?\nI think the purpose of blurb are to give insight, entice, and make reader care about the story. If reader is at loss and cannot form an expectation, I do think the blurb is better be improved.\n\nThis is just my opinion, and I am no expert myself. Sorry if I make a mistake or offend you.\nAlso I don\'t meant this for feedback exchange. I am not offering one, just commenting on your words regarding the blurb', ""\n\naarujarv:\nAnd one thing I haven't gotten around to improving is my blurb - there have been comments that it's kind of long, but it's sort of OK because I am writing epic fantasy and short blurbs are impossible to achieve in that genre.\nWhat you can do is to put the log line first, then the rest of your bulb. No matter how epic your book is, it still has the core, the main selling point that can be summarized in one or two sentences. \nYeah,  it's not an easy task, but you know your book inside out, you know what's so great about it and why you wanted to write it in the first place, so distill it  in  the log line and put it out there  for everyone to see and WANT to  read it."", 'Hello! Just building off of what other have already mentioned since I also got lost in the blurb:\n• The focus of your blurb should mirror the focus of your story. If the plot is more protagonist vs world/society, then lean into more of the core world lore that is going to be the focus of the problem. • If the plot is more characters vs characters then lean into the tension between them.• Since the blurb is sort of out of context from the rest of the novel (for the reader it should be more of a hook than a summary), don’t focus on world building in it. I personally dont like reading a bunch of dense world building in general, and if its the first thing I see about a novel I tend to not read further.• Keep it focused. The blurb should give the reader a basic/rough idea of what the plot/main struggle is about. After reading your blurb all I really know is that this society is essentially bored/stagnant.', ""I just wanted to show the difference between the Garrdenss of  the Moon blurb  and yours (since it's your comp):\nGardens of the Moon\nThe Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations. Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.\nFor Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.\nHowever, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand . . .\n\nWhile this blurb is long-winded, and is overloaded with the unnecessary names, it manages to create some sense of  urgency. The book  would not have been read on-line based on that blurb though, imho. On-line is cutthroat.\nBut if we, perhaps, can inject some energy into yours, by deleting the fiiller, it could get closer, while sticking to the  style.\nSuggested  example:\nA dreary age has lasted far too long.\nThe prince of the Eternal Empire of Tavran is desperate to reclaim the legacy of his predecessors. He wants his vain fight to rekindle the hearts and make his subjects believe that he holds the key to the New Golden Age. But if he is to usher the new era, he must first let go of  his pride and confront the sinister threat rising in the Imperial Capital."", 'I read up until chapter 4. Your writing is solid except for normal minor spelling/grammar flubs. I only ended up with a couple of notes.\n\nNo prologue! Jumping right in. Fantastic. Your blurb had me worried that there would be a hefty one.\nThe word retarded feels out of place for the setting. Almost any synonym would fit better in my opinion.\nIm not sure if the city they are walking through is supposed to be busy or not.\nUse a dash (-) when speech is cut off, not an ellipses (...). Ellipses typically mean there is a delay or long pause.\nThe intro (ch1) is solid. The main interest is finding out about what exactly “the flow” is as a magic system as well as how this heist will go.\nI like the first two characters that we are introduced to. I really like that their flaws are present right away, it makes them more appealing and relatable.\nI like the chapter lengths. They might be a bit long for casual readers, but if you’re going for novel format they’re fine.\nYou could probably break some of your scenery descriptions down into smaller sentences (the cliff description). The overall content of the descriptions is good though!\n\nWere you looking for feedback on anything specific?']",2/18/2021 4:46,https://forums.tapas.io/t/looking-for-feedback-on-my-fantasy-story-novel-feedback-in-exchange/55194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","['I read the first post so this isn\'t very thorough.\nVery nicely written and doesn\'t stumble. There are obvious punctuation errors, but those don\'t bother me if the story reads well, which this does. There\'s a good amount of description without being unnecessarily overwhelming (which I see a lot of on Tapas) and I was able to keep up and understand everything that was happening. Only issues I have are my own personal gripes, like repeating words in the same sentence or even the next. Such examples are saying ""her father"" twice in a row, where I believe it would read better if you simply change the section mention to ""him"" or his name. But that\'s just a suggestion from my own opinion.\nVery strong start. I\'ll subscribe so I can read it some more. The first episode draws interest.

","[""Whats up B.A.L,\nOkay first I think you got to take a step back and realize what you have and probably get into the mindset that comic and growing an audience takes time. I was a follower of your last work MAO REBORN before you dropped the project and remember you asking a similar question revolving it. I seen this series was a new one of yours but didn't want to engage too in depth with it due to the last series ending abruptly which I was actually really enjoying.\nFor this project I really do think that you have to enjoy the process of just slowly growing your following, you only started doing this and publishing it via webtoons since October 2020, that isn't that long ago, so I hope you aren't expecting one piece level of following for a fairly new comic. You do have a solid following and the art seems solid, but the fact of the matter is building an audience as a new creator for anything is difficult and a long game.\nIf you can't enjoy that game and are always doubting it can really hinder your love for why you even wanted to start making comics in the first place.\nMake the story you love, put it out there and continue to build; also try and engage in these forums and it doesn't even have to be just on a promotional basis, there are really cool people here that love to create just like you and feel actually talking with the community here can help also which could possibly lead to more eyes on your project."", 'Only had time to read the first two episodes for now, but I\'ll give some feedback based on that.\nSo far, it seems pretty good! Tournament style series are my jam, the introduction gives good context but is short and to the point, and I think even as early as the first episode including a showcase fight to give new readers a taste of what\'s to come was a good choice! The art is also generally pretty good. The characters and backgrounds are both well-drawn. The only comments that I have are nit-picky things, or personal preferences so take them as you will.\n\nFirst of all, you might consider removing the first ""episode"" that is just the cover page. I don\'t think too many people would actually be put off by that alone, but it takes up unnecessary space in the episode count, especially since you include the cover page at the start of each episode anyways. \n\nNext this is a personal thing, but some folks might agree- I\'m not a huge fan of screen tone texture in webcomics tbh. They have a definite place in print comics as they\'re a way to keep printing costs down by allowing a book to be printed in pure black & white rather than gray scale. In web formats, however, they can sometimes muddy up a drawing and make everything a little harder to look at. Especially in cases where the dots are rather large like this:\n\nIt adds a lot of texture to an otherwise un-textured surface that I don\'t find particularly appealing. In stark contrast, some of these panels that are done in pure black and white are super crisp and look very clean. Particularly panels featuring the samurai guy in the first fight:\n\nScreen Shot 2021-02-16 at 12.51.01 PM.png393x670 50.1 KB\n\nBeautiful. It\'s a stylistic choice so don\'t feel compelled to change it just because of me, but I think that full fill grayscale would read better in areas where it\'s needed.\n\nMy last comment is just that the design of the main girl here will likely be rather polarizing lol. With a design like a virgin killer sweatshirt variant, a short skirt that allows for a panty shot upon her first introduction, and... I\'m not even sure what cup size breasts, you\'re losing out on universal appeal right from the get go. Some people will definitely be there specifically for that, but similarly a large portion of potential audience may be repelled by it as well  \nFor example I don\'t mind a bit of fan service in works that I read but I had an immediate ""oh jeez"" reaction when she was introduced sleeping in the ship, in a pin-up style pose to boot lol. To throw an alternative example out, I think the cowgirl from the first fight has a really cute and sexy design as well, but if she were the main character even it might not elicit such a strong reaction because it\'s toned back a little bit. Again, though, just my opinion and food for thought- I don\'t expect you to go redesigning your main character or anything xD\n\nBest of luck moving forward ', ""Hi there! I actually remember randomly coming across your series as I was looking at making my own comic. I too just started posting my webtoon so I'm always looking for ways to boost it. \nSomething to remember is a lot of webtoon canvas stories that are hits get randomly picked by staff or end up in like the 'top 30' then blow up. You might get lucky, you might not, but I think one thing is consistency in the quality of art and a release schedule.\nDirectly speaking about your comic:\n\nI think the art is fine. Everyone can always improve but I don't think it would deter anyone, especially since I've seen a lot lower quality art that is popular on webtoon. If the story is good, you're usually okay\nI will say the cover art does seem higher quality than the rest of the comic - but that is not uncommon for the title pages to be a lot more detailed. I know webtoon is big on colored comics so someone seeing a title page in color then realizing it is in black and white could be off-putting or discouraging them from reading.\nOne thing about the look of the comic, and I'm not sure exactly what the reasoning is, would be the speech bubbles. It seems like the words are really crammed into the bubbles or off-centered. I doubt this would be a huge issue for people but just something I noticed.\nI think you have a good story and some nice elements. It does feel a bit rushed/imbalanced in pacing. It's tricky with comics because you have to keep a balance of required info and action. No one cares in an anime if there are 3-5 minutes of conversation but that can seem really long to get across in a comic format. I also felt that the action was sometimes hard to follow. All easily fixed, just something I personally felt when reading, others could disagree. \n\nThese are all opinions of course. I think you have a good premise/idea for your comic. I think things like adding color, working on pacing/establishing the environment, could help draw readers in more."", 'Ok, I see what you\'re saying. I should probably mention that while I do the character designs, a lot of the art is done by my assistant and I allow him free reign. Your point about the dots is well noted, we actually discussed that and I\'ve been wondering if it can be a bit displeasing to the eye when I read through the chapters. That is something we may end up changing and I\'m glad you brought it up, it gives us a lot to think about.\nNow onto the character design of Sera, while the outfit I am cool with I will admit she can be a bit....much. Her original design had smaller breasts but my assistant/editor thought ""enhancing"" her would get more eyes on the series if anything else, so I went with his suggestion. I might scale it back a bit, especially with the breasts because even I had to cringe a bit when re-reading the series. Here i\'ll give you a pic of what she originally looked like\n\nSera.jpg1410x2483 166 KB\n\nSo yeah, I may just go back to that. At any rate, I do appreciate your feedback you have helped me a lot.', 'Thanks for the feedback! I agree about the cover being more detailed, it\'s mainly because we worked on the cover a lot longer than we do the pages. It\'s why I\'ve considered adding another member to my team so the art can be more improved. \nAbout the speech bubbles, I tend to get ""wordy"" with my dialogue so maybe I should work on saying the same thing in less words. \nWe were also thinking about adding color, which I think would fix some of the issues with following the action. \nOnce again, thanks for the feedback, you are a huge help.', 'No problem! If you haven\'t already done so, writing a script for your comic can help you figure out how long the dialogue usually is ahead of time.\nI typically write out my story and in a long list of bullet points of what I want to happen in arc or chapter. Then I go through and break up the points into one issue/update. This lets me know exactly what I want to happen from start to finish in a comic issue.\nAfter that, I write my script and try to make sure that everything flows well and it allows me to see if I\'m doing to much. A lot of time showing is better than telling. For example:\nInstead of saying ""I\'m shocked! What do you mean you\'ve known this whole time?! You\'re unbelievable!""You can just have the character with a shocked expression say ""Are you serious? Unbelievable!""\nSame message but fewer words and more images.', ""Yeah I do like this design more haha,\nI love writing for female characters as well as designing for them (my main character is female), so I do try to portray them in away that actually fits their character; female characters can have large breasts but of course like all physical features it shouldn't define them so if that's not the case with your character you should be fine but if it is and it becomes a highlight of her, I would rethink and redesign it for sure if you want that character to be more than a pair of breasts\nAs a writer you should stick with your gut for your story as well as your characters,  it's great you take your editors advice for sure but sometimes it can vary. Enhancing a character's bust size is a very simplistic and rather weird way of bringing attention for your series unless of course your making something ecchii related which isn't the case for your story.""]",2/16/2021 15:06,https://forums.tapas.io/t/whats-holding-my-series-back/55139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary

A light flashed. Jamie looked up at the screen.
“Okay, Jamie,” said Joshua Ford. “Try gripping the egg again with your left hand. I’ve tweaked some settings on my end.”
Jamie read the subtitles on the screen. “Okay.” The diodes on her arm turned blue as she reached from the egg. “Almost…” Jamie lightly gripped the egg and CRACK! The egg shattered in her hand. 
Jamie took a shuddered breath as she tried to keep herself from crying. She’d broken two dozen eggs during their testing that day and three dozen the day before that.
“This shouldn’t be so hard,” she whimpered, sitting back on her stool. Her body didn’t feel like her own anymore. If she had been able to relearn how to walk on the T.I.M.E. prosthetic leg after the explosion, she should be able to regain the use of her hands. The two cybernetic implants in her arms restored feeling, but they also gave her enhanced strength. She felt like a giant trying to launder tissue paper.
“It’s okay, Jamie,” comforted Joshua. “You’ve gone through a traumatic experience. You are the first human to receive these types of enhancements. There’s going to be a learning curve.”
Jamie laughed dryly. “Yeah, a learning curve.” She pointed to her ears. The explosion had left her partially deaf in her right ear and completely deaf in her left ear. She was scheduled later that day for a procedure to active and fine-tune her bionic ear. Joshua had promised it would completely restore and improve her hearing. “What about my ears? I feel like a lab rat.”
“You just have to have a little faith…”
Another light flashed, alerting Jamie that someone was outside of her lab. “I got to go, Joshua. Someone is at the door.”
“Alrighty,” he replied. “Call me later, and we can keep testing the enhancements.”
“Okay, bye Joshua.” Jamie peeled off the diode stickers as she shuffled to the door of her workshop. 
“Hi Daddy.”
“Hi sweet girl,” he signed. “How are you doing?”
“Fine,” she signed back. “We’ve been testing my grip strength again today.”
Cole looked at the faint, fingerprint indentions on the doorknob. “How’s that coming?”
“It shouldn’t be this hard,” she voiced. “I’m usually can learn things just like that,” Jamie snapped her fingers. “But, for some reason I can’t learn how to grab things.”
“It’s just takes practice,” he reminded her. “It took you time when you were a baby to learn your own strength; it’s going to take you time to learn your strength again now.”
Jamie smiled and signed, “why are you so smart?”
“Because I’m your pa. It’s part of my job.” 

","['Here are some things that jump out at me:\n\n""reached from the egg"" seems like it should be ""reach for the egg"" as it seems the egg in question is something she\'s grabbing and not coming out of.\n""She pointed to her ears"" comes immediately after she says ""Yeah a learning curve"" which makes it sound like her ears are relevant to said learning curve. I personally would move ""she pointed to her ears"" to a new paragraph and continue or re-word the end of that paragraph to have ""what about my ears"" come before the sentence ""she pointed to her ears. This then gives a better opening to the next sentences explaining her deafness. You could also leave ""I feel like a lab rat"" at the end or possibly have it as a new thought altogether because the two sentences she says , while technically related to each other, are two separate thoughts.EX: “What about my ears?"" She pointed to her ears. The explosion had left her partially deaf in her right ear and completely deaf in her left ear. She was scheduled later that day for a procedure to active and fine-tune her bionic ear. Joshua had promised it would completely restore and improve her hearing. She sighed, “I feel like a lab rat.”\n""I’m usually can learn things just like that"" where ""I\'m"" should be ""I""\n“It’s just takes practice,” should be ""It""\n\nOther than these few things, I think it\'s well written  I would also say, as a chapter, it seems a bit short.', 'Thanks! There is another part to this chapter, it was just kinda long. I can post that part too. That bit about being a lab rat is helpful!!!', 'Awesome! Glad to help ', 'Part 2\nSummary\n\nJamie’s stomach was in knots by the time they’d reached the clinic. She gripped Cole’s arm as the medical staff escorted them into the procedure room. Cole gave her a worried glance. “You okay?”\n“Nervous? I guess.” she signed. “I don’t know what’s going on… They are all talking too fast.”\nCole looked at her ear. “Where’s your hearing aid?”\n“In my pocket.”\n“Put it in.”\nThe medical assistant stopped in front of a gray, metal door. “Mr. Carter, you can wait in the next room.” Cole gave Jamie’s hand a squeeze and went into the next room. Jamie nodded and slipped on her hearing aid. “Right this way, Miss Carter. Dr. Faust will just be a few minutes.”\nThe room was dark and covered with dark gray, soundproof paneling.  There was a single chair in the room. It reminded her of a dental chair in the infirmary, except for the thick, leather bindings at the wrists and ankles and a halo-like brace around the head. Jamie gulped as she sat down in the hard chair.\nA few minutes later, two assistants came into the room wearing peppy, pink scrubs. The bright color didn’t help squelch the gnawing feeling in her stomach. One assistant looked down at Jamie and smiled. “You have nothing to be worried about,” she said. “The procedure is perfectly safe.”\nJamie nodded as they tightened the restraints. A gray-haired man in a white lab coat came into the room. He talked faster than Jamie could understand and plopped a heavy pair of headphones over her ears. A string of lights around the halo lit up and began to swirl.\nThe screen on the opposite wall began to count down. The halo of lights turned red. Pressure pounded her head. Tears welled up in her eyes. “Stop,” she sobbed. “P-please… Please!” The halo lights turned blue. She fainted.\n\n“Let me in there!” Cole roared, as the two security guards tried to hold him back. He could hear Jamie’s sobs as the machine worked. “She’s hurt.”\t\n“Relax, Mr. Carter,” ordered the doctor. “Let the machine do its job. The patient is fine.”\nThe machine stopped. Jamie blinked her eyes. Did it work? The chair lifted her into a seated position. Through the tiny window, she could see Cole struggle against the guards.\n“Please, I need to be there. If anything—”\nJamie cocked her head to the side and listened. In spite of the closed door and thick, concrete walls, she could hear them. She could hear every word.\n“Daddy?”\nCole looked up and saw her through the window. “Jamie?” Relief covered his face. “Sweet girl, can you hear me?” \nJamie nodded. “Every word.”\nThe door to the procedure room flew open. Cole stormed the room. “Jamie!”With a twist of her wrist, Jamie broke the bindings. Cole pulled her into his embrace. Jamie pressed her ear against his chest. She could hear the rhythmic thump of Cole’s heart. “I can hear…”\n“You can hear…”\n\n', 'A couple of things that are my own personal peccadillos  so I tend to see them... everywhere... lol\n\n\n\ncherrystark:\n“You just have to have a little faith…”\n""just""  man, I so overuse that word and someone once pointed out to me that they could tell the difference between a male and female writer by how often the word was used because women use it like they use the words ""I\'m sorry"" all the time.  Weird.  So small and insignificant.\n\n\n\ncherrystark:\nAnother light flashed, alerting Jamie that someone was outside of her lab. “I got to go, Joshua. Someone is at the door.”“Alrighty,” he replied. “Call me later, and we can keep testing the enhancements.”“Okay, bye Joshua.” Jamie peeled off the diode stickers as she shuffled to the door of her workshop.\nI have this ""thing"" about constantly using someone\'s name when people talk to each other. It\'s the audio dramatist in me. Old Time radio used it a lot because people couldn\'t see who was talking... but they didn\'t need to if actors had different voices or were male or female. Anyway... again, it\'s just me. But she says she has to go and uses his name, then says bye to him using his name again.  this is why I don\'t edit.\n@orbitkatart had a point with ""from"" the egg unless she was reaching from it to another place but it doesn\'t read that way. \nI had no problem with the ear motion because, you know me, I immediately picture things so I could see her pointing to her ear and giving him one of those ""ya think?"" motions... but that\'s me.\n\n\ncherrystark:\n“I’m usually can learn things just like that,”\ntypo I\'m assuming ""I\'m"" usually can learn etc.\n\n\ncherrystark:\n“It’s just takes practice,”\nAlso typo ""It\'s"" just takes practice \nI\'m being nitpicky\n\n\ncherrystark:\nsitting back on her stool.\nNot so sure about sitting back on a stool. Last time I did that I fell off... Although... I was in a bar  with a 7-sample flight of craft beers....\nAside from my nitpicking... looks fairly good. There might be some questions but those are basically because this is only a portion of something else so I\'m only looking at what\'s in front of me.', ""Thanks!  I admit some of those are typos, easy fixes.\nThis story's posing a challenge because I have to find the right balance of history and drive for more character growth. I'm excited to see where this story takes me."", ""I think the fact I only found nitpicky things that have nothing to do with the story means you're on the right track."", ""@cherrystark - The first section is well-written, and the points I would have made have been addressed above. One thing I noticed is that Pa and Jamie are signing to each other. If that's unusual in the context of this story, have you considered using <> or italics? It would help differentiate the communication between these characters (or this method of communication) from everyone else.\nSection two - again, well written all in all. I might suggest being more descriptive during the scene with the hearing procedure. Pressure pounding, tears welling in her eyes - good sensory details, but those could also describe a bad headache. I think it would be more powerful for the reader if there's a touch more detail about her feeling like her head's about to explode, and it would set up Pa's going-to-tear-down-the-door reaction quite nicely as well. "", ""Thanks for the feedback. The signing is a new addition to Jamie's character. She lost her hearing in the last story, so she and her dad learned how to do sign. Signing in stories is still new for me. I read that you should punctuate/format it like voiced speech. I'm still learning the details on how to do it properly"", 'Here is another excerpt I could use thoughts on.\n\nStacks of antique manuscripts covered the library table, silently begging for Jamie to translate them. Jamie rubbed her knee, a nervous habit she had picked up after her surgery. She stared at the table, bored. Jamie ached to resume her normal maintenance work but she wasn’t cleared to work for another six weeks. \nHer mind drifted to the others. The museum was too quiet with everyone gone. Felix meowed loudly, demanding attention as he jumped on to the table in front of her.\n“Hi Fe. How is my pretty kitty?” The sleek black cat purred happily as Jamie scratched him behind the ears. “Everybody’s gone,” she whispered. Tears threatened. “Serena, Nick, Robin, Dad…” She felt a twinge of guilt as she remembered the bus driving away the day before. “I didn’t even say goodbye to my dad when he left…”\nFelix meowed loudly and scampered off. “Felix?” she called. “Where are you going?” A pink, holographic bubble appeared over her leather cuff. “What the…”\nJamie ran down corridor to the computer room. If the computer had located a new artifact, an agent would need to retrieve the artifact as quickly as possible. Alex had disappeared after the incident in New Orleans. Despite Kendra’s relentless tracking, he hadn’t been found. Jamie always worried about the mysterious “them” Alex referred to getting their hands on the artifact.\nJamie punched in a command into the computer. A world map appeared on the screen. The  location of every active museum agent appeared on the screen. Cole and Nick’s markers were heading south to Mexico City where they were going to meet Kendra. \nThe computer began to search for agents within a one-hundred-mile radius. A red X indicated that there were no agents in the immediate area. The nearest agents were working on a dig in northern Quebec in coordination with several First Nation groups. \nHer mind went to Johnathan and the mystery assignment that had taken him away from her. She typed in his name into the search field.  Jamie gulped. There were only three ways for an agent’s tracker to be deactivated from the map: retirement, defection, and… death. \nThe thought of Johnathan dead made Jamie feel sick to her stomach. She looked down at the cat, swirling around her ankles. “I guess, it’s up to me Felix…”\n']",2/14/2021 20:54,https://forums.tapas.io/t/i-need-feedback/55034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Follow this spoilt rich guy as he wanders around hoping maybe his story might have a plot!"" isn\'t going to give me a lot of faith in the writer\'s ability to capture my attention with an exciting story that I can\'t put down.I\'ve only read bits of your comic, but from what I remember, the main selling point is that it\'s about a guy who fights. A LOT. Like he goes through all these massive battles where he singlehandedly takes on tons of badass supernatural monsters and similar in combat. So that should be in there. Maybe something like:\nBorn into a rich family, Luca Vincenzo has always had everything he ever wanted, but when he sets out on a journey to find some meaning in life, he never could have expected to be dragged into a series of increasingly deadly brawls against powerful supernatural entities, and perhaps a fight for the fate of the world.

","['Since no one gave you a review, I’ll try my best at it. Looking at your artwork, it’s ok. One can tell you are still an armature in the art department and what better way to improve than continuing to draw. Keep in mind, when you are drawing, use references. I understand some references are hard to find like background however anatomy references aren’t as scarce. Use that when creating scenes with your characters. \nSecondly, your story line is completely off. I mean, i think i get the concept but I wan’t drawn in. this may be due to your inexperience in telling stories. I can’t even tell you what it’s about because it came off to me as random dialogue floating around. I believe you attempted to explain the story from the main character’s point of view, but to be honest. I wasn’t following. You should consider checking other artist who have done this to understand exactly how to approach it. Use my work, for example. Since I Met You2\nAlso while reading, i noticed you do have good support from your audience. they seem to engage in your work, and that’s a good thing.

221,Detailed feedback to the first 10 posts (Comics only),Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'll be as thorough and whiny as possible.
This is for true masochists' only who don't like beating around the bush when it comes to constructive criticism.
I will try to follow this basic layout:
1) Name and Synopsis, initial premise for a new reader (which at that point I will be)2) Art style and possible improvements. (I'll try to stay as objective as possible, please take no insult in my advice. Also If you use clip studio paint and let me know in your comment, I can try to give you some tips on how to improve a little on that end.)3) Story and structure thereof. (It's pretty hard to confuse me, but if you manage to get it done you have far exceeded Christopher Nolan type convolution.)4) Characters. Who are they, What do they do, and what seems to be their motivation? (I'll be ripping apart your characters in an attempt to figure out of they're believable and compelling)
The amount of Feedbacks is capped, because I'm probably gonna read the whole thing and take it as seriously as a school assignment I'd like a good grade on with the goal of getting some good practice in myself. That being said, I still hope you don't take any as my comments the wrong way. We wanna keep it professional guys, not spur conflict.

The artstyle of the first chapter, or prologue clashes very hard with that initial impression tho by introducing glowing fantasy beings in saturated colors.\nThe Synopsis suggests a traditional hero's journey, I hope that holds true, I love those types of plot structure.\nART:\nIma start by noting what the initial impression is like and try to give comments on notable changes and improvements throughout the comic … or the lack thereof if that’s the case.The progress of the artist during their run is part of the greater plot, if you catch my drift.\nThe art style is impressive. mistakes in proportions keeping themselves to a minimum. The angularity of your character designs would surely look impressive in action and during fighting scenes but at first glance it makes it hard to distinguish between them  since they are almost glued to the screen during your first chapter especially.Zooming that far in on the action can actually negatively affect visual clarity and make it necessary to draw more details, which would defeat the purpose of a simpler style to begin with.\nI like a badass closeup of some dude kicking serious ass as much as the next guy but if there's too many panels in a row I can’t help but feel somewhat claustrophobic.\nAround Chapter 2 you seem to have desaturated everything quite a bit which really helps people prone to get a headache from seeing very bright, very saturated colours for a prolonged period of time.\nOn one of the characters there seems to be a toon link thing going on character design wise which really benefits from your personal approach to lineart and shading. Ironically I think he works best because he has the least amount of angulatity in his design\nChapter 3 gets a bit warmer in color scheme again. Paired with this crowded close up panel composition the characters almost look like they are popping out of the screen, hitting their heads on the panel borders from time to time, no offense. I get that this one had a sort of fire theme going. Towards the end of this chapter is also the first time the camera zooms out enough for me to enjoy the action. Have a cookie.\nOverall I can say maybe try to differentiate the backgrounds from the characters a bit more. Desaturate everything and reduce luminosity, so people in dark rooms don’t cook their eyes.Use chapter 2 as a guideline and just go a little further.\nTry drawing all the characters to a similar level of detail as the toon link guy from a design standpoint. Just a tad more curves here or there. I think the Halloween episode was quite on point in that regard.\nOn the rare occasions I was able to perceive a background existing within my peripheral vision it looked … ok. The cartoony style is very forgiving when it comes to those things. There were some good ones in there as well. Either good construction work or well done research on the artists part.\nSTORY:\nOh boy, where do I begin? So from what I could gather 3 chicks in heaven (reminding me more of Steven Universe rather than what I assume are supposed to be Goddesses?) lost one of their own.\nAt first they’re almost like:“Welp that’s it, can’t find her, too important, pull the plug boys, was a nice run. Let’s give creation another go.”Which personally, I can sympathize with but suddenly they pussy out and are like:“Ok fine, let's figure this out, like responsible omnipotent beings, jeez.”So they go for the next best thing and want to let super buff martial artists, which I assume, are known for their abilities to track down people? I’ll take it. Suspension of disbelief is still holding strong.\nAfter some lengthy dialogue, I wish I was able to classify as exposition those 3 chosen buff dudes, who I assume already have super powers, gather at some dojo and immediately beat up some mannequins for some reason. Seriously some of those strikes were more than preemptive. When the poor, defenseless automatons finally have the upper hand on the violent intruders some old dude pops up all:“Haha, you have passed my test, you are worthy of my exposition, hurr durr.”\nAnd thus they sit through his story and get on their merry way to collect the macguffins.\nStandard formula, don’t break what ain’t fixable, am I right? I like it.\nCHARACTERS:\nAt first I couldn’t help but wonder if this is supposed to be a story with 3 separate protagonists or if one of them is more special than the others, as I assume it’s supposed to be? Don’t quote me on that one.\nI don’t know they all seem to alternate between being passive protagonists and more active ones seemingly at random but maybe eventually, after a big enough sample size I could calculate which one is supposed to fit which archetype or a parody thereof.\nFor the love of me I’m just a little shy of my fifth re read and I still for the love of me cannot remember any of their names or personalities, so I shall name them thusly:\nTall and Skinny toon link … a.k.a the blind one:I like him, he seems to be kinda smart … sometimes … I like him\nKinn Crimson … a.k.a the ginger.Buffer than the others … Also, I think a girl? That name almost stuck with me because it can be used for both genders and the artstyle makes it look as if they might just have enormous pecs instead of medium sized boobs.I don’t judge, regardless of buff dude vs buff lady, I hope one day they too will grow a personality. I like it.\nAnd last but not least\nGirl … The girl.She has the coolest fighting scene in chapter 3. I like her.\nIf the characters were under any obligation, besides bragging rights, to follow the plot that literally got mailed to them I was unable to find it. But then again, neither did Frodo. Maybe you’re gonna get there once the backstories have been made clear.\nBut just in case, for the love of god, don’t let it consist of pure dialogue portrayed trough extreme close ups of their magnificent muscles."", 'I\'d very much like some honest feedback on my comic, especially in regards to the format!

The plot is gonna take some time to develop, since the premise was just barely established in the most recent update, so that section was a little hard to cobble together.\nFeedback: “The Purple Ribbon”\nNAME and SYNOPSIS:\nName sounds like a novel my grandma would read in her early twenties. No offense at all, she just really likes non fiction and romance thrillers but gave up on them once she discovered soap operas. And that’s the useless fact of the day, I guess.\nI’m a great fan of drama in comic form if executed well. But since I read so many of them I guess my standards have somewhat dropped over the years.\nART:\nFirst thing that struck me was the striking resemblance of the main girl with Katara in her underwear from Avatar the last airbender. Nice design I guess.\nIt appears you are using a single multiply layer for the shading with some slight gradients. Very nice and very efficient way to color your panels. Can just make for some really flat looking characters before one gets used to inking with 3d in mind.\nUnfortunately the more realistic the style the more apparent badly placed shadows get and make for some very inconsistent looking anatomy even if sketched out properly.\nSpeaking of anatomy. Your proportions could really use some work. Atms are quite long sometimes and shoulders kinda … varied … I suppose in your case it’s worth using the Clip studio inbuilt 3D models to mess around a bit. They can also help you ding out where to place shadows if you want to stick to realistic cell shading.\nYour understanding of verticality in the scrollable format is picking up real quick tho. The layout of the panels and the size of your text is quite pleasing to the eye and makes for a comfortable reading experience. Make sure you don’t cut the speech bubbles on the side of the gutter tho. Easily fixable in clip by using the text bubble pen instead of the ellipse bubble tool. Also second as a quick circle drawing practice every time you create your text boxes.\nI respect the voice to use textured brushes and what is either a good application of blurred photographs as backgrounds or some impressive render. When the backgrounds are done by hand tho it appears to be very inconsistent in terms of perspective. Lighting is surprisingly on point tho.\nMaybe use 3D assets for backgrounds or abuse the heck out of vector rulers … and vectors in general while you’re at it. Would definitely improve the anime / avatar stype line art.\nAround episode 13 there is a big jump in quality on the hair styles and facial expressions with some better proportions as well. Can still look a bit stiff at points due to the panel composition being unfavourably chosen for the perspective + facial expression combo.. Makes for some nice derpy faces that under certain circumstances I would deem worthy of their own meme, when taken out of context. I’d like to give an honorable mention to mister white bearded balding 12 year old in chapter 14. My sincerest condolences to that guy and his bad genes.\nI almost wish you would devote the same amount of time on each character's hairstyles though. Some of them look godlike while others make me question peoples skull shapes.\nAround episode 25 people start having actual toes and functioning hands. I suppose now make the eyes across the board a little more … round and less boxy and you got yourself that Avatar fanfiction with none of the bending we all desperately needed.\nOverall … I like your shading and your hair. They improved drastically over the course of 30 chapters. So did your hand drawing skills and proportions. Perspective is hard and so is consistency in facial anatomy. But you definitely are hanging in there and improving at a fairly rapid pace.\nSTORY:\nAlrighty then. First things first. Note that the first slave canonically introduced into the story is also the lightest colored person … if that’s not some unintentionally hilarious social commentary I don’t know what is.\nI’d call this story: what if that girl from the wholesome “Transported to another world Librarian edition” anime only ever made one invention … and was also a feisty streat kid … in appearance only, so far.\nIt’s a solid setup for a romance drama with vaguely comedic elements to it in a fairly grounded setting. Can’t help but get some sinister vibes from some of the characters … especially mister good looking white haired rich boy. That dude sketch. I kno he a good boy … paranoia strikes hard on that front. Something about how he treats his servants is very … Machiavellian. Can’t quite place it. Maybe it’s his posture?\nAnywho. Not much seems to have happened so far.Girl knows how to produce a certain die. I don’t know how she did it, at least there wasn’t any visual implication yet.Rich dude wants to buy exclusive rights off of her and get even richer at her expense. Tale as old as time.\nSome of the dialogue is a little grading … but alas … If the art improves this quickly one day it might be some serious eye candy, regardless of how interesting the plot is.\nWe got a little bit of a glimpse of the protagonists' home private lives.So far it feels like an extended prologue. Not bad as a start and I can’t help but mention once more. The improvements in the arts quality are pretty huge and are almost their own c-plot.\nCHARACTERS:\nYour names too shall be butchered, no one gets spared.\nTall lady in Katara cosplay … a.k.a Katalla … I’m so sorry.She seems nice. Has a family. Apparently knows how to purchase and consume bread … in addition to producing dyes that have unpleasant smells to them. She’s giving me certain tsundere vibes … but the good ones, so that’s a good thing.\n(not) villain in glasses … a.k.a Rich boy.As I said for some reason he strikes me as a nice guy about to go wrong. Something about him screams shrewd businessman with all the resources and nothing to prove. But then again, I might be wrong.\nAll in all. I think I need to subscribe to this one just to see where this goes from a visual standpoint … The story and characters will likely grow on me as that happens,At least the characters already have a personality even though they haven’t exactly had the chance to show it yet."", ""I'd be keen to get some feedback on mine!

In this...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""Alright. This one took me forever ... or at least it felt that way.\nFeedback: “Frequency Overload”\nNAME and SYNOPSIS:\nFirst I read the title and thought to myself: “Hmm sounds cool let me click on … OOOOH GOD my eyes.”I realize now that it's supposed to be a tv laying on its side but damn does it make for a visual clusterfuck. It kinda looked to me as if a really angry dude is blankly staring at the ceiling holding a notebook tightly … with some creepy thing laying next to him.\nBut yea. Use some vectors for that thumbnail and give it some love. Maybe make a layer set to screen and one to glow dodge to get that screen effect to pop. I’m pretty sure if you just made the TV square and had it standing there normally it would be more instantly recognizable. Give it some antennas.\nThe Synopsis was alright I guess. I’m no native speaker myself but I think there was a small grammar error in there somewhere. Or at least one that got mistranslated.The premise I’m getting from it is that it’s supposed to be some kind of trapped in another universe type story? Maybe? Or some brainwashing stuff maybe? Ah who knows, it’s a mystery aniways.\nThen I jumped into the first chapter and oh god I think that’s almost as hard to read as my first one. I’m reading this on a giant screen, zoomed in to 150% and I’m having trouble, now imagine someone on a phone.\nART:\nOh dear lord, I don’t know how to classify this art style. It has something reminiscent of old nineties cartoons made for music videos but with a vaguely nickelodeon / french cartoon vibe. But it’s still volume one right?\nAlso that paper background texture. I don’t know man. There is something almost intentionally unpleasant in that one. Are you putting that thing onto the canvas before you start drawing? Because either it's playing tricks on my eyes or your characters seem to kinda lean into the pattern a lot which messes with the proportions.\nWhen it comes to perspective, early on I’d say points for effort. Abuse the system using the 3D backgrounds. Quite a bunch of them are free and you can be used as a sort of guideline, you can still overlay your own style on top of it by right clicking the 3D asset after adjusting it to your liking, sort of like using a virtual camera, then selecting LT layer conversion and extracting the lines. After that you can just use the perspective you get as a guide and do your own thing.\nChapter 3 starts with some GIF’s. I like the style. One can do pretty nifty things with those. Makes for some good source of fourth wall breaking.\nHour two in captivity:The art is improving … so very slowly. The text is still small.How long are those volumes? At this point this feels either intentional or at least very consistent …. I respect that ….The little animations from time to time just make me wanna make more content for tapas and use the living crap out of that feature.\nWow, so That was it. All 46 episodes. Man I’m not looking forward to that second read through to be honest. The art got slightly better in a sense that line quality had become more consistent and the tone kinda stayed the same even if it was held together by the surprisingly gritty color scheme due to a dull colour palette and this nauseating paper texture permeating through the whole series.\nGot some hope when I saw the fist GIF but it has so far only been used for the rare special effect and once for one pretty sleep transformation / animation. That looked kinda dope.\nWhile the characters designs are actually fairly well done and distinct I can’t say if I can phrase this in any other way than: “Yo art sucks bruh.”\nBut there’s a good foundation there. You seem to like playing with things like luminosity layers and animations. The colors in themselves were well chosen and they stay very coherent throughout the run, would just be great if it were backed up by some more legit line art.\nThe text is … way too small. Some panels are pretty tiny but there’s sooo much space left in the gutter. If I’ve learnt something so far from making comics for webtoon it’s that readers are either too lazy or can’t be asked to use landscape mode.\nDon’t tell yourself that you have to keep it the same style throughout the entire series. Make one change at a time and your audience will thank you for it. \nAt least the panel composition would be pretty awesome if there was any semblance of perspective within it.\nOn the other hand if you took all your panels and then just ditched the side by side ones … maybe made them a little bigger, so they cover more of the screen, you could pull off a cheater transition. Make the whole thing more vertical and it’s at least more legible.\nSTORY:\nI can already see the only advantage of smaller text. More natural sounding conversations, God how much I miss those.\nOh god, do I have to?Ok … this is actually not so bad.The writing is believable since it's mostly colloquial language rather than big deep philosophical dialogues.\nThe kid characters are all good kids and behave like such.They do normal kid stuff, which is I assume getting into a convenience store and then hanging out at that other kids place, with the troned kid, or the two stoned kids?I don’t know man, one of them had super red eyes but the tall dude looks pretty stoner’ish, maybe a skater? Ah whatever. Quite wholesome so far.\nSo the glasses girl is the main protagonist. I like the choice, she’s bright, active, believable and kinda derpy. All good traits for a protagonist, I’d say.\nShe finds some book and a spoopy invisible ghost dude with a paper bag for a face … either that or it's the literal suitcase from pulp fiction. I like him, he’s got a nice carefree attitude.\nThere’s also this thing with the radio waves. Waves come, monsters appear, the kids around the block squad use the book to find out how to fight the monster … oh my god is this actually well written?It’s a monster of the week series but it’s better than half the random shitter stuff I suffer though on a daily basis.The characters all have their own distinct personalities and behave like reasonable people all without overdoing it with exposition.By the eight, could it be that whoever made this knows their stuff but just can’t do lineart for shit? As I said the colors and designs kind of work, and well … it’s just those lines man, but I digress.\nAlright. Huh … surprising … the second read though was not actually that bad …Or is Stockholm syndrome kicking in?\nCHARACTERS:\nHere we go. There are:\nGlasses girl … a.k.a the black one. She is nice. A real good kid doing good things. I think her family situation involves something along the lines of living with her uncle. But damn is she expressive. That’s what I call a personality. All the signs of a hero right there, who ever thought her up really did their homework.\nSunglasses girl … a.k.a the white one. If she’s a stoner she is one of those that would probably never share their weed. That one has an attitude. I think she’s supposed to be the cool one in the party … it shows … in a good way.\nThe dude … a.k.a the downer. I think he’s supposed to be the muscle … but he comes off like a complaining backseat gamer … which at this point I’m fully willing to claim is probably intentional aniways. I like him.\nOverall not bad … not bad at all.As soon as that art improves and the pages get a bit more legible without me having to devote an entire 30 inch screen to the comic to read it this could actually be decent.\nUse some vectors / a vector layer for lineart. Makes erasing stuff easier and you can edit the lines after drawing them, so stuff looks cleaner. Watch some more cartoons then pause when you see a certain scene that compels you and draw whatever’s on it for practice.Use reference, it’s not cheating.Drop the paper background or get a cleaner looking one. … please …\n… please ..."", ""I think this shall be the last one for today ... I guess I got almost to the halfway point. Hooray ^^\nFeedback: “To the Touch.”\nNAME and SYNOPSIS:\nWhen I looked at the name I already had an ominous feeling. When I clicked on the link I could see why … THAT kind of romance … oh boy here we go.I hope those episodes aren’t too long. Eh, at least it’s female on female according to the tag … how bad could it be?\nSince I’m not that much into classical myths the synopsis isn’t really doing it for me when it comes to an instant association with a pre existing story to set my expectations, so I’m mainly going off the second part of it that makes it seem like some kind of “artist falls in love with their nude model story”.I can get behind that one … sure.\nART:\nVery art housy style. Would definitely do well on instagram. Simple color palette early on only some occasional hiccups in anatomy when characters are standing certain ways, happens to all of us, looking at the ubermensch pecks captain america dude\nIf nothing else the style stays VERY consistent. Quite Painterly … wait are you writing the text by hand? If not that is one bad font … \nBesides the eyesore that is the text the art definitely looks like something coming out of art school. The kind of stuff you get forced to draw by the teachers in response to you telling them you wanna make comics for a living.\nThe proportions aren’t even bad, they are just highly stylized to the point where it would be enough to work some more on your hands and feet and the general stiffness of you poses, usually in panels where one seer most or all of the body \nSTORY:\nAs an artist … I really wish that was how to get a girlfriend … but then again, how would I explain to the police that I literally created her without giving them the wrong idea?\nWhy are they just doing normal couple stuff … not even the kinky way … more like the wholesome way …There are some deep implications of someone being able to create life out of nothing.Where is her birth certificate? Does she need papers? How old is she? Was she born legal?\nNobody visiting will question why there are thousands of nude paintings of some girl with questionable background laying around at real girls place?\nWhy would you rather acknowledge the existence of leg hair instead of asking the important questions, woman … actually I’m sorry for assuming. That was inappropriate ^^\nWell what can I say. It’s wholesome girls doing wholesome mundane tasks wholesomely with some melancholy dialogue sprinkled in and some serious sexual tension from time to time … I’ve certainly read more boring stories so far and enjoyed them.\nI like how it’s not gay just for the sake of being gay, like some of the more out there material.It has a nice somber vibe to it which is really being helped by the color scheme and minimalistic art even though that could still use some refinement. Some of the background would even be outright gorgeous … on a 5 inch canvas somewhere on a wall … I could definitely see that.\nCHARACTERS:\nReal girl … a.k.a. Literally God. One heck of a dedicated artist I guess. Basically created life … even though there were some suspicious voodoo shenanigans going on there. Not bad tho. Would have loved to see more of her lifestyle as a starving artist somewhere along the lines.\n“Real” girl … a.k.a. The walking obduction lawsuit. I’m not sure what myth she was based on but the only one I know that even comes remotely close went a little differently and I can’t help but see parallels to that one … Boy made a perfect likeness of himself out of clay and made a pact with the devil to make his clay clone work instead of himself, so he could laze around all day. Clone got angry about his … situation and chopped of his makers head and took it for himself to turn human.The protagonist was apparently so good at never using his head that he survived and took the clay head as a prosthesis, swearing revenge on his clone thus perpetuating the endless circle of violence between those two … Good tale. Fond memories …Yea “Real” girl is nothing like that. She is kinda like the most boring version of frankenstein's monster, just being ok and “meh” about everything and kinda just going with the flow sipping tea … I can respect that.\nOverall … Don’t make me read LGBTQ++AAA stuff again please. One of these days I will find a cringy one and your opinion of me will change forever ^^ This one was decent tho ..."", ""Your feedback was both very entertaining to read and extremely helpful!!

Game of Jade
Ares is a killer, but so is everyone else who chose to play this deadly game. Between 7 murderers, who's gonna make it out alive? Well, that doesn't matter to Ares. It's not like she cares about dying.    -(UPDATES EVERY WEDNESDAY)-





","[""Wow, I have to say that the beginning of your story is quite good, definitely among the best stories that I have seen on Webtoon or Tapas (I am not lying). So anyway, here is my review of your opening chapters.\nPros: \n\nYou began the story with a clear base description and entry into the plot, and you did it well. The opening did not feel overly long or out of place.\nThe Art style is aesthetically pleasing. It reminds me a little of Ava's Demon.\nEven though it is just the beginning of the story, I can already tell that Ares is going to be a tremendously interesting character with a well thought out backstory, based on her actions and what she has said. I already like her as a character even though we have so little info about this girl's past and motives. You have successfully established the protagonist of the story and cemented her key traits into the plot right off the bat.\nYou have brought up a ton of questions that need answering. When it comes to thrillers/dramas, this is in my opinion one of the most important qualities that they should have. Questions that are vague enough to be enticing and not mundanely answered at a random point.\n\nYou have given plenty of reasons for me to want to come back and see for myself if they have been answered. I want to find out for myself what the game's ultimate purpose is, what the pink haired ringleader's identity is, and what led Ares down this self destructive path.Thus, you have established the driver of your story, now only time can tell how successful you will be in escaping from the pit that the story will inevitably drive itself into (a trial all creators must undertake).\nThe pink haired boy (who I am assuming is an antagonist) so far seems to be my favourite kind of villain, someone who just shows up with no warning, so that we have no real idea if they are a villain or not, and who's actions are slowly unraveled over the course of the series. Then again, due to this only being the beginning, I guess I could be entirely incorrect about his character.\nCons:\nPerspectives look a little wonky in some of your panels. Not a major thing though and I'm sure you will improve in time (unless you are doing it on purpose).\nBiased personal opinions: \nI think that it may be a little awkward for Ares to get along with the (older looking) other characters. She isn't really at eye level with anyone in the comic so far. I really don't know if I should be mentioning this, but it just popped into my head and I decided to stick with it. \nAll in all, a very strong start for a story of this genre and caliber, something that I rarely see. I do mean this. My rating scale is as follows:\n0-1.9: Bad\n2-4.5: Under average\n4.6-6.9: Average\n7-8.9: Above average\n9-10: Exeptional\nI would rate your series as 7.5, based on what I have seen so far. It is a little difficult to rate your series more properly, because of how early on it is in terms of production.\nEither way, good luck to you with continuing this series, and I hope you upload it to Tapas soon, I will definitely subscribe (I would have done so already, but alas, I don't have a Webtoon account).\nAlso, just out of curiosity, which program do you use to draw 'Game of Jade?'"", ""Hello, thank you so much for your feedback! I use clip studio paint pro ^-^ Also, I'm not sure what you meant by the fact that it's awkward for her to get along with the older characters, is it okay if you elaborate more?? Thanks again!!"", 'I agree, really good start! This isn\'t my genre at all, but I enjoyed it and was intrigued by the characters. The art is really great - it\'s a distinct style that\'s gorgeous to look at and very well done. The use of color was very nice and immersive as well.\nMy thoughts as far as constructive criticism were:1. The series summary seems less professional than the series itself. I would recommend taking a look back at that, even if it\'s just to change ""gonna"" to ""going to;"" that alone would help reflect the quality of the actual comic better.2. The font used in the comic itself feels a bit... out of place? It works on the ""lines"" from the device, but it feels strange for character dialogue. Unless you chose it for a particular reason that will make more sense later, I\'d suggest finding something more meant for comics. This one looks to me like Arial or one of the basic fonts we see all the time, and I prefer something with a touch more personality for comics.3. Why are Ezekiel\'s eyes blacked out? I assume this will be explained. If not, it should be. Is this how other characters in the comic see him - with a mysterious black bar in front of his face? If so, I as a reader would appreciate it if someone would point that out soon, even if it isn\'t explained, just so I know that\'s a depiction of how he actually looks. Alternative explanations I came up with were some meta thing where the ""creator"" of the comic hated him so much they blacked it out, in which case the ""creator"" would eventually be revealed to be a character, who is now turning their experiences into a comic after the fact.\nThose were my thoughts, and I rambled quite a bit but they\'re all very minor things in the grand scheme of things. You\'ve got fantastic art, a great set-up, and intriguing characters. Great work!', ""Thank you so much, I'll take what you said into consideration! And I will for sure explain the points you mentioned in due time, as well as the reason Ezekiel's eyes are scribbled out (and whether or not the actual characters see him the same way we do as readers). As for the font, I agree with you, but I really can't find a fitting font :(( do you have any suggestions ? Thanks again!"", ""Like I said, it is a biased personal opinion of mine. I just think that the story may be a little more relatable if you include a character around Ares' age for her to talk to. It may be easier for the two to communicate with each other if they have similar teenage thought processes.\nThe older characters probably have their own issues to think about, issues that a person as young as Ares would have difficulty getting into. \nIt's your story in the end, so do what you feel is right. I'm just saying what I think would appeal to me.\nHowever, on second thought, not including anyone around her age group definitely invokes a feeling of being utterly alone and lost in a world of grown ups, which is probably beneficial for the tone of the comic. Not to mention the fact that Ares herself is obviously quite mature already."", 'I see! Thank you so much for clarifying ^-^', ""You are nailing it so far! I love your style, it's so cute, yet you've successfully made it so creepy and dark. The story is interesting, and I'm excited to see where this 'game' will take them all. Sub'd. \nI'm seconding the bit about perspective. I mostly noticed in on the top-down view of the skyscrapers. It's nothing immersion-breaking, but it's easy to fix. Clip has some inbuilt perspective guides, if memory serves. They're worth learning. (I'm just beginning to grapple with them in Procreate, for my own comic.\nI don't think it's weird that she's the youngest there, especially since you've established they're all killers. You haven't yet explored how she interacts with the others. My advice would be that, unless she's particularly mature for her age, they will treat her more like a child. Especially since she looks and dresses very young. 13 is a hard age to gauge maturity with, though. I teach some who are definitely still children, while others the same age are absolutely in the teenager headspace. You know your character best. Where you place her along the maturity spectrum will affect how the others behave with her.\nI'm also seconding that you should make another pass at the summary. I'll often gauge how good a writer is based on the summary alone, and a weak summary can put me off giving the comic a chance. The summary and cover are your first impressions to new readers. Make them as strong as they possibly can be. (Your WEBTOON cover is eye catching, I like it.)\nGood luck with your comic! You're off to a fantastic start."", ""Thank you! I'll rewrite the summary. Do you have any tips on how to make the summary stronger?"", ""\n\nyuumsarte:\nDo you have any tips on how to make the summary stronger?\nA couple of things.

Well, that doesn't matter to Ares. It's not like she cares about dying.    -(UPDATES EVERY WEDNESDAY)-\n\nTry to avoid colloquialisms such as gonna. They're fine in dialogue, or if you are writing in the character's voice, but feel a bit immature in a summary.\nAny numbers under ten should always be written as words, not using numerals. This is applicable up to one hundred, though that's a little more debatable.\nKeep the non-text symbols and clean and clear as you can. The upright divider line works well.\nI think the setting bears mention in the summary, because it's awesome.\n\nHere's how I'd adapt it, were it mine:\nIn the halfway place between life and death, a deadly game unfolds.

Although I will have to remove the first bit for plot related reasons.', ""Not much to say that hasn't been said already (I generally agree with BarBarKetrab and Kaydreamer), I just really like the art in your webtoon! I'm a big fan of the color palette and the textured look. Very neat character designs too. Keep going strong!"", ""Of course! You're welcome to it. "", 'I dig your comic a lot so far! I think the art aesthetic is really nice, and the genre is one that I\'ve been enjoying a lot the last few years. Dropped a sub  A few minor pieces of critique that I would give (beyond what\'s been said by others) are the following:\n1.) This one\'s really minor, but the word ""preliminary"" is consistently misspelled as ""prelimenary"". Unless this was intentional (it didn\'t seem so), I would consider revising that when you get a free moment. Otherwise the spelling throughout seemed solid though!\n2.) This is definitely a personal preference, but I would consider finding a slightly different approach to how you write sound effects. They seem to mostly be done with a semi-transparent textured brush. Most of the time when they\'re smaller or only have a single pass, they look fine (like this, for example):\n\nThere\'s a bit of an overlap at the mid-point of the P, but it\'s small and neat enough not to stand out. Some of these larger, more dramatic sounds that have you going over certain letters several times look a bit messy though. For example, these one stood out strongly (not in a positive way) to me as I read through Ep 2:\n\nScreen Shot 2021-02-08 at 6.29.09 PM.png459x619 252 KB\n\nScreen Shot 2021-02-08 at 6.29.13 PM.png435x655 256 KB\n\nThey\'re a tad messy, which the brush texture doesn\'t help with, and the brighter white areas where some letters have multiple brush passes inconsistently overlapping, like the ""R""s especially, look a bit off. The final R in the 2nd picture is perhaps the most notable culprit that caught my eye the most, but then I looked up at the rest of the letters and was like ""ah, they\'re all kinda like that"" xD \nMy recommendation would be to use a full opacity brush and then turn the layer opacity down after the fact if you need the letters to have that semi-transparent look to them. In cases like DRRRRR where you want them to have a rumbling look to them, maybe applying a blur effect, or 2nd less opaque letter underneath would be a good technique. That way the main letters maintain full readability, but you can still do different things with the effects~ I\'m not at my tablet at the moment so I\'ll try to convey what I mean below with a quick mouse drawing  \n\nIgnoring that I can\'t write well with a mouse..., the top example is just a normal round brush. Using that probably yields the best clarity but! I realize that using textured brushes give a different vibe and may work better with your comic (especially with the gorgeous coloring you have going on  ).\nThe 2nd example is just a full opacity textured brush of some sort that I randomly grabbed. By keeping the opacity at max you can still read it easily, although the texture gives the letters a cool look.\nThe 3rd line is the same writing from 2, but blurred with tools in my drawing program. That\'s one way to give that rumbling look while still keeping the letters opaque and relatively easy to read. \nThe 4th line is perhaps my favorite (and not something that I\'ve used before... but might have to now!). The main text is again, just the 2nd line copied down again. But all of the semi-transparent versions behind the letters are just it copied several more times and moved around at about 10% opacity. You still get some of that overlap effect that I talked about above going on below, but the ""main"" letters at the top are easy to read without any of that obscuring them.\nAgain, this is definitely just a nit pick though  It\'s not too big of a deal either way, just food for thought!\n3.) Lastly, this is another nitpick and not so much something that needs ""fixing"", but just to consider in the future! I\'ve noticed that you at times use these zoomed out shots with character silhouettes which give off a cool dramatic effect! But when I saw this panel in Episode 5 with the whole main cast standing together, it stood out how similar many of their silhouettes are relative to one another:\n\nScreen Shot 2021-02-08 at 6.47.03 PM.png875x660 240 KB\n \nAres is very different compared to all the others, but many of the rest have either similar outfit elements or hairstyles or sometimes both. For example, if 2 and 7 in this picture (counting from the left) were zoomed out and talking to one another, I would have a hard time identifying them. 3\'s fluffy jacket and 1\'s tutu are good differentiating factors, but both have similar hair to the aforementioned two as well.\nDefinitely another nit-picky food for thought thing though  Generally speaking I like all of the designs! \nBonus comment:\n\n\nKaydreamer:\n\nHere\'s how I\'d adapt it, were it mine:\nIn the halfway place between life and death, a deadly game unfolds. Ares is a murderer... but so is every other person who has made the choice to play. Out of seven killers, who, if anyone, will make it out alive? Well. Does it matter?

Lilah's Magic Shop: webtoons || 2tapas2
Hey guys! 
I need a second opinion on my webcomic, because my husband (who functions as my editor) and I disagree on whether or not I should switch the episode order for my story. Basically, I like it when stories kind of jump around in the timeline - there's flashbacks and it's not perfectly linear - and that's what I was trying to do with Lilah's Magic Shop when I started it. However, I'm now rethinking that choice because I feel like the first three episodes are pretty important in terms of establishing what the story is going to be about, and right now I'm not convinced the order makes the most sense. 
Option 1: Keep it as isThe argument for this (according to my husband) is basically that I'm overthinking it and that it's fine the way it is. And it might be confusing for current readers. 
Option 2: Switch Episodes 1-3 with 4-6My reasoning for this is because Episodes 4-6 actually establish what the story is going to be about a bit better, which is the whole adventure of Lilah figuring out what happened to her home. Since we see Lilah fleeing in episodes 4-6, that introduces the main conflict in the story, not the whole Mrs. Pumpernickel thing which is a subplot. Even though it's called Lilah's Magic Shop, not much of the story will actually take place there, so I think I started it the way it is now mostly to justify the title. (The title was chosen when the story was quite different, and it just kind of stuck even though the story changed.) 
Extra credit question for helpful over-achievers - do you like where Episode 13 and 14 are? Should they have come earlier?
Thanks in advance for your feedback!","['If your first episodes help establish who is the main character and get invested in her, i think keeping it as it is will work better.', 'I think 1-3 do a better job of introducing Lila as a character and getting the reader invested in her as a person, and the question about what happened to her parents gives more context to the flashback than it would have if it started that way.

","[""The cover of your comic is kinda misleading as the actual style is low-quality pictures that seems to be  upscaled 8 bit images resulted in data loss and not even proportions are the same. I mean the image quality, not the drawing, though I'm not a fan of this chibi-style, please  don't think that i'm criticizing your artwork.   Sometimes covers are more polished versions of the actual comic but this seems like a cover for a completely different comic entirely. while Characters in the comic is a parody to JRPGs - which  seems to be fun and some of them are drawn well  , most of their designs are  taken from SAO which is not good and I don't know which software are you using to make your images look so compressed and pixelated while some of them are fine. Sometimes even page size is not equal, try to put more attention to the overall quality and make the format it look as neat as possible.\nThere's also absolutely zero credit igiven to lettering or at least fonts size consistency and mobile-friendliness.I'd suggest finishing the story as you planned and check whatever ideas you wanted to put there to see how readers accept it and then start a new one with a more careful approach on comicmakig.But if you just want to continue like this you can change everything. after all, it's your story"", 'Thank you for your criticism ^^I also dont know how some of them\'s quality is good but some are just a mess..

226,"Critique, Feedback, and discuss my Webtoon Summary",Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello there! So I recently opened a topic showing my “Summary” but it turned out it was way too long. Now I’ve condensed it in 3-4 sentences keeping in mind important aspects and tips, pointed out in that prevoius topic from some really nice people!Here are 5 sample summaries I managed to do, after doing some research on famous manga and other comics:
Young Khan Wilheim is born with a curse that makes his body weak in a world where strength is everything. In order to prove his power in the Titanic Arena one day, he leaves his village in pursuit of obtaining magical armor, guarded by powerful monstrous creatures that shouldn’t exist in today’s age.
Ten years ago Pinestraw village was attacked by the fire continent’s elite group. The fire-wielding leader abducted the strongest warrioress, claimed the life of the village protector and many others. Today, the village is at peace and an aspiring young warrior, Khan, is struggling with a curse that renders him powerless. His goal may be to become the next Tzar Titan(the strongest warrior in the world), but his true destiny will be much more complicated.
As a child,Khan Wilheim vowed to become Tzar Titan(the strongest warrior in the world) after an attack on the village killed his father and abducted his mother. But his life changed when Khan found out he has a curse that drains his strength when wielding a weapon! Years later, still pursuing his goal, Khan sets out on an adventure to collect a legendary magic armor that will grant him immunity to his curse and give him the strength he needs to become the strongest…
Fifteen year old Khan Wilheim wants to be a warrior more than anything, but he’s got a curse that drains his strength completely. With no chance of ever leaving the village and exploring the world if he doesn’t become a warrior, his life looks more and more like a dead end. Then the village’s strongest warrior suddenly returned home, wearing equipment that boosts his power, he obtained from his travels, and said there is more. Much more!
In the land of Aegis, strength is everything. Warriors band together to incur ancient temples, castles, or dungeons, with dangerous creatures, who have recently appeared from the depths of the world, and obtain their magical armor and other spoils.Khan is an aspiring warrior, bearing a curse that negates his strength on contact with a weapon. Despite that, he vows to become the strongest warrior one day and leaves the village to obtain a powerful armor set that will regain his strength.
Let me know what you think. I am ready to do whatever I can to make this a genuine story. Does it need to be even smaller? Does it give enought information? Does it tease you enought for you to want more?","[""I've read all five of them, but... I feel that there are no real stakes to be seen here. Outside of the mc's curse that makes his body weak. You need to give the reader a reason to want to follow his story, why do we root for him? What can we expect? What is his destiny you are referring to?""]",2/6/2021 8:08,https://forums.tapas.io/t/critique-feedback-and-discuss-my-webtoon-summary/54574,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
227,Story Summary. Require Feedback/Constructive Critisism,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello everyone. To all of you who decided to take their time to read this and share their thoghts: I am very thankful and hope that with your help I can create a story for a Webtoon worth reading!
Here it is:
   Cold and snowy mountain tops spread across the continent Luft. Broken into several pieces that float in the air, they are called flylands. On the very top flies the highest one, blowing the strongest winds. Here lies the country Northa where a small village called [VillageName] is huddled inside a coniferous forest with trees that could be seen as high as 10 carts. People here are called Warriors, dressed in fur, skinned from their hunts, and also use it as interior for their medieval styled scandinavian architecture. Everyone who walks around has a sword, axe, spear, bow and other armaments, having well built physique, and hanging trophies of previously caught game. Some have fashioned wooden protection, while others use metal armor crafted from the one and only blacksmith in the village. Raymond Wiser and his workshop are respected by everyone and he does his job flawlessly without a hitch. His apprentice and nephew is not to be underestimated as he is a prodigy when it comes to innovations and crafting. Young Wilhelm Smith is very talented, but his dream lies outside this village. He wants to be the strongest warrior one day but from where he stands right now, that dream is impossible.   Wilhelm is one of the few in this world, born with an unexplainable curse, that renders him powerless whenever he touches a weapon. But he is determined to break it one day, and so he never stops training his body to become strong enough to one day wield a weapon despite the curse’s restraint. As the world suffered a recent cataclysm, from the ground cracks have arisen ancient cities and resurrected ancient enemies. If defeated in their domain, the treasure and magical armaments they guard goes to the victorious warriors, with which they gain a spell ability and increase their strength but most importantly, they can reduce the effects of Wilhelm’s curse. Warriors now gather in groups to raid and destroy the threat across the world, and the boy joins a group from his village when finally proving himself, but due to the group’s greed and hunger for power and glory, shortly he departs on his own way. While traveling, he makes friends who join him in forming a group to gather gear for their personal quests and desires while aiding each other.   On their journey, Wilhelm and his friends have found the invasion problem’s main source. In order to end the enemy’s tirrany, they must enter the most dangerous ancient city and destroy it’s pylon beacon to shut down all magical energy that empowers the mysterious creatures.","['Sounds like a solid setup to me. \nThough.... I\'m not sure about having a character whose name is basically ""Will Smith"". It\'s a bit too close to the name of the famous actor to feel really unique and iconic or not to sound like a joke.\nThe one other comment I have is that modern webcomics tend to be more successful if outside of just a great concept and artwork, they have really compelling characters and character dynamics. The success of this may be heavily affected by how interesting and likeable the main character\'s friends are and how much the audience gets invested in them.', ""In my opinion, I think your summary is too long. You have a lot of great world building information in the first paragraph. I don't get an idea of what your MC has to do with events that happens until the second paragraph and there are only  a couple of sentences that focus on him.\nThe story summary, like on the back cover or inside jacket, is supposed to tease what is going to happen in the story or what is possible in your world. Giving a description of where the characters live and how they dress, is not going to draw me in. It's great material for the actual story itself but not to draw readers in."", "" \n\n\nHate to drag your work, buddy, but it's way too long, especially for a webtoon summary. I need a quick hook, not an entire prologue! I'd generalize the hell out of it and condense all the appealing stuff into this. \nAn aspiring warrior with a curse aims to defend his hometown from beasts by charging into theirs.\nMaybe the sentence is a bit long, but you get my point lol"", 'Oh im glad you think its good!. WOW I really didnt see that with the name hahahaah. I am considering changing the name to Wilhelm Forge but might go on a whole different apporach. Thanks for that!', 'Oooh thanks im gonna try shortening it!', 'WOW that is really short but a good summary example! Do you think its ok to be this short? I will try anyway.', 'How’s This:\nI’m Sorry @ar-ninetysix for taking this from you but it seems good. Hope its ok:\nA boy, cursed to never lift a weapon, aspires to be the strongest warrior.An aspiring warrior, cursed to never lift a weapon, starts a journey to become the strongest warrior.\nI wanted to think of a third one but I need to go back to work and I think the first one is good but I need you guys to let me know. His whole end goal is to be the strongest warrior but The first arc begins with the Long summary I wrote above.', '\n\nkrislalev:\nAn aspiring warrior, cursed to never lift a weapon, starts a journey to become the strongest warrior.\nYou need an answer to the question... and why is it imperative that I drop a  million other free books to read about your warrior?\n‘Starts a journey’ is really generic. Frodo starts a journey, and so does Jane Eyre. \nShort, specific and catchy is what you want, 2-3 sentences, the essence of what you sell. It is called an ‘elevator pitch’, because that’s how much time you have to sell your novel to an agent in a hurry. Even less to a reader on the Internet.\nWhat’s so special about your protagonist? What he has to achieve? What opposes him? What happens if he fails? Why do we care?', ""I mean, you can add a little more to my example lol my main way of coming up with a summary is simplifying it down to like 1-3 sentences with the key distinguishing features. Mentioning the curse in the summary helps, but it's still a bit lacking. \nI'd suggest talking about what drives the plot. Why does he want to become a warrior? If the group is that important to his development, mention them as well."", ""I agree with the others here that it needs to be shorter. It currently reads more like a condensed prologue than a series summary. It looks like others have already said most of what I was thinking while reading, but at the risk of being redundant, short, catchy, and interesting is the goal. If there's no hook in the first three lines that show up in the preview box on Tapas (or whatever it is on Webtoons), before even expanding to see the full thing, it's going to be harder to hook in readers. Best of luck!"", 'Thank you everyone! I have a lot to think about and how I can condense the story into an Elevator pitch. I understand why it has to be so short. I saw my inspiration, Naruto’s summary, and it seems consists of 5 sentences but that was for a manga and not a webtoon and a long time ago as well. Things were different back then, i get that.\nNaruto follows the adventures of a teen ninja-in-training, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned at birth, Naruto is a practical joker who’ll do anything for attention. His grades at the Ninja Academy suck, and he’s shunned by most of the adults in the village.Naruto’s secret? His body is the living prison for the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon that almost destroyed the Village Hidden in the Leaves 15 years ago.\nI also read that the author failed Naruto’s first pitch as it was about a ramen shop, then he added demons on his second pitch, then he also added ninjas on his final one. Perhaps I need to re-think some aspects and elements and weather they are interesting and unique enough. @domisotto you have a really good point and really want to make sure i meet these requirements and answer these questions as I create the pitch.']",2/4/2021 6:05,https://forums.tapas.io/t/story-summary-require-feedback-constructive-critisism/54496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
228,Is My Writing Dry? [Novel],Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi! I've been working on a novel lately. Nothing special, just something that I can hop on and spew out a couple hundred words every now and then when I'm feeling stuck with other projects. That said, it does sort of mirror my usual writing style, and while re-reading I thought it felt a bit uninteresting. 
I'm now wondering if this is just my author-bias, or if I'm right and my writing is just bone-dry, and if so, if anyone could try to tell me why? Here's the novel below. Again, nothing special. So far it's just some setup for your run of the mill reincarnation/isekai Mushoku Tensei-esque story. I was thinking about engagement more on a technical level. Now, I'm finally done, so I'll shut my mouth... or is it shut my laptop?

I\'ve read the first chapter and I think your story has a decent framework but could use some polishing. For example in your opening paragraph, I don\'t get a real sense of the casino. Telling me the character spends his off-duty time there is a neat clue to their backstory, but I have nothing else to build a mental image in my head of him. \nA thought I had as I scanned other chapters, maybe a change of perspective will help ""spring more life"" into the piece. Maybe switch to third person? I\'d love to read more description to paint a mental image in my head than get a break down of ""I did this and I did that"". First person can work for your story but focusing on painting the scene will help shape the story.\nThose are just some of my first thoughts. Above all, trust your gut.

I don\'t know why I\'ve been trying to write in first person all this time. Probably influenced by something I read. Gonna take some time to reevaluate that decision.

I don\'t know if you watch murder-mystery shows, but a lot of the opening scenes have this moment where you\'re like ""oop, he gonna get killed"" because the victim makes SUPER obvious mistakes, like flirting with the wrong girl or sneaking off somewhere alone. If you paint the scene right, the twist at the end of the first chapter will definitely come as a shock.', 'Bone dry? Well, no.

A few thoughts...\nOverall, this is pretty solid for a manga fight comic. Your actions are pretty clear, your dialogue is legible, and your pages read in an easy way, and those are the biggest first hurdles to overcome.\nI think, if you\'re going to continue this comic, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n1 - Establishing shots. You have... none? I have no idea where any of these characters are in space. The gamers just seem to be faces and hands in a black void. Are they playing on a computer? An arcade cabinet? A giant high-tech gaming rig? Where are they playing? In an arena? A garage? Their mom\'s basement? Are they even in the same room, or are they playing in different locations on opposite sides of the planet? There is literally no way for the reader to know where these characters are in space, and that\'s an important thing to know. \nA similar thing applies to your virtual battle scenes. Your action shots are usually pretty good, but you need to take a few panels every once in a while to pull out and show the entire arena, and re-establish where the characters are in relation to each other in the arena.\n2 - Watch your black-spotting. There are a few instances with your ice skater avatar where you fill in the entire body with solid black, and it muddles the silhouette so much that it\'s hard to tell what is actually happening and what the character is doing. This panel in particular stood out...\n\nYou need to use your grey tones or some white separation lines to indicate what her body is doing, because it is not very clear which parts are butt and which parts are shoulder. So just keep an eye on that kind of thing going forward.\n3 - Speech bubbles. Yes you\'re doing a manga-style comic, so I know that you want to have manga-style vertical speech bubbles. Buuuutttt.... You\'re writing the story in English. So your speech bubbles should be horizontally-oriented so a horizontally-reading alphabet fits inside them. You wind up having to crop some of your dialogue in weird places to get it to fit inside your vertical speech bubbles, which makes it a little bit awkward to read.\nAlso, if you\'re using a comic lettering font, watch your use of the ""I"" with the crossbars. Typically in standard comic lettering, you only want to use the crossbar I for the actual pronoun I, as in, ""I am the best fighter around,"" and not as an actual capital letter I at the beginning of a sentence. It\'s a little thing, but it makes a lot of difference when it comes to being able to fit words in your speech bubbles and making it easier to read.\n4 - Little thing, but it looks like on page 28 or so, you still have blue guidelines on your page. Easy fix.\n5 - Slow down a second. Take your time. The entire 40+ episode is non-stop action, and that gets tiring to read. If you take a look at action manga like Naruto or Rurouni Kenshin, the combat scenes usually only last three or four pages at a time. Then the action stops, there\'s a moment of calm where we have some big panels without any dialogue, without any action, without any narration... Just a moment of silence. Then maybe some cheesy dialogue, some inner monologue, characters commenting on what\'s happening, then back into the action again for another three or four pages. Rinse, repeat.\nAnd probably the biggest thing...\n6 - I\'m not sure who I\'m supposed to be rooting for. Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Who am I supposed to want to win? Why do I care who wins? I don\'t know any of the players involved in this, so I don\'t know who I\'m supposed to be rooting for. Without some kind of emotional connection to the characters in the game, I really don\'t care who wins or who loses, which means the stakes of this entire battle are meaningless to me. Neither character really has any relatable personality traits, they both have the ""stoic cool guy"" thing going on, so there\'s no personality to hook me and make me like one of them over the other. And not even giving them names really doesn\'t help the reader connect with them, because it makes them feel like throwaway NPCs. \nIf you really want to push this story forward, you need to start with something that will give your protagonist a personality, and give the character some emotional reason to want that person to succeed. \nI\'d say you\'re definitely off to a good start for sure! But watch out for those things, and really focus on giving your characters character and an emotional connection to the reader, so the audience has a reason to care about what is happening.', ""Thank you so much for your review! I'll take all of your points to heart\nWith #6, I've definitely had that before... when I was writing it I really wanted to get into the action, but you're right I need to slow down and help the reader connect with the characters. I find it hard to introduce my main character."", 'I\'ll echo ninjashira\'s thoughts especially on establishing shots. I think my main critique is that I don\'t really get a sense of the characters and their motivations until the VERY end. I get the impression that Crazy Hair Man is the type of guy who plays mind games with his foes, and that Hidden Boss pretends to be cocky, but loses confidence in how he plays. But I could be stretching, there. Stakes are important here too. What does Hidden Boss gain by winning/lose with a loss? Same with Crazy Hair Man. How big is the tournament? Are the players in general big fish in a small pond or are these well-known stars?\nIt isn\'t exactly real-life accurate, but pacing wise, it might be a good idea to have a ""break"" between rounds so that the characters can interact with each other or internally monologue about their strategy. Think something similar to Dragon Ball Z/GT/Super, where they have breaks (even if they\'re small) between matches where characters interact and/or advance the plot. Trash talking is a great way to do exposition if you can pull it off.\nBIG PLUS on having an ice skating fighting game character. That\'s pretty great.', ""First off, super impressed with your comic! Some of the pages are a little text-heavy and have a lot of narration, but I do tend to like very few words per page, so maybe that's just me. The page layouts are very professional looking, overall great job."", ""@alcchron thank you! In my mind I was like 'get to the action, then deepen the characters' but I may have had it the wrong way round. Having a break between rounds is a great idea\nAlso thanks for noticing my ice-skating character, I worked hard on their movesets!\n@gabriellabalagna Thanks for reviewing! Yeah the text-heavy thing, I think so too, they way I have it set up is hard because you have 2 commentators + 2 characters all talking/monologuing."", ""@jamontoast98 I just remembered that I wanted to give you a reading suggestion. If you haven't read Angelic Layer by CLAMP, I think you should. It does a similar thing with players controlling combat avatars in a virtual arena, and it has really strong characters and a lot of heart. \nI highly suggest you read it and analyze the pages. Do a proper analysis where you break down how many pages are combat, how many are dialogue, how often they zoom out to give the reader an establishing shot of where everyone is in space, and how much dialogue and how many panels are on each page. Then compare that to the same stats in your own chapter. I think once you see those numbers, it might help influence your pages for the better."", 'Thanks!

I feel like the characters are going to need to rely heavily on their wits.\nOne thing that stood out to me was the short, but very telling descriptions of your characters. I like to use the term: Saying a lot without saying a lot, and your descriptions manage to do just that. Overall, very well done. I'll have to give this story a closer look in its later chapters.\n@ApplesOverIndia - I really love the initial premise of your story. I love the humor, I love the sass of Mitta, and I love Margarita's internal dialogue. Like everyone else I'm basing this off the first chapter, but yours is definitely hooking me enough to give a full read when I get a chance. That said, a few pointers:\nOne thing that's often suggested but necessarily so is that you should start a new paragraph everytime someone speaks. This helps a lot with the sentence flow and makes things a little easier for your reader to immerse themselves. I realize only one person is speaking, but the way you have the internal dialogue going, you can have that internal dialogue in a paragraph by itself, and have it flow a bit better. Otherwise, you did a great job hooking me as a reader, and I'm very interested I what kind of trouble these two will be getting into"", ""For mine I'll let you choose any of the three I have up. They're all part of the same series but the stories themselves are vastly different. You can find them through the episode list, but if I had to pick one as an example of my work I would highly recommend Brooders, the most recent one.

231,Seeking/Offering Cover Feedback,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'd like some feedback on my cover. I created it long before deciding to post on Tapas, and it doesn't match the ""typical"" cover style I see on here. Most covers that I see seem to be fairly busy and feature fairly intricate art, usually showing the protagonist. Mine is very simple and stylized. Personally, I like it and feel like it stands out. However, I'm also going to be biased because I made it; it could be standing out in a bad way that looks amateurish. The image is below, and then I ramble a bit about why I made the choices I did. Feel free to go ahead and form an opinion before reading my explanation, because it should stand on its own without an explanation. At the end of the day, the questions is: Is this intriguing? Does it suggest that the story will be well-written? Does it look professional?

2 Cover.jpg960x1440 986 KB

Explanation: My novel centers around two girls who drive off together and leave their lives behind. Throughout the story they dye their hair a couple times, and the changing hair colors represent their personal growth and, especially in the case of the narrator, becoming more comfortable and confident in herself. It's a very symbolic thing. I chose to represent one of the iterations of their hair on the cover to emphasize this, but I also (obviously) omitted their faces. The two are strangers at the start of the story and know nothing about each other, but it's obvious from the get-go that they both have a lot of secrets that they don't want to talk about. By omitting the faces, I felt it kept a sense of mystery suggesting that you don't really know who they are. There's not much technology in the story, so the handwritten font matched well with the overall vibe and the Polaroid feel.
As for the style, I am NOT an artist. However, I am a graphic designer. I chose a style that I was capable of producing and that I liked, which was this. I liked that it was simple, clean, and very bold at a glance. There's not much room for question about what it's depicting, no matter how small it shows up on mobile. I've seen some excellent covers on here that are fantastic when viewed large, but on mobile, so much of the detail gets lost that it's no longer striking. I may not have designed this with Tapas in mind, but that was part of the reason I didn't consider changing it when I did decide to start posting on here.
I'm happy to give feedback on other people's covers if you leave some for mine - as I said, I'm not an artist, but I do work in graphic design so I have a good sense of layout, color, font choice, etc.","[""The cover can't suggest that the book will be well written- It doesn't look as professional as it could, though. I suggest just finding a picture of a polaroid on Unplash or something and making it in Canva.\nIn my opinion, it's a little dark- It's not as eye catching as some covers are."", 'Having read the first chapter of your story (with the intent of returning to read more) I can say with confidence that your cover matches the tone and feel that your story is going for. Personally, I like the simplistic nature, and I feel like the font choice was on point. The hair itself I\'ll admit is leaning slightly into the ""too simplistic"" realm, but that\'s more based on the coloring in regards to how it blends with the background. I think if you made the outline for the hair on the right a bit darker and darkened the blue a bit for the hair though, it would work out very well for you.\nOverall, I think it\'s a great cover, and I would keep to the same theme if you were to make any adjustments. It needs to be tweaked a bit, but not replaced by any means. You have a lot of potential in terms of both story and art ', ""\nghostoast:\nIn my opinion, it's a little dark- It's not as eye catching as some covers are.\nI agree with @ghostoast here. It's kinda plain and not very eye catching aside from the bright blue hair. The dark background is busy in an weird way, and I can't put my finger on it. \nI think what puts me off is that there isn't really a theme or an indication of a genre. This could be a romance, horror or coming of age story, I can't tell. It looks like it's supposed to be the front of a journal but there aren't enough details to make it believableAdding a polaroid motif somewhere on the cover may lend to a theme. Also I think there can be more polish to the hair unless its supposed to be in a more sketchy style, and even then you could lean into that more. Maybe the hair could look more like they're stickers?\nI think the font choice is good and it fits what you seem to be going for."", ""Couple thoughts - I like the simplicity, and I think the font and the background mesh well together. I agree with you about simple/clean/bold. In terms of looking professional, I think the hair icons can work, but maybe these could use some tweaking to get a more professional look. I'm no expert of any sort, and definitely not covers lol, but I can give you my gut reactions/where I think I would start.\nHair vs. background - you have rendered noise in the background with flat/shiny feel to the hair and it clashes for me. You could still have the outlined hair standing out from the background, but might consider a textured overlay at a very low opacity to mate them a bit better.\nComposition - I'm just a little off balance with the long hair and short hair lined up at the top so that the negative space below the shorter hair feels empty. I think the overall cover would feel a bit more balanced also if all the design elements were shifted up a bit. Negative space weighted towards the bottom feels better to me, but disclaimer I'm definitely not a graphic designer, so that's just a personal opinion . \nHair texture (the most effective change I think you could make) - the lines and highlights feel a bit random and they cross in ways that make them less believable as elements of hair. I think you could remove or reduce one or the other (or even both) or align them more so they feel more like a description of the hair rather than lines that are sitting on top of the silhouette."", '@ghostoast A valid option, though I have an intense personal hatred for stock photos (that I realize is unjustified but here we are). \n@hippieghost Thank you! I\'m happy to hear that it fits the story (and thank you for reading!) When you say ""darken the outline,"" what do you mean? It\'s currently a white outline, so do you mean a thicker/bolder outline, or make it a dark color (like black)? \n@IndigoShirtProd I did intentionally put a kind of grainy texture on the background; leaving it plain looked really weird to me, though it never occurred to me to try putting the texture over the hair as well. The style of the hair was mainly determined by my artistic abilities, and I\'d like to polish it more if I could figure out how \n@migxmeg I\'ll try overlaying the texture on the hair - I don\'t think I ever tried that. For spacing, I originally had my name under the title so everything was kind of sitting on the bottom instead of floating awkwardly in the middle; I just didn\'t think to change it when I removed my name for Tapas, but I definitely see what you\'re saying. I\'m having a hard time visualizing what you mean for the hair lines/highlights. My thinking was ""hair is random and crosses over itself, so these lines should too."" If I recall correctly I initially had carefully placed lines that didn\'t cross and it looked super weird to me. I\'m sure there\'s a way to do it better, but my brain is struggling.\nThank you everyone for the comments! When I have some time I\'ll play around with it again in Illustrator and see what improvements I can make. I appreciate the feedback!', ""I mean like a dark color to blend it in a bit better.

And for Era not being able to handle Vana and her friend but fought a bear lol that was funny; The bear was mostly taken down by Era’s friend whom is better fighter than she is but that isn’t explained until a future episode. Really glad you noticed little things like that though.
For future episodes I’ll keep establishing shots and where things are in a scene on my mind as I draw, perspective is something I’m continuing to work on so again I appreciate all the critiques even those you referred to as nit picks.","[""I'll review your comic for you.

I'll get it to you in a few hours at most."", 'Okay I reviewed all of the first and the second chapter; also just for reference I read the chapter 1 prior to you redrawing chapter 1.\nFirst I really like how you depict action especially in the Ice Temple in chapter 2. I wasn’t confused about who was where, what was happening and where Elliot was at or doing in any time he was on a panel. Fight scenes are really hard to depict right but you have a knack for it as well as depicting characters in motion. One instance of this was when Elliot Lara and Tyler were sliding down the ice slide. I know it’s a very quick panel but it’s those little things that make action scenes great which being a primarily action genre it’s best if someone nails\nHowever for critiques I don’t think you should brush off the work you did with chapter 1 prior to it being redone. I actually the pacing for the original chapter 1 oppose to the remake. While both have similar beats little things are littered in the original that I really like. Tyler’s obsession with the game store showing he’s the jokester of the group early on, Elliot walking into school and having a short dialogue of random students in the school asking if he will be making it to meet up with them “this afternoon” where Elliot says he can’t due to having a sparring match (depicting Elliot is in fact a regular school student that has other responsibilities outside of the main narrative’s plot). I’m huge on character and this really grounds not only Elliot but his friends as well because we also meet up with them right after this scene in school. I know it’s such a short and little scene but it made me prefer the original a tad more than the remake just due to being a character nut. I’d read a comic of stick figures if the character and story were amazing. \nI’ll word it like this. The remake pushed the plot along but while the original also did that as well, it made small time to show off the main trio and little character traits and character interactions. \nAnd random but my favorite is Tyler haha.\nOther than that I still really like it, especially chapter 2’s opening with the trio climbing the mountain and Lara contemplating why the hell they are even doing lol.\nAll in all, solid comic and glad you still kept the original to be viewed and compared to with the remake... never remove it lmao', ""Thanks for the review!\n\n\nReveal:\nFirst I really like how you depict action especially in the Ice Temple in chapter 2\nThanks a lot!

I know it’s such a short and little scene but it made me prefer the original a tad more than the remake just due to being a character nut.\nI liked that scene in the first pass too, though it was a product of my mindset around the comic. Originally I was only going to do 5 chapters (all of which place over the course of a week, Thanksgiving break to be specific) and end on a cliffhanger, where I had more room for less plot relevant material. But in then I got some critiques that expressed that the relationships between the main characters was not well shown. I decided to do a full run of the story and continue after chapter 5. I scrapped the high school scene because those characters would never be scene or heard from again and made the focus more on the trio. And then there are reoccurring jokes and characterization details that show up again. \n\n\nReveal:\nAnd random but my favorite is Tyler haha.\nTyler seems to be the one that sticks out to people, yea.\nI like my first iteration of chapter 1 for what it is and thanks for the reassurance that chapter 2 isn't as bad as I've made it out to be.

However, just the day before classes begin she runs into a mysterious being from another world claiming her world is in the brink of destruction. As if starting sophomore...\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""I read everything you have, but I'm only going to focus on the The Thief one-shot. I'm gonna mainly go through scene by scene for things that stuck out to me.\nSetting a SceneSo the one-shot begins in a generic forest. We don't know the name of the forest or where it's oriented geographically. Now, that's not particularly a bad thing, but it doesn't help the reader understand what is going on. This scene would've been helped with an establishing shot showing the forest's relation to the village it sits beside and with the introduction of a landmark. Take the swamp episode from Avatar: The last Airbender. The swamp that is the focal point of the episode is treacherous and confusing, but what makes the setting memorable, other than the characters, was the big spirit tree at the center of it. That tree gave the viewer something to refer back to if they were confused during the episode and it made the swamp stand out against other forests the viewer might have seen in other media. I feel as though if you came in with an establishing shot to show where this is all taking place and a landmark, whether that be a big tree, rock formation, or another point of importance, the reader would have an easier time settling into world. You can even draw the reader in with sound effects of Era killing the bear then hard cut to her feeding the cub before moving on with the rest of the scene. Speaking of...\nimage.png364x562 22.8 KB\nPersonally I think a gradient from white to black behind the panels would've done well to add to the emotion of the scene and not made it look so sterile. The sizes of the panels could be larger too.\nThis is one of those things where you have to problem solve to get the best readability. Again, another establishing shot would've done well here. When I first read this scene, I though the person shouting at her, was coming from beside her, not behind her, so I was confused when she did a full 180. If when starting the scene, we saw Era from a profile view, I think it would've been more understandable where all the characters are standing in relation to one another.\nGeneral ArtworkI won't spend too long here because artists are usually aware of the  things they need to work on. Perspective is a major thing that stood out to me. You can sometimes fudge the perspective of a scene by making the things in the background drawn in thinner lines than things in the foreground, but here, things just look very flat.I commend you for doing a black and white comic; working without color can be more difficult because now you have to focus on the value structure of your characters and how they compete with the backgrounds. Which why the above panel is so unfortunate. I circled four points in this panel where a reader would have a hard time understanding the scene due to a problem with value and perspective.1) ValueThe trees in the foreground, the hair of the girl, and the night sky are all the same shade of black, the same value, meaning they all blend into one another. This disrupts the visual hierarchy of the scene and makes the scene harder to read. I'm assuming you're drawing the line art traditionally, scanning in, then coloring the scan digitally. Give yourself some room to mess with the values, you only have three so far: black, white, and very light grey. There's more than that available and be sure to use those value to set a scene. If something is going on at night, most every thing should be in darker values. 2) The OwlLet's talk about that owl. Because the values surrounding the owl are all the same, it looks like there's a giant owl floating in space. I get that it's sitting on a branch in the foreground, but at first glance it does not look like that. The owl just seems too big for where it sits on the page. And this is another value thing, but the stark contrast between the light colored owl and the dark background (coupled with it's big, piercing eyes staring right at the reader) is enough to distract the reader from what's going on in the panel. Plus, the branch the owl sits on has a tangent with the bushes in the background, messing up the visual hierarchy and the perspective even more.3)  PerspectiveThe background confuses me. Later on you say the forest is dense. . . but it doesn't look dense at all. You can see the moon and stars (the first indication that this is night time since everything else is framed as though it's daytime and there are no  establishing shots informing us of the time of day) through the trees. But at the assumed perspective would mean you could only see more trees and foliage through the tree trunks, but we don't get that. The moon and stars should be high above the canopy, but instead they're caught beneath the branches. There's not much I can say in terms of advice other than practice drawing things in perspective, learn about vanishing points and the like.\nPersonal Nitpicks (you can skip this if you want)I don't understand the clothing choices and I can't tell what they are supposed to tell me about the characters. The clothing doesn't inform me about the setting, the village or the forest. I can infer their ages a little bit, but I'm likely wrong due to how the characters themselves are constructed with bigger heads and eyes, and smaller bodies. And they, well Vana and her friend, are able to fight, confusing me more about their ages. The clothing is juvenile for all parties so I though they were kids in the 8-10 range, and it looks like clothing straight out of the early 2000s. There's nothing wrong with not knowing the ages of characters when reading, I don't even mention them in my comic, but artwork is all about communication, and things are getting lost in translation for me. I really don't like to the eye shines, like the little half circle in each eye. I think I'd be less bothered if the eye shines were always part of the iris/pupil and not drawn in the corner of the sclera. And what was up with the random Korean lettering (I'm assuming it's Korean), very distracting.\nAction\nimage.png551x516 60.2 KB\nThe action scene wasn't bad, just a little confusing. I liked how Vana broke out of the panel and the panels were tilted to flow with the action. Good stuff! The confusing part came with the orientation of the characters.In the first panel, Vana is running up from behind Era. We don't see her jump. Then all of a sudden she lands a kick on Era's face from the front. It feels like as you were drawing the scene, you lost track of the characters and to make up for it, panels weren't included that would've further confused the reader. So careful when you write these scene. I recommend drawing an overhead view of the setting for yourself so you know where everyone is and how to orient them when they fight one another. Always refer back to previous panels so that you don't forget where everyone is. And add more sound effects, add some energy to the fighting.(wait she can take out a bear but not two girls?)\nWhew! That was a lot. I can see the effort in this project and I commend you for that. I didn't really talk much about the story because it is a one shot that  was more about establishing a point in a character's life than getting into a full story. All of my critiques were for the sake of making the comic more readable so be mindful of some of the things I've mentioned and good luck!"", 'Thanks for the review Indigo, really appreciate how in depth you went with it overall;  Little things even I didn’t notice and I’m very critical of my own work, you noticed so really commend you on your eye. \nAnd yeah for future episodes I’m definitely gonna keep in mind how to set a scene and where characters are within that scene. Sometimes I do get lost and with fight scenes knowing what is happening and who is where is important. I started the series with a simple fight scene just to get a hang of it for future scenes similar to it.\nAnd Didn’t even notice little things like Vana being behind Era and the owl being slightly distracting. \nAnd as for Era being able to kill a Bear but not fight Vana and her friend, lmao that was funny; In a future episode it shows Era’s friend actually killed the bear due to him being a far capable fighter than she is. \nAgain I really appreciate the review, keeping it in the back of my mind going forward; thanks again', 'You mind if I review your comic, even though you reviewed mine not too long ago? I want to return the favour.', 'Whats up dual, that would be cool; wanna know your take', ""Ok so I took a look at your comic. I'm a little confused as to the chronological order of the episodes since the first two seem to take place in a later time than the Thief oneshot. But I assume that's probably an episode you made after the two episode shorts.\nI think my biggest gripe is most likely the lack of any knowledge going into the oneshots or shorts in general (mostly the oneshot because the shorts are just that; shorts, for comedy). \nIn the oneshot we see Era feeding fish to her friend Cawdigon. And all of a sudden these two characters appear, call her a demon and proceed to beat her up. And as we read through the fight we learn that Era stole food to avoid starving. But we don't know where she stole it from or what the reason is why she has a shortage of food. On top of that, there's also this nightmare she has before waking up in what is (I assume) her home which is another thing I'm wrapping my head around, if I didn't know any better I'd say it's a past event of some sorts that caused her trauma.\nI think the direction the story is going into is pretty decent so far and we do get a bit of a view on the situation Era, Karo and Cawdigon are in. There is room to explain the world they live in naturally through conversation and that could shed some light on the stakes of the story and how everyone fits in.\nI think Indigo touched on the art feedback already, so I won't really go into that too much. I do like the way you draw hair (mostly because it has a bit of similarity to some of my characters xD)"", 'Hey dual really appreciate the Review,\nAnd yeah the first two episodes are non canon shorts that I made to get use to kind of gauge a audience before the actual one shot story was ready.

Don’t like dropping huge lore dumps so it will be bits and pieces here and there. \nOh and for Era and the bear, that bear isn’t Cawdigon lol, just a random bear whom lost its mother. Cawdigon is Karo’s spirit toy, won’t delve too deep into that but they are different characters, really nice eye though; someone else mentioned that in private messages and had to tell them too. They do look similar now that I took another glance at them haha\nAgain really appreciate the review Dual, it was great and will keep a lot of it on my mind going forward', ""No problem , and I agree, I'm not a fan of huge lore dumps too xD so I understand what you are going for""]",1/30/2021 7:11,https://forums.tapas.io/t/review-exchange-1-1-3/54289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've left a comment about how it reminds me of the beginning to Mr. Burns, a post-electric play. The initial intrigue is rooted in finding out how the world got to be the way it is and how the inhabitants are surviving, but quickly redirects to the shorter stories told by the group of survivors. It reads as a character study more so than a traditional story-telling format, which I enjoy and think is interesting. \nThe introduction scene paints a good mood/tone. It's heavy and hopeless, but in a nihilistic sort of way.\nThe characters themselves are comedically unlikable (unsympathetic might be the right term? They're charmingly infuriating). Sometimes the arguing gets to be a bit repetitive and focuses too much on a single insult or phrase, which slows down the flow for me personally. \nI'm interested to see if one of these character had a hand in bringing on this apocalypse.

I'm new at drawing (half a year experience). I usually write for myself. I want to improve. 
I welcome any suggestions feedback or criticism even if you say ""it's just shite!""
Anything for readability, accessibility, structure, pacing, story, anything that strikes you.
The chapters vary in quality,  I'm learning as I go. I remade the beginning since the original one was atrocious not only in art but in understanding. Right now, I'm trying to learn how to do backgrounds and landscapes since I realized the story requires a lot of settings.
Synopsis
The A.I. won the war when it figured out how to hack the resistance’s bionic enhancements.
In a last ditch effort the ‘No Steel' project launched, with the hope of creating humans, strong enough to face a mech.
The project was never completed. Fearing the A.I. could learn the basics of genetics, all volunteers were launched into space.
Many years later, 'Fall's stasis casket lands on a distant world.
With nothing left, he lets go of the past and tries to survive on his new world.
But this second chance, might be a new chapter of the Mech War.

239,Need some feedback for my new novel,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, I recently updated a new WIP novel here on Tapas and would really like to get some feedback on it. (Pretty Please  )I normally write western Y/A stories but this is a first attempt at something Manga-like, and so I am just not very sure if it is done right.
Title: SurvivanceGenre: Action-fantasy
Link: https://tapas.io/series/Survivance-DIREGAMES113
Thanks a lot in advance ","['I\'m not sure what you mean by ""manga like"" since this is a novel and not a visual style.   \nAnyhow, I noticed no one got back to you yet, so I read the first episode.  Here are some of my thoughts.\nFor the Writing\n I think you could benefit from more details and sentence variation.  There are too many short, clipped sentences and while this lends itself well to the action genre, it makes it hard to understand exactly what is happening.  Mix longer, more detailed sentences with shorter ones for contrast.  There is also very little sense of where the character is or any other sensory details besides their pain (which they wouldn\'t be feeling, but please see below).  Simple descriptions of what is happening around your character can help immerse us in their world and associate with them more. Though I will give you credit here:  your episode lengths are perfect.  Nice short bits that are easily digestible and exactly what Tapas is all about. \nContent\n I would strongly recommend some light research.  I\'m not usually a stickler for exact realism in fiction, but there is a fundamental misunderstanding of seizures in this writing, and as a central aspect of your novel they deserve to be depicted correctly.  Seizures are not painful.  There are different types of seizures ranging from stiffening, relaxing, and short jerking motions of the body.  People who have partial seizures are known to talk and move, but what you seem to be describing is not a partial seizure, and therefore your character would not be able to move or talk, though they might be aware of what is happening around them. Understanding seizures is crucial to understanding your character, and the inaccurate depictions took me out of the story at a time when I should have been sympathizing with your MC. \n\nAnyway, I say all of this not to discourage you, but to encourage you to hone in on your craft.  I would love to see more action/ fantasy novels take off and succeed.  Good luck!  ', 'Read the chapter & can find nothing to critique, really, other than just differences in style.  Whups, there\'s more to read....\nSmall technical things... Funny how small things take a lot of words to describe........\nIn Ch2: ""permanent-bone dislocation"" doesn\'t need a hyphen.\nAlso Ch2, the line ""Do you even remember your educational qualification?"" was paragraph spaced from Bobby\'s previous sentence (about toil for the next decade). Normally, a paragraph space like that is used to tell a reader that the speaker has changed, but this time it didn\'t change. I\'d put that line in the same paragraph right after ""he asked.""\nCh3, where the STATS appear... there\'s a little trick that will keep the lines closer together for a better appearance. I\'m assuming you paste the new text into Tapas vs typing in Tapas. Right? After you paste in the new text, go back & replace the \'returns\' with \'shift+return\'. The line spaces will be much smaller & look like line spacing vs paragraph spacing (as it does now).\nCh3, where Manager is re-briefing Kris, Manager speaks for a long time, leading to paragraph breaks, which normally cue a reader of a speaker change. But... according to the writing gurus... if we end a paragraph of speaking without an ending quotation mark, it means the speaker continues in the next paragraph (which begins with a quotation mark). I learned that the hard way & it seems a minor technical detail. I\'m not even sure if people do it much.\nSorry for so many words.....', ""Alex pretty much hit the nail on the head. As an EMT I can confirm a seizure wouldn't cause pain like that unless you're writing in a fictional disease that someone causes painful seizures to happen. I would either focus on his disorientation by taking advantage of the shortness of your sentences, or make it clear in the beginning somehow that this is no ordinary seizure. I think the lack of details is okay for your first chapter. He's disoriented, the focus is on him, but in the second I would advise heavily to add descriptions to help immerse your readers into the scene.\nBeyond that, I like the bond you have between the siblings. Even when they're arguing, the strength of their care for one another is clear, and that's a strength you can build on."", 'Thank you for taking time to give the feedback.

240,"Struggling with my comics, any advices about this?",Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi! Thank you for stopping by. 
It’s been almost a year since I started my comics, can’t say I post regularly (I really do this as a hobby), but I’m pretty happy on how I improved it by the time. 
But, I still think almost everything is wrong about it. I spend numerous hours on each page for quite a boring result, each page is really short comparing other webcomic here, and I’m not sure if the story is interesting enough for people to follow it. This project will probably take years to end fully, it’s quite a long and complicated story, I just want to give enough at each page to keep the interest. And with around 4 views by page, I’ll probably not receive any advices in the comment section for now, that’s why I post here.  
In the drawing part, I’m voluntary changing my art style each chapter to improve fully until I find the one I want to stick with. I’m mostly searching advices for the story telling / webcomics format part. If you have any course/advices on this subject, it’ll be gold to me.
Thank you a lot.

While waiting for April  | Tapas
While waiting for April is a slice of life comics, following different characters and stories each chapter. 

Everything come from April’s mind, a girl from an other world, Lilanim, waiting for her brother to come home. 

All stories are related...





","[""I looked at your comic and maybe I found some reasons why people don't read it that much. This is however based on my personal experience, so I hope other people will also try to help you. First, I was quite lost in what is happening. I also had this problem with my old version of comic. When you throw reader into the story and things just move, but as reader you have no idea who is who and what is happening. We were in desert, then in the room and then there was some guy. And before we could learn something, it jumped to other chapter with different story. I know it probably has reason and story will explain everything later, but people usually don't come back if they get confused at the beggining. \nNext big thing are the pages themselves. When it comes to page numbers per updates, many people upload only single pages. I personally started to post more, because it's easier and better to read, but it depends on artist. You also jumped from the classic comic format to scroling format. I think the original format looked better. It looked like a comic, but later it was brown backrground with pictures. Even the most stupid and simple thing as panels and how they are ordered tells a story and can hook up a reader. Try to look at your comic and think about how to make it more engaging.\nAnd last thing, don't change artsyles. It may be fun and experimental, but it can confuse people, because suddenly they feel like they jumped into some other comic. If you really want to make this as serious project, I suggest to create one specific style that is yours and practice it. It takes years to master even one, so if you jump to new ones every month, things will never look that good. And let's be honest, when people look at comics, art is the first thing they notice.\nI hope this can help you somehow. Again, it's my opinion and I want to help you, because I think you have potential for great comic and you can get more readers and recognition for your work.\nI also subbed so I can keep an eye on your comic."", 'A good way to set pacing for a comic is to have the entire story or at least a whole act/arc/chapter planned out or scripted before you start to storyboard pages. This can help you break down how much to put on a page. My method is as follows: Whole story outline > at least 25% treatment (description only expansion of the script) > Chapter script (in writing I split the treatment into pages and within each page are 1-2 ""beats"" (An action and reaction), each page is delineated>Whole chapter story boards or thumbnails (to get high level composition down)>Then just produce each page of the chapter. \nTo keep reader interest you need to have a beat of action in a page. That is have someone do or say something, and it gets a reaction from the world around them. \nAnd for long stories you really have to do a lot of front end work to get long term success. In the end though as a hobby, the only goal is to finish it. \nI do webcomics for a living, which explains my pace, but I see hobbies as the sort of thing you do for its own sake, not for some result or reaction from the outside world. \nHaving posted a single \'page\' (I reformat to scrolling for Tapas), three times a week since January, I have seen steady growth because readers like consistency and its our responsibility to craft a reading habit in the audience with regular updates. Reliability is a big thing for webcomics. \nSo updating steadily at a pace you know you can sustain is the best way to go. If that\'s a slow pace then you can expect extremely slow results. \nFor storytelling I have a couple resources to start but the general gist is still what I said above, Know your story, write it out, then draw. \nCause webcomics are a marathon of marathons and you get better at running one of you start with smaller projects and finish them. Mini marathons before you try for a really long and hard one. I made a pair of 50 page one shot stories before I even considered attempting a really long story. Finishing projects boosts confidence like nothing else. \nResources: Look up all you can about the three act structure. Start there. What structure applies to the whole comic can apply to a single act, single chapter, and even a single page sometimes. \nBooks on Screenwriting help with comics cause they\'re not quite novels or plays or even film but film is the best place to start to write tight stories because comics require a lot of time and effort for drawing and its best that time is used precisely and effectively so you don\'t have to go backs and change things when you\'re already on the middle of a story.', 'Thank you a lot for your advices. I think you’re right. It’s harsh to hear because I can’t see how to apply your advices without just starting a new comics and let this one where it was. I can totally take a break with this one, make a short story and come back later, but if you think the story telling is just too confusing, I don’t know how to improve this one without starting over from the beginning. \nThere’s three arc, three world, and each chapter was going to be a part of one arc. Chapter 1 in world 1, Chapter 2 in world 2, Chapter 3 in world 3, then chapter 4 back in world 1, if you know what I mean. I guess this work for a novel, not for a comics. Do you think I can save this anyway? Or there’s really no solution for this one?', ""If you're really attached to your comic, starting over isn't necessarily a bad thing. A lot of webcomics end up getting rewritten and remade even after dozens of chapters are out (examples from Webtoon include Love n Life, and Roy and Sawaii. The super popular Everwake is also a remake). It's a lot of work, but you're still pretty early in your story. \nThe chapter format for my comic is actually pretty similar to yours. Each chapter focuses on a different set of characters in different locations until they eventually all meet up. I spent who knows how long working with my beta readers to make sure the transitions between chapters wasn't confusing. And it still sort of is. I'm still fine tuning the transition between chapters 1 and 2 six weeks after I finished making chapter 1. I think it can work well in a comic format, but it'll just require a lot more work than in a novel. Seems we both made our lives difficult for ourselves \nI agree that the art style changes are very confusing. I would suggest going on a hiatus and finding a style that suits you before continuing. Changes in art throughout the course of your story due to growth and improvement is normal. Complete changes in style are not. You should have some form of continuity between chapters. Going from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 was really confusing because there was no lead in, a different art style, a different format, and different characters. There's nothing to suggest that it's the same comic.\nAs for the actual format, is there a reason why you changed from traditional to vertical/scrolling?\nI think the comic is salvageable, but it'll probably need to be reworked a bit and remade if you want to address all the comments so far."", ""I can tell you i was in the same spot. Last summer, I started old version of my comic and stopped in autumn. To make it short, it was bad. People were coming very slowly, the art was ugly and it was overall mess. I didn't understand back then, I thought my art was great, so why didn't people like it? I stopped, because I felt it's not right and decided to reboot the whole thing.I spent months remaking the comic, making the story better, working on my art and figuring out the structure of the story. When I look at it now, I fully understand why it didn't take off. It was confusing and I'm sure readers didn't have no clue what is going on. The art was bad, same with the formatting. When you decide to stop and start over, you do yourself a favor. Yes, it sucks and hurts a lot, but it's for the betterIt also takes a lot of time and effort, but sometimes you just need to sit down and think about your stories. \nI launched the new version of that comic on July 23rd and I much happier now. I hope you can go through the same process and be happier. If you want to, you can compare my old and new comic and judge for yourself if there is an improvement.\nOld\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nBETA VERSION - NO LONGER UPDATED - Synastry | Tapas\nTHIS WAS A BETA VERSION, IT'S NO LONGER UPDATED AND CANON, CHECK THE ACTUAL COMIC:\n\nhttps://tapas.io/series/SYNASTRY/info\n\nWelcome to the world of Synastry, a fantastic place where your zodiac sign gives you the power of elements, the ability to...\n\n\n\n\n\nNew\n\ntapas.io4\n\n\n\nSYNASTRY | Tapas\nCharlie and Epsilon are two kids who live on their own.

So many stories may be long, confusing or already told, but people will come back to see a character they love deal with the situation. (Seriously, how many ""oblivious young boy turns out to be chosen one who will save all humanity"" stories are out there. We do love a trope!) But this does mean you have to really invest in creating interesting characters and spending time showing their emotions as they fight and persevere through the plot. Spend a lot of time figuring out how each character talks, walks, emotes. \nI would only change art styles for major changes in the story. Like flashbacks or something. And no changes that feel particularly jarring, just enough to cue the reader that it\'s a break in the normal flow of the story. \nI spent a lot of time trying to give my (rather large) cast unique personalities without just coming out and saying ""this is the cutesy but shy one!"" if you want to see how I did it. \n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nprodigium | Tapas\nAfter several people wake up in the hospital with no memory everything just seems ""wrong"".

Your dialogue Is super basic and doesn’t really much to what we are already seeing in the pictures. I think a rewrite to a lot of the dialogue would draw more people in.\nI think the art looks nice and reminds me of picture book illustrations. In some way it might make sense to have more descriptive dialogue like that in a picture book.', 'Thank you a lot for all your answers. I was definitely fooling myself with this comics, I put lot and lot of emotions in it, it’s a story I want to tell since a really long time, but I’m just not ready to do anything good about it. And starting comics with a 100 year long story was clearly not a good idea, especially without a clear art style or efficient story telling skill. \nI came to the conclusion to take a break on this one, I’ll not learn a lot by continuing this. I will take time to practice my art, practice on shorter comics, comedy strip (my other comic here), and redo this project later, posting it only when I have a full chapter to show. \nNow I’m really embarrassed to have posted here as it was clearly confusing and bad, but you helped me realise everything wrong about it and what to do next, thank you ', ""Don't be ashamed, if you didn't post it, you wouldn't learn anything  Now you did and can get better "", 'Hi! \nI’m posting here again, a few month after I made this post, just to tell you I learned from my mistakes. Last time I read your answers, I realised how much I needed to learn and progress in order to make proper webcomic. So, I deleted the first one, and here’s my new one. I think I improved a lot with the art style at least, and if I still need to improve my writing skills on this lot much simpler story, I finally started to learn the good way.

243,Which genre do you think my comic fits into best?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'm working on this cute little comic called ""How to Save a Princess"" and I'm not sure which genre it will go in though. It's supposed to be simple (a way simplified style). I was starting with a much bigger project but I've never done comics before so I thought it was best to dip my toes in with something I can make fast and easy to kind of get the hang of it and get some experience before trying a big project.
The premise: Prince Francis and Princess Rosella are in love, but her father's insists Prince Francis must prove his worth in a traditional fairy tale scenario if he wants to marry her. The only problem? Princess Rosella doesn't know, and she's not the type to sit around and wait for a prince to rescue her. 
It's supposed to be cute, funny, kooky, and sweet. I talked to some friends and they were thinking comedy/fantasy? 
This will be my first comic ever so I also attached the first strip I made  (I'd like to get a few more done before I upload so I thought it was a good time to ask questions about things like 'Which genre?' and I have to get some things like the cover and an icon done) 
The next strip will be the King and Prince Francis discussing how Prince Francis must prove his worth if he wants to marry the Princess, and the King promising to set up a scenario for this.Then it's going to hop right into the adventure. With Princess Rosella playing the part of Rapunzel, trapped in a tower. And she is just super bored and really misses Francis. So while he's searching for her, she'll be plotting her escape. And continue with Francis trying to save Rosella from various situations that she manages to handle herself with ease.
If you have any thoughts or tips besides the genre for the Newbie here I'd love to hear them!

244,Finished up writing a comic and I wouldn’t mind some feedback on the pages done so far,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Now of course there is a quick rundown of what my comic ""Happy Pines18"" is about. The story is set on a remote campground located in Nova Scotia Canada where a few weeks ago a group of campers went missing during the night while they went to explore the nearby caverns. All the bodies were found chewed up by some kind of animal except for one which is still missing. The camp has just officially reopened and we follow one of the employees, Ash, as she slowly begins to uncover what truly happened to the body that was never recovered.","[""I looked through your pages and I have some feedback. I hope it's ok with some constructive things.\nYour obviously good at drawing and I think the premise seem interesting. There are a couple of things I think can be improved when you go forward.\nDialogue & speech bubbles: There's a lot of dialogue, I think some of it can be removed. Dialogue in a comic/movie doesn't have to be super realistic, it's better to only keep the parts that are relevant to the story. When there's a lot of dialogue, you can separate the speach bubbles into smaller chunks for better readability.\nBackgrounds/perspective: I like that there's a lot of backgrounds in the comic, you can tell where the characters are without being confused (I can be lazy when it comes to backgrounds...). I like the outsdoors panels, but think that the perspective can be improved, especially when the characters are inside (for example at the reception scene). It's nice with a colored comic, but the coloring has white spots in some places, like everything hasn't been filled in.\nGood luck with your comic "", 'Good job on the comic!And congrats to uploading the comic.It´s always good when somebody is asking for feedback.There are some things which I see which I also have problems with myself.\nOne small thing which can easily be fixed, the speech in the speech bubbles isoften too close to the bubble´s border. It would look more professional when the text is centered more with more space in the bubble\nNumber one is perspective. You are on a good way but it looks like you need to put more timeinto it or plan the perspective of the scenes better. \nNumber two is the style, the characters look the best in the dialogue they are having inthe car. I see a change of style and also quality in the other panels. There are somepanels where it looks like you put more effort in like the other panels. Like the last panelin the car. I would go with one style, which maybe can be a little bit more simple for the start but one style you are able to draw the whole comic in', ""Always happy to look at more Canadian Content!\nI'm not an illustrator, so I don't have a ton of comments about the art, but I wouldn't recommend background details that look like they were hastily completed in MS paint (like the road signs in Ep.2). The character acting is okay, which is a good sign, and the hook is promising. It's clear from the art that you're developing, and there's enough promise that I want to see how you level up.\nAs for the dialogue and speech balloons, your hand-drawn balloons really took me out of it. \nFrankly, they look sloppy - enough so that it made me not want to read more. Not saying you NEED pro software like illustrator, but please do check out a professional guide like this one to get yourself started in learning how to do standard speech balloons. That change alone would vastly improve your story's readability: (http://clintflickerlettering.blogspot.com/2010/10/lettering-in-adobe-illustrator-one.html) \nFor an unambiguously positive thought, remember that the first step to improving in any skill is to DO SOMETHING.

248,Thoughts on my webcomic series’ season 2 so far? Seeking opinions,Reviews | Feedback,[],"In the comments of the latest episode, I had a conversation with a fellow reader and there they open up about their perception of one of the main characters, R. No one else has pointed this out but them.
They say that her character is controlling and pushes herself into everyone's problems, which wasn't my intention. I know she has flaws and I won't defend that, but I was wondering if any of y'all share a similar mindset as the reader on how she is portrayed in the 2nd season.
Season 2 starts here15","['Overall, I thought this season was a lot stronger than the first! You\'ve addressed a lot of the criticisms I brought up in my review thread and really gone in for it with a continuous story and addressing the harder emotional issues rather than shying away from them to focus on fluff. The discussion of depression was sensitive and real, and I liked that the stigma of men struggling with mental health issues and macho culture encouraging them to shrug it all off instead of seeking help was addressed.\nAs for R... well, she\'s flawed, but I personally wouldn\'t call her ""toxic"". Yes, she comes across as an emotionally needy person, BUT she\'s being nosy with a person who actually really needs that, because everyone else is encouraging him to change who he is and push down his pain in order to be accepted, and R comes along and quite forcefully keeps asserting that she accepts and loves him. Is it for slightly selfish reasons because she also needs validation and attention and love? Quite possibly, but that\'s just human and it\'s clear that she is investing effort in a guy who really, really needs it right now.Having a lot of friends with depression, I\'ve found that you do need to go and seek them out and check up on them and push them a bit to socialise and stuff because they do need it and often self-sabotage and try to destroy or not maintain relationships as a defence. They\'re generally pretty thankful in the long run if you don\'t let them run and burn all their bridges or fade away. Sometimes you have to chase friends with depression, and sometimes the people who will chase them are a bit needy themselves, but maybe that\'s not completely bad?', 'I do agree with your sentiments too. There is still more to her that needs to be discussed in future episodes.\nI understood that expressing how much you care about that person who needs the love too may be her way of loving, but it can definitely be misinterpreted by a few people. \nLooking forward on getting the other episodes out and thank you so much for the reply ', ""Omg, I've had another reader who was so passionate about the latest episode:\n\n(A comment from the FB page btw)\nI do feel they are defending the main character here but wow that anger :V"", ""That's awesome!

My thought is that half of the book will be set in the past and the other in the present. Do you think I should go back and forth between past and present or talk about each all at once. It is first person point of view. I will talk about other people in my story but briefly. Do you think this will be detrimental to my story. This is not a memoir. Since this is about my life some episodes will be episodic but some will be linear (ish). A lot of people want a linear story but my life is not like that, it is all over the place.
In this book, the reason why I thought to put it as science fiction is because the individual does not know about anything in the beginning and then all of a sudden her life changes in a matter of several years. She was introduced to new technology, new ideas. Should this be science fiction or slice of life?

That might not be what your character does, though. But it\'s also acceptable to call stories scifi if they only use a future or alternative universe as a setting for a love story, for example.Tag it both, if the fit at all or you think readers will think they fit.

250,Looking for Feedback on my story hook,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So I've been working on a fantasy story and I just want to make sure the hook actually...hooks. Because webcomics tend to move...and I have the bad habit of slowing down. It's also in vertical format and I'm used to horizontal so I just feel like double checking that it's working...So I'm gonna link to the first 4 episodes (it's 4 even though it says more than that--it's just that Tapas episodes can't fit as many as webtoon so I had to halve it. It doesn't take too long to read though. There's some dialogue but it's not very dense.) the feedback I'm looking for is.
-would you keep reading? why or why not? (this is mostly preference, if you're into the genre or the age group, but I still want this feedback)-do you understand what is happening?-what was the thing that pulled you in the most?-for reals, did I misspell anything?
The story is intended for the phone so those on monitors will get that lovely thing where it's just like...huge ass bubbles and space everywhere.
As for art (especially the anatomy), I already know that Meredith contains multitudes and will not stay on model for her dear life--I'm not too worried about that since I'm gonna go back and fix that eventually after I've gotten used to drawing her. This isn't 100% finalized or polished, which is why I'm showing it to you now. Especially Ep 1 is a little jank, and it will see some polishing done at a later time, it was just the first episode so I wasn't solid yet on what stylistic routes I was taking. (that and I wanted Ep 1 to be kind of dreamlike)

This isn't ironic or anything, it's literally just a test and hopefully Tapas won't notify people I've made it. Hopefully. Just don't sub to this one OK? There ain't nothing here.

Again I know this sounds deepy ironic but it's super not. I'll be...





I will be deleting it once I get enough feedback, since it is like months of uploads. The lucky few get to see it early, ooo.","['So I think, in regards to working in a vertical scrolling format, this is very successful. You\'ve got some great pacing with really tightly-packed fast-moving chaotic action sequences combined with some really serene slow-paced bits, and a nice way of building tension with the physical scrolling. So in that respect, mad props.\nAs for your spelling, the one thing that stood out is that it\'s Dante\'s Inferno, with Dante being possessive, while you\'ve got it spelled Dantes Inferno, like Dante is plural.\nThe only thing that really confused me as a reader is how the female character knew that the place she landed in was a place called Dante\'s Inferno, because nothing let the reader know how she knew. Has she been there before, and that\'s how she knew? Has she just heard about it spoken of? Even including a line of dialogue like, ""Not this place again... I\'ve been here before! Dante\'s Inferno!"" Or, ""I\'ve heard about this place... Please don\'t let it be what I think it is! Dante\'s Inferno!"" That will give the reader a little more information so it\'s not as confusing. \nIt\'s also a little hard right off the bat to see how Meredith\'s story has anything to do with the hybrid\'s story, or vice versa. The portal goes to Earth (?) But Meredith isn\'t on Earth anymore? She\'s in Dante\'s Inferno, but hybrid man is in a place called Chiaroscuro. And I\'m currently far more interested in what happened to Meredith, rather than broody pretty boy\'s contemplations of life, so as a reader, if I didn\'t get more Meredith or very strong suggestions of how the stories might cross over sooner rather than later, I might lose interest.\nThose are just my initial thoughts, but overall I think it\'s a really great start! Honestly!', '@ninjashira thank you so much that\'s super helpful actually--I think I can put in a sign with all the other signs so that way it lets people know that this is the name of a place on Earth named after the story, especially since we have two different places. Thank you so much for the feedback! I wasn\'t sure if I should put in a ""meanwhile"" type narrator thing when going between the two places because it felt kind of corny.', 'Yeah I definitely don\'t think you need a narrator caption or anything like that, like you said, they are a little corny. And it\'s very clear that the two storylines are in different places, the art and the script speaks for itself in that regard.\nI think the confusion came from thinking that when the woman crashed and realized she was in Dante\'s Inferno, that Dante\'s Inferno isn\'t on Earth. That somehow the crash took her to another world, like Dorothy and the tornado. The sequence of art there does have a very ""transported to another dimension"" vibe to it, and of course the name ""Dante\'s Inferno"" has unavoidable correlations of a man leaving Earth and journeying through the dimensions of hell. Visually or verbally reinforcing that Dante\'s Inferno in your story is still on Earth would definitely help alleviate that initial confusion.']",1/8/2021 19:55,https://forums.tapas.io/t/looking-for-feedback-on-my-story-hook/53568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Great White Wolf's Daughter | Tapas
Norþ is a land of pine trees, mountains, and in the uppermost part of it, snow. And there is a tradition in this snowy region: to sacrifice a baby to the wulfas before every winter, in the hopes of receiving milder weather.
Fyr was one of those...





","['I had a bit of troubles with hunting scene, mostly because it was telling me something important without much back up material. By some reason, the wolf that adopted a human is dead-bent on her acting as a human. That’s something that is not intuitive, but we skip to it to killing a female (deer, I assume), the mechanics of which is not really interesting. I would suggest blending the hunt and the exploration of the past in this scene, beefing it up, making it a discussion with some cool dialogue.\nThe second part of the chapter works far better for me, because it invokes emotions, and is easier to understand. It might be more recognizable too... so, you can always start there, and set up the hunting scene as a memory when Fyr grieves for her mother later.', 'Thanks, Domi.

252,How many pages do you prefer per episode?[CLOSED],Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi everyone.
Question is, how many pages do you prefer per episode?
Thing is my newest chapters need up to 70 pages, and I end up having a chapter divided in 2 episodes (Tapas' names for the updates) of 30 or so pages.
But I fear that these 30+ pages episodes are too much for new readers, and I was thinking that it might be good to divide the chapters in episodes of 8 or 10 pages to prevent that.
I think I can add and reorder episodes without losing the views/likes I already got, correct me otherwise.
Here's an example of the pages I do from CH1 (oldest) and CH5 (latest) respectively:
imagen.png1091x711 850 KB
These are kinda like the most ""text-filled"" pages from their own chapters.
Next are the total pages per episode(+covers and so on):

37 pages (CH1)
37 pages (CH2)
40 pages (CH3)
26 pages (CH4 I)
25 pages (CH4 II)
28 pages (CH5 I)
7 pages (CH5 II)
38 pages (CH5 III)

And finally, a survey to know how many pages would you think are okay for each episode, and if so, whether I should do it for the already uploaded ones or just for the next ones I'll upload:
 8-10 pages starting from next episode
 8-10 pages for everything already uploaded
 16-20 pages starting from next episode
 16-20 pages for everything already uploaded
 32+, leave it as it is

Here's the comic if you need to see more pages to take a decision:https://tapas.io/series/The-Memorable-Bittersweet-Days/
How many pages per episode do you make?What kind of format do you prefer to use?
Thanks!
UPDATE
Thing is I'm inclining to reupload the whole series but in parts of 4 or so pages as many have proposed.I was already working on some corrections to the first three chapters to later update the Tapas episodes and start uploading to Webtoons as well. This in order to not overwhelm new readers from Tapas and Webtoons with a 37-pages Chapter 1 and as some of you said, to be more present in the fresh category.
Though panels and story will remain the same, drawings would be more consistent, typos corrected and some dialogues will be shortened and others that were redundant deleted, along with better dialogue bubbles that help for the flow of it.
Here is some comparison between Page 13 from old CH1 and new CH1:

imagen.png1064x716 764 KB

Only thing I'm not sure now is if I should delete the already uploaded episodes or to edit the 8 I have so Episodes 1-8 would be CH1 divided in parts of 4-5 pages, and then upload the new versions of the chapters during this month.
Thanks to everyone who has voted/commented so far!","[""For every chapter/episode, it's about 20 to 24 pages long. However, if chapters don't need to be that long without adding filler pages, I could finish it when it feels right."", ""With how much text occupies one page, I would recommend even less than 8 to 10 pages. Maybe 3 or 4, but even that's generous given how easily exhausted a reader might get going through all that text."", ""I second less than 8 on a story-heavy comic. Your chapters aren't too big, 4 should be fine to give a reader plenty of stopping points without making the episode list too big. I honestly get overwhelmed if a single episode makes me read half a regular comic with all the information that entails, over and over."", ""That's something I'm worrried about too.The comic will have around 30 chapters of 60 or so pages. let's say we get a total of 1800 pages, and that divided by 8 would be 225 episodes in the list, I don't know if it would be overwhelming or not by then"", ""Yeah, most of my favorite webcomics have the equivalent of about 2-4 pages per episode. It's long enough to satisfy people's need for content, but short enough to satisfy people's short attention spans. Plus it's reasonable enough to complete 2-4 pages worth of content in a weekly or every-other-week update schedule that it can update frequently as well.\nNot everyone can sit and read comics for a long time. If every episode of a comic is 20-30 pages long, and they have to stop in the middle to wrangle a kid or because their only reading time is when they're sitting on the toilet, it's a pain to try and jump back in in the middle of an episode. \nAnd if a comic is posting that many pages at once, how often is it updating? Once every other month probably? Even less frequently? Updates that infrequent tend to not build good audiences because 1) it doesn't show up on the app often enough to catch people's attention, and 2) in the two months since the previous update, a lot of people might have forgotten what happened in the previous episode. But because the previous episode is so long, they don't want to go back and reread it just to understand what's happening now. So they don't read the new stuff and lose interest."", ""Yes, it's been updating with 24-32 pages per month.Thanks on the feedback!"", ""225 may seem like a lot of episodes but there are plenty on ongoing comics that have that episode count without being close to finished, so don't worry about having shorter episodes too much."", ""Yeah like 100% of the time on Tapas, it's better to post many smaller updates than it is to post one big one, for visibility metrics if nothing else. Each time you update your comic, it can show up in the Fresh category where new readers can see it and start reading. So you could very easily manage weekly updates with shorter episodes and have a better chance of building a stronger following.\nAnd I know you expressed concern about having too many episodes and that people might get intimidated by that, but in a post on the forums just a few months ago, pretty much everyone agreed that they love discovering a new comic they love and finding out that it has a ton of episodes, because it means they can sit and binge the whole thing and really get sucked in. My comic is over 150 episodes now, and will be over 300 by the time I'm done with it, and new readers love that there's so much to binge."", ""Honestly, that'd be more on Tapas than you. It wouldn't be overwhelming for a reader from what I've seen(some comics easily reach four digits and have huge audiences!), but sometimes the episode list could start glitching out. I'd say keep it to few pages per episode, and have an external archive on ComicFury or something else so people can go back for a refresher, with pages tagged by character or anything else that's relevant."", ""I'll leave the pool for one more day and then decide."", ""I would be so overwhelmed as a reader if someone posted a 30 page update, especially that text heavy.

Back in May or June of 2019, I decided to redraw the first chapter of webcomic, The Black Belt Society. And now it is January 1st, of 2021. 
I decided to do this in between working on new pages and my personal life, thinking it wouldn't take more than a few months to do. Boy was I wrong. I chose to ignore all the good advice of, ""don't redo your first few pages. move on and work to make your newer pages even better.""

I've been working on this for so long and I would really, really appreciate some feedback on the result, mind you any further editing of this chapter will be miniscule in effect. 
(There are a few creators in the forum who I specifically want feedback from, @ItzaMeLuigi and @darthmongoose but I believe they're both busy with other reviews, but in all honesty I don't mind getting a review from anyone who's willing.)
I actually archived the first iteration of chapter one  The Black Belt Society so if you want to see how this all started and what's changed here you go: https://tapas.io/series/BBS-Issue-1-Chapter-113
But on to the main event:

The Black Belt Society | Tapas
A Goddess is missing. . .

And her three sisters have lost hope in finding her. Almost all hope. Their last resort is to call on three teens from the beloved city of Emberry. Elliot, Tyler, and Lara have the talent and bravery to find the lost...






Please check out my comic because I'm honestly very desperate for praise because of how long this has taken me. Don't redraw your first chapter kids, cuz it's probably not gonna be worth it. I mean for me it was, but you know
Thank you!","['OMG, I LOVED IT SO MUCH YOUR ARTSTYLE IS AMAZING!PD: it gives me vibes of Steven Universe, keep it up!', ""Oh Thank you! Don't Hesitate on checking out the redraw and telling me what you think!"", ""Ok after reading some of your chapters of the old and the new, I see the changes between your old work to the new, the new one has a lot more detail than the other, its like more lively than the old one ( at least to me it is), and the new version has more of a build up  than the old.\n(I stopped at where the old man appeared btw)\nSo Basically you improve a lot with your artwork and adding more scenes, to me it makes me more intrigue with the new story than the old one. (Sorry if it sounds mean, I don't intend to )\nHappy New Years\u200b"", 'Thank you and happy new years to you too!', 'Hey your re-draw looks really beautiful--and absolutely looks like it would take a year and a half to do, that is a ton of work with full color, effects, lighting, resizing everything, adding a bunch of dialogue, redrawing and repainting basically everything--congrats!  \nI remember reading it back in the day, before the repaint, and the change I\'m happiest about is you\'ve added a lot more breathing room when it comes to the plot. It still has a lot thrown at you all at once, since that\'s the genre we\'re in, and the story is so simple it doesn\'t need a lot of explanation. They\'re just hunting macguffins right now...if there\'s more depth to the lore, I assume you\'re gonna drop that in later when there\'s more time. But before the re-draw, the plot was so quick that you wouldn\'t always catch why certain things had happened in the panels before (especially in regards to action) this is much more naturally paced now. \nThat and now we have a lot more interaction between the characters--so we can grow more of a connection with them. I\'m really thankful for that, especially the hints that they have been doing adventures before this occurred. When I first read the story, I didn\'t really catch that they were such close friends. They\'re a lot closer buddies now, and have a little bit of a history, and that is a welcome change.\nIn the first iteration of this story they kinda just...waltzed into a dojo and it was very convenient. While this is still very much a ""We don\'t really need a reason, lets just have some fun"" storyline, at least they questioned it a little more. They could probably question it...more, because they immediately accept that this magic stuff is happening. But, I\'m glad to see that in the rewrite you put in hints that they are a already familiar with the lore of the goddesses and that they are used to living in a universe where magic is already a thing. It makes their quest make a lot more sense.\nI think the shiny effects and the polish is really nice--there are some places where there was so much going on that my eyes didn\'t know what to focus on--it\'s a lot of sharp edges with not a whole lot of round and organic shapes to balance it out so just be mindful that it\'s easy to lose the shapes. That is the style, and I do like sharp styles. ((One of my favorite artists is Tan Zhi Hui, who also goes by the pseudo name of kudaman (I\'ll just put a link here because you\'ll probably like it https://www.artstation.com/kudaman2) and he\'s a sharp artist as well. Sharp art is so great.))\nThe big thing about having such an intense style is that because it\'s not just for one illustration, and for many successive illustrations you are reading for quite a while, it can be exhausting for the eye, since it is very energetic and colorful and quite punchy if you don\'t mind my pun. So, I was very thankful for pages that balanced that out with blank space. It directed flow back to areas of interest, and it gave my eye somewhere to rest. Blank space is your friend, especially if you have a lot of energy.\nAnother thing is that sometimes I would lose the silhouette, for the reasons I mentioned before and also just because I hadn\'t gotten used to it yet. It\'s different from a normal human silhouette, so when there\'s a lot of action or a lot of lines on a page it would be a hunt of ""where\'s my human"" so just paying attention to color contrast I think will help prevent that (and you definitely got way better at keeping this from happening later in the comic and also in the parts you\'ve recently redrawn--I read all that you have up and the art improved so much I don\'t want to dog on that because...it improved. You figured it out and are getting better all the time.)\nAnd finally, again, I\'m so happy to see more character interaction, and I would love to see more of it. Especially stuff that can give them more depth. Right now they\'re still kinda basic, it is only Ch 3, but there\'s not a whole lot of ways I can relate to them. They don\'t really have any flaws or distinctive quirks, with the exception of Tyler, who\'s kind of a dumbass. It\'s not that I don\'t like them, but if I was asked to describe them I wouldn\'t really know what to say other than the powers that they use.\nOverall though--you should be very proud of this, it\'s a huuuuuge upgrade!', ""Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for taking the time to read my comic again!\nI really appreciate the praise and advice. Most all of the things you've said I agree with. \n\n\nrajillustration:\nI think the shiny effects and the polish is really nice--there are some places where there was so much going on that my eyes didn't know what to focus on--it's a lot of sharp edges with not a whole lot of round and organic shapes to balance it out so just be mindful that it's easy to lose the shapes.\nI completely agree that sometimes I have a hard time balancing the colors and effects (because I really like doing lighting effects) and the sharpness of the style. I'm so used to drawing like this that sometimes it doesn't dawn on me to take a step back and lean into the curve of a line, so I do need to work on that. And the artist you brought up has beautiful work so thanks for introducing them to me.\n\n\nrajillustration:\nEspecially stuff that can give them more depth. Right now they're still kinda basic, it is only Ch 3, but there's not a whole lot of ways I can relate to them.\nThank you! One of the big critiques I got for chapter one was poor characterization and a lack of interaction between them, so I'm glad I was able to write this part better for the redraw. Things do get more interesting in the future and hopefully their personalities will be better communicated.\n\n\nrajillustration:\nwith the exception of Tyler, who's kind of a dumbass.\n Believe me Tyler's a smart guy, he just . . .  he just really sucks at showing it.

","[""I think from a readability standpoint, you have definitely improved! The cleaner lineart and bigger font are great for mobile reading, and it's very easy to read your dialogue and tell what order you're supposed to read your panels and balloons in, which is the most important thing.\nIf you want little areas of improvement, I would suggest moving your speech bubbles further outside the border of your panels. You have a lot of empty white space around all of your panels, but your speech bubbles are often times crammed right on top of your art and your characters. One of the greatest benefits of a vertical scrolling comic is you can move your speech bubbles completely off your panel art, exposing more artwork.\nSeparate from legibility, since you pretty much have that in the bag now, the thing I would urge you to consider improving in the future is varying your camera shots. You have a lot of straight-on mid-range camera shots, which can be a little monotonous on the eye, especially during an action scene. Try to include a variety of close-up shots, longer distance shots, wide environmental shots, and shots that don't necessarily have a character's face in it (like a shot of a hand closing into a fist, or a foot trying to get traction on the ground). That will definitely bump your comic up to the next level.\nBut for readability and legibility, you nailed it!"", 'Thanks a lot Ninja,\nGave a lot of in depth critiques I can go on, will definitely take to account for following episodes especially ones with action scenes.\nAnd yeah really wanted to make the comic neater and flow better for mobile, glad that’s coming across']",1/1/2021 10:08,https://forums.tapas.io/t/critiques-of-recent-episode/53255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you want to focus on it, focus on it, but do not just throw it as a subclause in the middle of everything else. In other words, after you said that her eyes deadened, start a new sentence and dedicate a full paragraph to the description of her bewitching eyes.\nTHEN start a new paragraph and let your protagonist REACT to that dead gaze, experience it, emotionally follow up to it.\n You also overexplain with ""what she did was confusing""--it is better not to say that, it is better to write a paragraph which shows the protagonist\'s confision through inner thoughts or emotional reactions.\nSo, overall, try to break up your text in simpler senetnces with correct grammatical constructions and separate what is happening (Mother looks at the character, mother reaches out to smother them) from emotional feed from the character and clearly deliver that conventional feed between the actions.', 'I think the main thing that\'s making this feel off is that you need dialogue.\nthe eyes that she has been of a deep brown, that\'s always mistaken of black\nShould probably be the MC telling her this.

260,Being recommended to un-mature my series?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Heya, I've been keeping up with my satirical anime story ""Magical Heroines?!"" for a year now and kept it marked ""Mature"" due to some implied sexual content, a lil ultraviolence here and there, and a few villains who are just straight-up anime lolicon pedophiles as part of me complaining about fandom through my work... But I have a friend who has suggested multiple times that I should take off the mature tag so as to increase visibility on the mobile app and so on.

Luminary: Agent of the Dawn | Tapas
A young human woman sets out on a quest to find powers that might save the life of her friend.





","[""Okay so! First of all, I think your character art is really good. I like the designs, and you're already really great at varying your camera angles, and you have a solid grasp of a lot of basic comic book logic that makes reading your comic nice and easy.\nI definitely don't think you should drop your comic if you still enjoy drawing it, and you want to tell the story. I think there are a few things you can improve on, if that's something you wanted to do (which I'm going to assume since your title mentioned review and feedback).\nSo right off the bat, the number one thing you can do to improve the quality of your comic is to polish up your text. Please please please do not use Comic Sans. At this point, that font is a joke in and of itself, and there is definitely a large audience of readers who will refuse to read your comic purely because the dialogue is in Comic Sans. Instead, go to Blambot and get yourself a free comic lettering font (some fonts you have to pay for, but there are free ones on there), and promise to never use Comic Sans for anything ever again.\nThe other thing, related to the dialogue, are the speech bubbles themselves. The long hoagie-style speech balloons like this...\n\nimage.png892x462 55.8 KB\n\n...are difficult to read. It will be a lot easier for your audience to read all that dialogue if you break it up across smaller, rounder balloons. People don't read a word at a time, they read in chunks, and if you give them smaller chunks, they can read easier and faster. So if you aim for balloons like this...\n\nimage.png823x484 634 KB\n\n...which are smaller and more rounded, with the text inside making that nice diamond shape...\n\nimage.png617x746 12.9 KB\n\n...it will be easier to get through large sections of text.\nThe other thing I would suggest to help you out it.... make your episodes shorter. Your episodes are long, which is great, because people love a lot of content... but people also have short attention spans. You could very, very, very reasonably make break each of your episodes into two or even three episodes and still have enough content to make your readers happy each episode. Then you could either update more frequently (which is good for visibility metrics) or stay ahead of your updates to build up a buffer (which will make your life so much easier).\nFinally, you may be aware of this already, but your backgrounds need some work. They are very sparse. You're pretty good at giving us an establishing shot, so we know where we are, but then every panel after that will either have a completely white background, or maybe one little line to indicate where the floor meets the wall. Adding more character, detail, and tone to your backgrounds will really ground your characters in the space, so they feel like they actually exist in some kind of physical plane, rather than floating in an endless white void. And, on the subject of your backgrounds, you have this habit of airbrushing around your characters...\n\nimage.png435x688 129 KB\n\n...which makes them feel like they aren't a part of the environment they're occupying. I understand why you do it, because you're trying to separate the characters from the background so they don't get lost in all the lineart, but it's not achieving the effect you are going for. A better tactic might be to use a thinner line weight for your background elements if you really need that separation... But mostly you need to trust your art and let your characters exist in the environment. Which means their lines will touch the background lines. \nI think if you do those things, you'll have a really solid comic on your hands, and I think you should definitely continue to work on it if that's something you want to do. Don't let numbers or subscriber growth or anything get to you right away, you only have three episodes out, and it can take a long time for a new comic to pick up traction.

262,I finished Chapter Two in time for the New Year! Feedback appreciated < 3,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I just finished posting chapter two of my comic. I've been working on it for about 2 years now! I do have some specific questions for readers of chapter two so that hopefully, I can go back and correct things at a later stage. My main questions are these:

during the flashblack scenes, it is clear that what is being shown is reality while hugh is telling a fictionalized version? otherwise how can i make that more clear? is there another way to show that hugh is essentially censoring the story for a kid without censoring it for the readers? would it help if i redacted the swear words with black bars?
what are your first impressions of the female character in demin?
what are your feelings about the relationship between hugh and zauna?

Please feel free to be as detailed as possible. I'd really appreciate criticism, however harsh!

15 years ago, a fighting game was released called Ignis Somnia. There is a massive competitive scene around this game, because of that its history is filled with drama and dark secrets. Now, an ordinary young man named Nine goes on to have a fateful...





","[""Yeah your comic is quite cool! The dialogue felt like it was fast paced in a good way, definitely felt pulled along with Nine into this crazy world.

I'm thinking of some fantasy isekai that I read that focused on unusual heroes and this seems similar but might not be as relevant to the fantasy crowd. Just a guess though?\nI like your character art and the backgrounds get the point across. I think some readers might want more polish in order to follow but obviously there's a balance between getting story out and spending more time on panels.

264,Reformatting comic for mobile?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello! I've been thinking about going back and altering formatting for parts of my comic, and I wanted to get advice.
I do a comic called Soliloquy, which alternates between various comic and visual novel-inspired presentation styles. I like this format and I think it's really fun, but I'm having second thoughts about how I've chosen to present the traditional comic pages.
Comic pages like this5 make up the bulk of my updates. I chose to orient them horizontally, and on my website1, everything is presented with these image sliders that I think work really well with the more visual novel-y formating I use in other sequences. (Example of that if you're curious.1)
But I'm thinking about going back and reformatting the comic pages so they'll be in a longer scrolling format, and thus bigger and more mobile-friendly. I'd also go back and increase text size on my other page styles.
I have a few hesitations about this. First... I really like my paneling hahah. I'm worried that spacing things out vertically will make my layouts look worse. Secondly, it's going to take a long time to fix, and I'd have to take a hiatus to reformat old pages. I worry that I'm overthinking it, because my friends have said that they like my current format, and I shouldn't secondguess it. To be honest, I tend to struggle with perfectionism, and I'm unsure whether my current concerns are valid or just an excuse to worry.
So I wanted advice!! Has anyone here ever reformatted their comic this way after starting? Do you think it helped with readability, and do you think mine would benefit? Do you think the present formatting is difficult to read? Alternately, would anyone prefer the way it is currently...?
Thanks in advance!!","[""It's worth a shot, but in the end, it's up to you!\nI went through the effort a while back to reformat old pages, and it took several hours per episode--and in the end it wasn't worth it to me because my paneling was what sold my comic in the first place (I was doing a really simplified comic with very thin linework, and so increasing the size of panels was...hell, I'd have to redraw everything), so what I did was just...end the comic I was doing and do a new one that would be in the scroll format from the beginning. \nBut I know other people who've planned to do multiple formats, so they keep really high quality files of all their panels so they can reformat easier. I do think you lose something in the panelling, that can't be avoided--that and a lot of long format is effective because of tall panels with a lot of physical space, so you may need to redraw some panels to immerse your reader--but that all depends on how much time you put into it.\nSo it's up to you, but if you have a ton of content--then it may be best to leave it as it is, and just continue from where you are in the format you want for the future. Webcomics are pretty fluid, and especially if you have an older comic, people are pretty understanding about page format. It hurts it's chances of being on front page and does mean that a lot of people won't or can't read it, but like...you have to decide on your own after testing it out if the ends justify the means, since it will take a really long time, depending on how many pages you're doing. For me, personally--I didn't see a rise in viewership really after I tested it out since my comic was already so small...so that was part of my reason to just...let it go and move on."", ""ahh thank you for the feedback!! I luckily do have all of my original images saved at a larger scale, so editing them would definitely be time consuming but I wouldn't be forced to redraw too terribly much...

266,Can anyone review this chapter before i publish it?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So this is actually my first scene where I write an action scene and im actually pretty nervous if things doesn't make sense, so can i ask for help if this chapter does go well. So, here you go:I appreciate your kindness

Pieire and Uitare searched around the mountain looking for horses to ride on. But unfortunately, they haven't caught a glimpse of any horses yet at all, but still, their plan was after the training they will go to the kingdom's capital and know the current situation. Moreover, that's one reason they should continue looking. Pieire Courtenay's [POV]Jumping through the branches of trees, I would glance left and right every time I'd hop onto a tree hoping to find a horse. But what I saw wasn't a horse nor a demon beast. It was a group of people walking in distance.The moment I saw them I hid behind the tree, avoiding being caught, for it is risky approaching them without knowing their identity, I would peep at them and observe their movements.They carried swords and different kinds of equipment, 12 of them in total. They were on guard as they were pointing their swords and look at their surroundings as if they are alert to something. But of course, who wouldn't? This is the deep part of the mountain, a demon beast could appear at any moment.‘Is it adventurers hunting for demon beast?’ My curiosity almost made me appear in front of them and expose myself, however, things couldn't get troublesome than before.Just when I was about to reveal myself, my nose smelled something from their blades, although the distance was far, I can still smell it. During my training not only my mana and affinity were trained, Uitare trained me on how to use my senses sharper than any average human.Right now, my sense of smell is triggered by the odor coming from the blade of their swords. No, not only that but from their clothes that were stained with blood also. I never expected that they're still here... The followers of the Inheritor who set my village on bloodbath. Filthy creatures, who reeks of blood, are they still looking for me?Unimportant follower's [POV]“Ugh, ” I let out an exaggerated sigh. “If that child didn't run, we wouldn't be here in the first place.”Surely, that ""child"" he referred was Pieire 6 months ago when they slaughtered Pieire's village. But for 6 months, they remained here?“You shouldn't be saying that,” my comrade said from behind as I turned against him. “This is our lord's orders. For the sake of peace, we will risk our lives.”Pieire who was secretly spying on them was frowned by confusion, looking for answers as he questions himself.Pieire Courtenay's [POV]‘For the sake of peace?’ I questioned myself, but nothing rang the bell.I sneaked over by the bushes hoping to hear their conversation to assure what was being discussed. Even my senses have limits.The bush rustled as Pieire began to crouchThe group of followers shifted their eyes where the rustling sound came from, making them consciously aware of their surroundings. They thought they were being ambushed by a group of demon beasts for they are in the deep part of the mountain.“Who's there?!” He screechingly cried as his shoulders tightened.Silence responded instead in Pierre's stead, the insignificant follower mustered up his courage to come closer to the bush where Pieire was hiding.He walked foot by foot, his hands were claiming as he got nearer while the other followers on his back, stayed on guard.Other follower's [POV]Just as my comrade reached out his hands to the bush, a sharp clang passed by his neck, contrary to what I expected, their swords seemed to clash at each other, however, it was too fast for my naked eye to notice...That my comrade's head fell off the ground and rolled into our as his blood spilled on his neck.We turned around to call for help as soon as we saw his head rolled.Our faces turned ashen as our lips trembled, we could've run but suddenly, I felt like the air has run out, I couldn't breathe and it was as if a huge boulder was crushing us making our knees tremble that we remained frozen.What's this?I-I'm terrified... Who in the world did we make mad that's giving off a thick aura of bloodlust?The cold sweat dripped in my chin as I Slowly turned around on the bush where the source of this bloodthirst was coming from, and looking at it makes me want to regret my decision to my life. It was too terrifying. The dark aura that seemed to be bursting out of the bush, it must be my hallucination but I was sure that the dark aura was raging and it felt alive.“Forget it, I'll just finish all of you instead.” Someone came out of the bush, but what I expected was an Inheritor around age 30's, because only an expert on a battlefield can give off such killing intent. But it was just ""another"" child. We have been killing children village by village, how can I be afraid of a single child?Seeing a child who popped out of the bush made me relief for a moment, I thought I was gonna lose my life for a second back there.‘Phew...’ I wiped my set from my brows as I relaxed my shoulders.“Watch out!” Yelled by a comrade from behind.“Keuaaahk!!”A stingy pain went right into my stomach making my consciousness fade.Never did he know he was thrust by Pieire with his longsword from a distance.“Who's next?” Pieire looked back at the other followers with his menacing gaze as the dark aura bursts out of him.","['oh, spaces were ruined now its confusing\u200b']",12/24/2020 12:32,https://forums.tapas.io/t/can-anyone-review-this-chapter-before-i-publish-it/52985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been planning on opening a Ko-fi to earn some money of my own and invest in social media/equipment later; however I'm kind of an amateur and I'm still hesitant on what could I offer that fits for my style and level so far.
So I would like to know what kind of stuff would people like from someone like me via Ko-fi, or what would stop someone from being a supporter other than economical problems stuff (let's say, drawing could be improved, colors, poses, etc).
These are some drawings/pages I've made recently, so most of the stuff I do would be close to this art style:

Things that some friends and I were thinking that WOULD DO would be:

FanArt
OC requests
My OC drawings
Teases of whole pages before the actual upload (not the whole comic, but 2 or 4 pages)
Stickers
Exclusive short comics

And stuff that I WOULDN'T do (at least not as Talking_Chalk) would be:

NSFW (sex stuff, gore, etc)
Furry (to some degree, because I have cartoon-ish talking animals, but all in all, most furry-like stuff is quite uncomfortable for me to do)

And that I would NEVER do:

Political stuff
Drawings that attempt to someone's integrity

So I'd like to know what stuff, if you had the money (min $1 max $5 for starters) to pay for, would you like from Talking_Chalk:

Last month I started posting on Tapas, uploading the first 9 chapters, and despite a decent number of people reading at least the first chapter nobody is subscribing.I've been wondering if it was wise to start posting the series; if I wasn't good enough to start it then.
Should I start over? Redo the last year and a half of work?I mean, if nobody is reading, then I'm clearly doing something wrong.
I don't want to throw out my work on a whim, much less invalidate the volumes I've already published on Amazon,so I'm looking for feedback.
Please, I have to know what I'm doing wrong,and if this series is even salvageable in its current state.
Am I just marketing to the wrong people?I genuinely don't know.
Any and all feedback is welcome,and if you post your own series below, I'll gladly give my opinions on it.

It doesn't really draw me in, and does not give enough context towards the story you're creating. \nThe art, I find detailed, but a bit outdated? It's not bad, but it reminds me of Dragon Ball Z and that was created in the 80s-90s. In other words, the art may not appeal to the current mass. I mean you don't have to change it, after all ONE who wrote ONE-PUNCH MAN did not have the best drawing ability, but was still able to convey the actions through his drawing. For his comic not too many people are speaking at the same time maybe one or two people on the same panel, for yours there are a lot of people speaking, you even have the enemies speaking on the same panel as your main characters. You should try to avoid small talk and only say the most important things.\nTowards your thumbnail, it's really hard to make out the title of your comic, maybe you can add a bit of shading? Or make have a metallic shine to make it stand out?\nI believe there's too much going on in your comic; it jumps from scene to scene without leading into any proper transitions. There's too many enemies with personalities that are not fleshed out. It feels as though they were created just to be cannon fodder for your main characters—a throwaway character. Is there a main big boss they should be worried about? \nMaybe remove the 15+ age on your synopsis and add that into the beginning of your first chapter. I mean theres not much of a point, we've all seen DRAGON BALL Z at some point in our lives? Rorouni Kenshin? Inuyasha? Demon Slayer...etc.\nWish you and your comic future luck "", 'Thanks for the advice.\nBut should I start over, or work from where I’m at?', ""Starting over doesn't guarantee success. This is a difficult question, but if it were me, I would continue on with my comic, and try some new tricks here and there. \nOr you could create a trial comic that only needs 5-10 or so chapters—not wasting your hardwork or effort, something small to try and see what people are interested in, if it gains more viewers you can continue it.\nBy continuing it, I mean creating a full blown series, you can even use the same concept you're doing right now."", 'All right, let\'s see what we can do here...\nThere are a bunch of factors at play in why people might not be picking this up. Some of them are easier to do something about than others, so I\'ll just list them all and possible solutions.\n\nAction is one of the harder categories to build a following in on Tapas. Most of the audience here are primarily into more Romantic, Slice-of-Life type content, so by choosing Action, you\'re already going to be hit with a double standard. As a fellow Action comic creator on this platform, all I can say is, firstly, don\'t compare your sub numbers with people in genres like Fantasy, BL or Romance and feel bad; it\'s natural that you\'ll have fewer readers for a comic of comparable quality, and second, be sure to plug the crap out of your comic on the forums, social media etc. The good thing about Action is that because it\'s a smaller genre with lower readership, you need comparatively few likes to start climbing up those ""Popular"" rankings, and the audience aren\'t spoiled for choice so much are more saturated categories.As an extra note, I do definitely think a comic this can build an audience here with some effort, because the style, influences and tone aren\'t so far from my own comic, which has had a staff pick and is over 700 subs.\nBlack and White makes it harder to build an audience than colour. Simply switching to colour would probably increase the number of people who pick up the comic because it\'s easier to make it look polished and finished, tends to make the art more readable, is more comfortable for light-sensitive readers and is more eyecatching.\nYour cover has a pretty cool shounen manga layout, but the white background isn\'t quite working with the characters because their designs have so much white on them and rather fine outlines. I can see what you\'re going for, like the covers of Bleach and Naruto, which feature the characters in dynamic poses on a clean white BG, but try this one simple change: Make the background something other than white, maybe like orange (because it\'s a colour not present on the character designs) so we can see those wings really pop and read the dynamic silhouettes of the characters. \nThe series logotype is a bit unpolished looking with the inconsistent line weight and the weird ketchup and mustard colour combo. It\'s not an awful design, but it\'d probably look better if you redrew it with more consistent line weight, maybe tried making it gold and silver and added a little bevel on there for a metallic look, something like that. A professional looking cover is really important on Tapas because you\'re competing with pros for eyeballs.\nThe page layouts and pacing improve later, but the beginning feels a bit rushed and crammed in. There\'s this flashback opening, which doesn\'t even get the equivalent of a full page, then there\'s this... almost-cover thing like a banner, then it goes immediately into the gorilla guy without an establishing shot or space to breathe.Rather than redoing the entire comic, I\'d suggest one simple change: Spread out that flashback opening a little more, so it\'s got more breathing room, and add a bit of padding between that, the cover/banner thing and the start of the story proper. It\'ll just make the comic feel so much smoother and less confusing for new readers.\n\nOverall, I\'d say that while the art has improved, I don\'t know if I\'d advise starting over. Maybe at most, sprucing up the panelling on the earliest pages might be enough.', ""The resume looks interesting but the drawing style doesn't seem to fit, specially if its a 15+ story.\nEdit: I agree with Darthmongoose, my webcomic is action too and it grows really slowly (about 2 followers per month).Here it is, is you want to check:\n\ntapas.io4\n\n\n\nSurvivors | Tapas\nIn a post apocalyptic world where only little towns survived the SinMente plague, María fights to live... and to keep sane.\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""I personally believe that starting over almost never accomplishes what people hope it to. I agree that coloring your pages could be a smart idea if you want to go with color, but if you're finally happy with your pages and your story, don't lose that momentum now by going back and redoing things. A lot of people here have given you some great advice for how to spruce some things up with your presentation, I would definitely try to incorporate some of that, and just ride the momentum of you liking where your story is going."", 'The short answer? Don\'t reboot it. You said yourself that this is a recurring problem for you, where you scrap it all the time. If you keep starting it over it\'ll never get finished. It\'s better to finish something and move on than to regurgitate the same ideas and try to make it work several times. Sometimes the stuff we make won\'t be a hit, and that\'s okay--it\'s very seldom that someone gets a big break from their first or even fifth series. If all you\'ve been doing for a decade is working on this one series and you keep throwing away your progress, but also refuse to move onto something fresher, you\'re just shooting yourself in the foot. Complete this one, then take what you learned from it and apply it to your next project. \nYou can even just put it down right now, do something else that\'s shorter to experiment and hone your skills, then come back to it. Your progress on it doesn\'t have to be linear.\nOne practical thing you kind of messed up on was uploading with such huge episodes, though. Most people post 1 page at a time, MAYBE 2-3 pages if it\'s a long form. Uploading like this meant that your comic got VERY limited visibility. Every time your series updates, it gets put to the front of the new/fresh section, which makes it easier to discover. You have 18 episodes right now... so that means 18 chances for people to catch your comic. If you had posted 2 pages at a time? You\'d have like 200 episodes, and 200 chances to get your work in front of people. So whenever you upload again, I would make sure you do it in smaller chunks.\nFrom here on out, I\'m going to be a little more picky on the actual quality of the work. It is not intended to be harsh, but it may come off that way. You don\'t have to read on if you don\'t want to.\nSummary\nThe art, while not the most important thing, is making it difficult for me to read this comic. The linework is so thin and you don\'t vary any of your lines between character or background that it\'s just difficult to parse what\'s happening. I find myself having to stare at a panel to figure out what\'s going on. Later you add in blacks and grays, which help a LOT, but I think you would do well to work on making your lineart more discernable by adding bolder lines, varying widths, etc.\nI want to really encourage you to learn anatomy. There\'s nothing wrong with stylizing, but right now there isn\'t much form or solidity to your characters, and the only way to achieve that is learning how the skeleton, muscles, and fat distribution works. Everyone looks maybe 14 and it\'s hard to take seriously. Eventually you\'ll also want to focus on foreshortening, perspective, motion, etc. but for now, I think anatomy and varying your shapes will be more important. (The lack of forehead on your characters super bugs me  )\nYou have this tendency to use cliche motion, too--and I don\'t mean this in the writing sense, I mean visually. Your expressions look like they\'re pasted on rather than a part of the face, and your action shots look like the pose was picked because it\'s ""cool"", not because it\'s functional.\nI will ALWAYS plug this tutorial on expressions from Tracy Butler. Read through it! I\'m seeing a lot of ""generi-expressions"" from you.https://www.lackadaisy.com/exhibit.php?exhibitid=333\nShe\'s also a great study point to see how much those foundational skills really shine through stylized work. You can tell she knows what she\'s doing!\nAs for the writing... disclaimer, I only had time to read the first two chapters, so this may not reflect your later work as well.\nWhile it\'s good to throw your reader into the world to some extent and not over explain, I feel like I\'m missing important context on what kind of world this is. You have little snippets of character flashbacks, but they\'re randomly placed and don\'t actually tell me much. There are some things that I see and think, ""are they trying to imply X with this line of dialogue?"", but it\'s never quite clear enough (or I don\'t have enough information) to make the call on whether it\'s intentional or not. I still have no idea if the different fantasy races have different social standings, are segregated, or are more rare or common than others either.\nIt\'s important to be upfront at least with some details for the main cast so we know their situation before they get into the plot. Establish their normal so when the narrative breaks it, it has an impact.\nYou\'re using a lot of low hanging fruit when it comes to comedy and the character writing. The tone of the beginning with the ape siblings was really goofy, but the way you framed the action implied you still wanted me to take it seriously? You can mesh humor with a serious tone, but it needs a more deft hand than that. It might be better to focus on one or the other before tackling a combination of both. As for the dialogue, it was smooth in a lot of areas but then they\'d randomly say a stock phrase that came off like, ""this is what you\'re supposed to say in this moment"", rather than part of a conversation.\nThe impression I get overall is that the ideas aren\'t bad, but you don\'t have the skill to execute it well in either arena (art or writing).\nAnd knowing all that? I STILL don\'t think you should reboot. Don\'t waste your time. Focus on improving your craft and have fun, don\'t sweat the readership. This comic likely won\'t get a huge following right now, and I know that hurts. But as long as you focus on yourself and keep moving forward, you\'ll get to a point where your work will grab people.\n\nYou will only improve by studying, putting in the work, and finishing a lot of things. Keep going, and don\'t look back.', ""Huge thanks to everyone for your advice.\nHonestly, hearing the ways I was screwing up really helps.I think I know the angle I need to take now.\nI really appreciate you taking the time to help me out.I honestly can't thank you enough."", ""Well, i can only tell my own story, dunno how useful it will be. \nI rebooted my first comic 3 times. The first time because the drawings look like crap and weren't sure if the story was good. Then the second version I did, i felt the art was TOO detailed, that i wouldn't be able to do that on a weekly basis, so then I thought after TWO YEARS with this story/comic, i was ready with the third reboot and i put it on webtoons/tapas, etc. The result after my third reebot? zero subscribers, likes or comments. \nThat's when i learned to never marry a story, and instead, just scratch that one comic and try doing other comics until i made some that people seemed to respond (at least got two comics with over 1k subs on webtoon). I had to try different things and even had to change genres, as my first comic was action shounen inspired, and got nothing, when i switch to do romance girls love stories is what seems to be working for me now. \nBut well....that's my story, maybe your comic will have a different outcome, who knows.""]",12/11/2020 7:50,https://forums.tapas.io/t/should-i-restart-my-comic-trading-feedback-for-feedback/52425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The room was dark, except for the light that came through the crack in the door. Cole settled into the armchair facing the door and waited. Lenny had given him a name.
Pieter “Patch” Kohler was a hacker for hire who specialized in finding people. He had spent five years in prison for “finding” girls through the web cameras during their personal moments. Cole tried to control his temper as he waited. Someone had hired this creep to track his daughter. They were both going to pay. The door swung open as Patch stumbled in, blindly fumbling for the light switch.
“Hello Patch,” Cole said calmly. A shaft of light fell across Cole’s blue-gray eyes. 
“I-it’s you,” Patch gulping, spotting his guest.
“Yes,” Cole pointed to the chair opposite him with the tip of his knife. “Sit down. Now…” Patch, nervously, sank into the chair opposite of Cole.
“I’m here, now… W-what do you want?” Cole slid a photograph across the low table between them. Patch looked at the photograph quickly before pushing it away. “I don’t know her.”
“I think you do,” Cole slowly twirled his knife around his fingers. “Look again.”
Patch nervously wrung his hands as he looked between Cole and the photograph. His heart pounded in his ears. “I told you that I don’t know.”
Cole leaned forward, twirling the knife in his hand. Patch began to pant. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. “You know who I am,” Cole said softly. “And you know what I’m capable of. You have sixty seconds to tell me who hired you to take this picture. One. Two… Three…”

Cole stomped out of the room, ignoring Patch’s pained whimpers. All that mattered was that he had a name now and when Cole got his hands on the man; he’d kill him.

","[""Hello! \nInitially it's interesting. It reminds me a lot of the Taken movies.There are two things that stand out as things that would potentially deter me from reading further. The first one is the use of ellipses and stuttering. Both of these can be used really well sparingly (in my opinion). When there's a lot of them I feel like they tend to take the place of describing the characters feeling/behaviors. I'd recommend saying your dialogue out loud to check if those pauses are actually adding something or if they're just drawing things out. The second is about the character Patch. For a guy whose been to prison for (I'm assuming) participating in human trafficking he seems easily startled and unseasoned. This might have to do with Cole's reputation/character, but I'd like to see a little more confrontation to make the scene more tense. I do like that Cole is hanging out in Patch's (apartment? house? living room?) waiting for him as an ambush. I also like the irony in that the guy who finds people got found!"", ""Good ideas!

Cole’s hand clamped around the other man’s mouth as he pulled him into the shadows.\n“Hello Patch,” Cole said calmly. He flicked on the lamp on the side table next to Cole’s chair. A shaft of light fell across Cole’s blue-gray eyes.\n“I-it’s you,” Patch gulped. He tried to stand up, but his hands and feet were bound to the chair.\n“Yes, it’s me.” Cole slid a photograph across the low table and pointed to it with the tip of his knife. “Look at it.” It was one of the photographs of Jamie that had been taken by a security camera, a camera that Patch had taken control of.\nPatch gulped and looked away from the picture. “I don’t know her.”\n“I think you do,” Cole slowly twirled his knife around his fingers. “Look again.”\nPatch’s knuckles whitened as he looked between Cole and the photograph.

Could maybe be a little neater, and I agree with magnavarra, it could do with more difference between characters and background in terms of saturation and value, but overall it\'s not bad art-wise.\nThe main thing that I noticed was that the panel layouts were quite adventurous, but often not for a clear reason. Like it felt like often you\'d chosen to do something interesting with the angle or cropping or putting a single image across two panels without there being a clear reason for it other than it\'s interesting. Usually a single image across two panels is meant to portray a break in time while the physical action stays still (though I\'ve also personally used it to show a ""break"" or a wedge being driven between two characters). It\'s good to try things with panel layouts and to push yourself with angles, but try to think about why you\'re using a specific shot distance or angle and what it\'s adding to the story. \nThe other compositional thing is that overall, there are a lot of panels that are one person seen from roughly the waist up standing in the middle of the panel at a mid-shot distance. Try to mix things up a bit with some longer establishing shots, and showing two characters sharing the same space.

283,Need help with important scene i want to get right (Any tips or tricks?),Reviews | Feedback,[],"I need opinions really quickly. Is this a good betrayal seen? It takes place at the beginning of season 3 where season 2 left of with the closest friend of the main character (Varicin) having fallen under the control of my main villain (Orien) and Varicin blew up the capital and it leads to this sense where the main character (The main character is Lexy) still cares about their friend but their friend betrays them. I want it to be heartbreaking but also eye-opening for the main character. That is a world of war you must be careful who you trust.
The fallowing is what i wrote.
It’s a beautiful day outside and Lexy hates it. She can only stare at the wasteland that is left of the capital. The harsh winter wind beginning to blow. Miko looks to the girl her expression is unreadable. He then looks ahead “A storm is coming. You should get to cover.”She ignores the ghost's comment and instead begins walking and looking. Looking for her friend.The blond walks through the rubble, through the glass.She doesn’t care that she keeps cutting her hands, as long as Varicin is fine. She will be fine, right?She can see the storm brewing and the sun will be setting in two hours or less. She’s used spare bandages from her pack to cover her hands. The blood still seeps through.That’s when through the sun's light she sees Varicin standing, breathing, alive!Without thinking and ignoring the warnings. She rushes to Varicin only to stop when she sees Orien.Lexy looks to Varicin. The wonder wolf is in his human form and has his back turned to her.The blond notes in silence how Varicin isn’t attacking Orien. “Varicin?” She asks worriedly.The wolf doesn’t respond and Orien only smiles. She walks closer “Varicin? Buddy, turn around.”Varicin did as asked, however. He turns on a dime and gives her a harsh swipe from his hand. His nails like claws leaving deep wounds over her face.She registered the pain before the action. The force makes her stagger back. Her own blood trickling down her face and invading her vision.Her baby blue eyes widen as she stares at him tears forming and mixing with the warm blood “Varicin? How could you.”Varicin stares down at her and chuckles “You know, the first thing I said to you right? I remember what I said. First off, I’m not a dog you nitwit I’m a wolf. Second, you are either stupid or brave and the third fight for your life. So, let me state this clear for you, I’m not your dog. I’ve concluded you’re only a solder nor hero nor a villain. You are only gray and third.” He smiles, his teeth glimmer in the sunset's light as he summons dark magic to his fingers. “Fight for your life.”
( i just really want this one to go well cuz it's important. Please lend me your opinion.)","['I\'m not going to go too much into detail about the writing as I will assume that this is an unedited draft that you shared. As for the descriptions, they\'re not bad but you have quite a few formatting issues (ending a sentence too soon, putting full stops instead of question marks,...) so definitely look at that. \nFor the actual scene, it is hard to tell whether or not I would feel the ""betrayal"" in this because I am not a reader who knows the story. The best I can suggest is make sure that the betrayal is somewhat foreshadowed but not obvious. When a character ends up betraying someone, you have to make sure that your readers go ""Oh! That makes sense!"" instead of ""Ehm... Excuse me?"" But for that, you need to work on the actual build up to that scene long before it happens. \nLastly, and this IS an actual issue I suggest you remake is the dialogue. I tend to be very picky with dialogue and the one you gave the person who betrayed her is so repetitive and mechanic. It doesn\'t sound like a human talking. First and foremost, don\'t repeat information like I said. For example, he says that he is not a dog twice in the span of one paragraph. There\'s no need for that, we got the point the first time. And also the final ""Fight for your life."" is 1. Repetitive, and 2. Not giving me any strong vibes. This is why you need to play around with punctuation better. I assume he is yelling, but the sentence is written with a dot. I am getting mixed signals and can\'t register how to imagine it basically. And please, use commas properly... I\'ll try to rewrite that dialogue alone for you but this same kind of treatment needs to be granted to your descriptions. \nVaricin stared her down with a menacing chuckle. ""You know (comma not needed) the first thing I told you, right? (the next sentence is repetition, not necessary. By him mentioning if she remembers, we can assume that HE remembers). First off, I\'m not a dog, you nitwit; I\'m a wolf. Second... (this sentence makes no sense to me and I am not sure what he is trying to say so I will only assume)... I\'m still not sure if you are stupid or brave... You\'re only a soldier—not a hero, nor a villain. (I don\'t get the sentence with gray and third?) Which brings me to my third and final point... Fight for your life!""\n(as a side note, this is a battle field, right? How come he can speak for so long without being interrupted? Sorry about being nitpicky but when it comes to dialogue, I always need it to be as realistic as possible )', ""No no you're right. Thanks this means a lot. and yeah first draft. I felt the dialogue was repetitive and not quite sure about some of the sentences. Thank you so much!  Constructive criticism is exactly what I needed.  Edit: not a battlefield more of a wasteland people have been evacuated it's only her, two ghosts, Varicin and Orien. Sorry ill try and make things clearer. This means a lot to me for you to take your time and do this so thank you. "", '\n\nmilejdyvan:\nThe best I can suggest is make sure that the betrayal is somewhat foreshadowed but not obvious. When a character ends up betraying someone, you have to make sure that your readers go ""Oh! That makes sense!"" instead of ""Ehm... Excuse me?""\nYES. Exactly what I was going to type', 'This whole situation reminds me of dragon age 2 when Anders blows up the chantry. That game is not the best but that scene was pretty good out of context. Maybe have a look at how they do it? Personally I’d consider have the main character realize they’ve been betrayed without getting to talk to wolf boy face to to face it possible. Betrayal is more effective if there are lingering questions. At least initially', ""Ok ill post the improved part and as for foreshadowing I showed in previous parts where Varicin kidnap's one of the side characters because they found out about plans to blow up the capital of the kingdom.

The wonder wolf is in his human form and has his back turned to her.The blond notes in silence how Varicin isn’t attacking Orien. “Varicin?” She asks worriedly.The wolf doesn’t respond and Orien only smiles. She walks closer and the worry grows “Varicin? Bud, turn around.”Varicin did as asked, however. He turns on a dime and gives her a harsh swipe from his hand.

Her own blood trickling down her face and invading her vision.Her baby blue eyes widen as she stares at him tears forming and mixing with the warm blood.

How could you.”Varicin stares down at her and chuckles “You know one of the first things I said to you, right?” He smiles, his teeth glimmer in the light of the sunset as he summons dark purple magic to his fingers. “Fight for your life!”\n(Anything else i should fix??)""]",12/7/2020 0:25,https://forums.tapas.io/t/need-help-with-important-scene-i-want-to-get-right-any-tips-or-tricks/52223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
284,Read for read for newer authors[Fantasy/Novels],Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey there!
I am looking to set up a small read for read service for newer authors. Us newcomers have to flock together so we can all grow together 
I will not give a ""below no of subs"" requirement, but I would prefer novels in the fantasy genre by less discovered authors. The only concrete rule is that you choose the no of chapters and respond in kind. If you want me to read 5 chapters, you read 5 chapters of my story. Let's agree on a minimum of 5 chapters read to a maximum of 10 chapters read. And post a comment on each chapter when you see something you like.
If you are feeling generous, throw a sub or like my way and I will respond in kind.
Bear in mind that occasionally real life can get in my way, so be patient and do not despair if I haven't gotten to your story yet. I will try to keep an updated list of how far I am along. I will reserve the right to pause accepting new people if I feel I might be getting overwhelmed.
Rules:Fantasy Novels by newer authorsNo of chapters 5-10 and we do a 1:1 exchangeComment on each chapter when you see something you likeBe patient and understanding
Just post your link and number of chapters you want I will get back to you.The link to my story is below.

285,📚 Can you help us by giving feedback on our interactive romance reading app? Thank you! 📚,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello friends!
We are a small, mostly female and non-binary team working on a new kind of romance book reading app where all the stories are interactive (at certain points decided by the author you can choose between two story plot options, kinda like the good old ‘choose your own adventure’ books, except for romance!) We also want to make something that is much more fair than some of the current apps out there, for both readers and authors alike (no micropayments, 25% of subscription fees are shared with authors etc.)
We are at the beginning of our journey with the app, and would really appreciate some feedback from avid readers and writers like you. Our team is full of romance fans, fanfiction & short story authors, game professionals and reading enthusiasts, but we are still only less than 10 people. We want to create an app that is fun and easy to use, and we hope to also understand what people think about having choices in their romance books. Do they make the stories better, or are they just a distraction? What makes up the perfect romance reading experience? 
Could you please help us out by checking app & writing tool out and giving us some feedback? This is still work in progress and we're happy to receive any thoughts, ideas & feedback, either good or bad! All feedback will help us improve

286,Help with cover ideas,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey! So. I've been plotting out my spin-off to ""The Love of a Werewolf."" It has a current working title of ""The Mechanic and the Wolf.' When I get around to posting it, I want to have a cover commissioned for it with my two MC's. I have two ideas for it that I quickly drew out and was wondering which you guys think would be better? I want to have a super clear idea of what I'm wanting before I commission anything, but I have next to no knowledge about art/covers

I am not an artist. Please don't judge me for my badly drawn concept (or my really bad handwriting) lmao
Cover 1 The mechanic is leaning against the car he's been working on. He's wiping his hands off on a rag. The werewolf is standing with an envelope in hand for the mechanic. This example is most like a scene planned for the novel. 

IMG_8130.jpg1808x2419 643 KB

Cover 2The mechanic is giving the werewolf pats (how to draw arms/hands???) either on the head or shoulder/chest. The wolf is holding the envelope in his mouth this time and has his front feet up on the mechanic's chest. This one is my personal favorite (because happy wolf!), but since it's a BL I wasn't sure if it'd be better for it to have the werewolf as a human like in Cover 1 or not.

IMG_8129.jpg1808x2419 601 KB
","[""Since You said its BL, I think cover 2 is better because it looks more intimate(not as in overly intimate, I mean it as more familiar and trusting with each other)  than the first, the first cover looks like they're not close and distant to each other -- it gives the impression that they're more like buddies rather than a couple.\nQuestion Regarding cover 2: is the werewolf mostly in human form or in wolf form throughout the story? -- since you said its BL, if most of the scenes, the werewolf is in human form, I think it's better to incorporate it to the cover itself to give the readers an idea what the werewolf character looks like in human form  since the human form appears more frequently in the story. BUT if throughout the story, the werewolf appears more frequently in wolf form, then keep the cover to your original idea to put a happy wolf in cover  since it will appear more frequent in the story."", ""\n\nEiranyx:\nis the werewolf mostly in human form or in wolf form throughout the story?\nAt the beginning he's more often in wolf form, but as it goes on, he hangs out as a human more often.

There isn't anything necessarily wrong with his backstory or motivation, he just talks about it a lot while seeming to only act as a reaction to misinformation about the protagonist, and he seems fairly reluctant and less than eager for that.  He also doesn't seem all that threatening. This protagonist is extremely cocky and extremely strong, so to make somebody seem threatening, he really does need to properly get a beatdown and appear to be in real danger of losing before he digs deep to overcome it and win, and maybe learns something or shows us there's more to him than we thought.If he pulled out some kind of absolutely killer iconic technique or weapon that seems unbeatable and really scared the protagonist a bit, I feel like he'd be a more effective villain and also somebody readers would be more excited to see return as either a recurring villain or (in true shounen manga fashion) an ally later."", ""Damn you're right, i made him way more talkative than he should've been, maybe i should've used a narrator or the other characters like his goons to do the exposition, I really messed up there, no one likes a talkative character unless its a monologue of idealogy, maybe what i'll do is I'll angle his character to want to understand the protagonist to be the reason why he's more talkative than usual and have the goons point that out at some point in the arc so his character wont be contradictory for no reason.\nI didn't want to make the character a villain, just an antagonist role that's a contrast to the main character in almost every aspect that way readers can get the feeling that the protagonist isn't exactly a good person and have them actually root for the antagonist more, so basically i just wanted to switch their roles in the eyes of the viewer, but of course i do plan to have him do some really cool shonen stuff.""]",12/3/2020 6:50,https://forums.tapas.io/t/what-do-you-think-of-my-antagonists-characterisation-and-my-comic-episodes/52088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When life gets you down, what do you do? Act like you're a little bit buzzed, let down those inhibitions and live it to the full - that's what! Join Isaac and Miles as they do just that, relishing in the 'fake' lives they've created together. But...





","[""Its kind of boring and uninteresting, I barely know the character, I didnt have much of a clue as to where he was until like the 3rd chapter (and as someone with experience with airports theres more things that just dont make sense). The narrative feels a little sporadic and not entirely linear. Guy is butt hurt about couples in an airport on Christmas day as hes sitting in a lounge by himself at what im guessing is a bar? Random guy just pops up and gives him free tickets and theres barely any kind of real dialogue other than some awkward and out of place flirting. It isnt horrible just kind of poorly executed. Some panels look kind of rushed so sometimes it just looks weird like a hand shot that didnt completely rub me the right way. Probably wouldnt hurt to flesh out your characters more because even with the four chapters I barely know what the names of these characters are.\nBut like any criticism you can take this anyway you want to. Just keep doing your best, you'll get the hang for it."", ""I see! I appreciate your honest feedback  that's exactly why I posted - to see what I need to work on. You've certainly given me a lot to think about!"", 'I didn\'t get why his ""favorite place in the world is tainted"" at all. It\'s an airport on Christmas, so what\'s that that annoys him, the couples, the atmosphere of Christmas? Otherwise everything you show us look like a typical airport atmosphere, so I didn\'t get his frustration.\nSome of their reactions are a bit over the top. It\'s not bad by itself, but some of them look somewhat out of place, like when Miles saying about the ticket and Isaac almost crashing with his chair, and then Miles\' ""I know I know"" reaction. \nWhen it comes to discussing the destination point, Miles is so excited to give this ticket to the point it\'s almost strange (and somewhat creepy), because we don\'t see Isaac\'s reaction. He\'s saying ""I always wanted to go there"", then we read a few exited lines from Miles, then doubtful sentences (with lots of dots) from Isaac. I think if we actually saw his reactions to what Miles is saying would make this scene better. Does he hesitate? Is he interested? Is he okay with other guy being so exited? Is he excited too?\nOverall it\'s a pretty nice start, it looks like you really have a story you want to tell, your choice of panels is quite good! \nI think the comic lacks the atmosphere somewhat, probably because of the lack of establishing shots and very basic colours on the grey background. Maybe using more background shots would be better, like when Miles is saying ""This is a happy place"", and apparently is showing the loud airport, but...you don\'t show it, so we cannot relate. Don\'t shy away from backgrounds, you\'re doing fine Sooooo yeah, best of luck, remember that everything will become even better with time! ', 'I think the concept is pretty solid and the art is getting there and will improve with time, but this mostly needs a bit of work on the visual storytelling, especially in terms of setting up the scene and giving a sense of place and tone.\nOne of the main issues here is a lack of a sense of continuity between the panels because we never get one clear establishing shot of the character in the airport, and then when a second character appears, we don\'t see the two characters in the same panel, so you can\'t really get the sense that they\'re sharing the space. Every panel is isolated, showing just a close-up fragment of the scene, like here\'s a bit of background, here\'s a couple, here\'s the character, and the expressions are so extreme every panel and change so drastically between panels, it feels like a montage rather than one cohesively storyboarded scene.\nIf you only make panels for the most impactful moments that are big, loud closeups, it becomes a bunch of noise. Pull the camera out a bit, show us the character in the place.\nie. PANEL: We see an airport full of happy couples and families.PANEL: We see another part of the airport, where there are more couples and families but in this shot we can also see a bar, and sat at that bar, with a large area of empty space around him is the only person in the shot who is on his own. (maybe use a shot from above to really clearly show the space here and how lonely and insignificant he is).PANEL: We zoom in on the man, isolated, with his drink, he says ""I must be some kind of masochist...""\nThen you\'d show the little shots of the couples and families and the monologue. As the main character despairs, showing either the confused reaction or uncaring lack of any reaction by the people around the airport would really help sell how out of place he is, and also help sell the punch in that punchline.\nWhen the second character enters the scene, it\'s important to show both characters together so we get a sense of who has entered from where and where they are in relation to everything else, and how that affects the balance of the space. \nIf you haven\'t read ""Making Comics"" by Scott McCloud yet, I highly recommend it. It\'d be great for your development. Try to think carefully about why you\'re choosing certain panel compositions in terms of things like shot distance, angle and use of space. It\'ll really level up your work!']",11/15/2020 18:04,https://forums.tapas.io/t/id-love-your-thoughts-before-i-get-too-far/51412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*Updates every Monday @12pm EST
 Cassandra-Elle was one of the worlds most powerful witches, before having most of her power sealed away that is. Now she, and her adventure seeking, yet powerfully shy girlfriend Raelynn, are on a quest to regain...





","[""I saw lesbian witches and somebody asking for comic feedback, you may as well have made a summoning circle specifically for me. \nAll right, so the main thing I'd say here is that this is a comic with a lot of potential that's really only lacking in polish. I do think redoing some pages up to the standard of the new art would be good, and my highest priority would be those first few black and white pages.\nThe problem with opening a comic with some kind of backstory or explanation of the world done in a vastly different art style is that the first few pages of your comic are the first thing the reader sees, and set up the expectation for what this comic will look like.Here, I can see the necessity of the sequence being in a different style, but I would suggest a couple of fixes:1. Add a cover in the regular style as the first thing the reader sees rather than that first page to reassure them that the comic will have full colour, not-inverted art later.2. Make the art less messy. I think being inverted is enough for these pages; they don't really need to be scribbly too. It mostly just makes them look like they were done in a rush, and it reflects badly on the rest of the comic when the first thing you see is a bunch of pages that look a lot more rushed and amateurish than the art in the rest of the comic.\nOther things I noticed were:\n\nThe speech bubbles definitely have a negative effect on how polished the overall comic looks. It would look immediately more professional if the bubbles gave the text more breathing space and if the dialogue was in a font with a more comic book feel. I've written tutorial before on how to do speech bubbles, so check that out maybe3.\nThe figures are well-drawn, but the clothing and fabric is a weak area that pulls everything down. The characters and faces have good expressions and anatomy, but the clothing is just haphazard wobbly lines with no sense of shape. It'd really make the characters more three-dimensional and dynamic if you could spend some time studying how fabrics crease, wrap and drape and giving your clothing more love. I skipped ahead, and there has definitely been significant improvement on this area, but it's still an area I'd recommend to put in some work. Some tutorials I like on this subject:https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/846465692458321453/3https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/291326669650948479/1https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/428123508326740376/2\nThe environments have a bit of a flat feeling. I appreciate the work put into them, and in fact prefer that in the early pages, there's a greater variety of shot distance and attempts at backgrounds to the current pages where every panel feels cropped so closely around the characters it felt a bit claustrophobic (though I understand it's a fight scene, it's important to pull back to show the space between the combatants at times to help the reader understand the flow of the battle, and also to give the close-up shots more impact). If like me, you struggle with building a large, detailed environment from scratch and keeping it consistent, there's nothing wrong with building or using a 3D model to use for reference. It can really help. Happy to advise further on this!\n\nOverall, this is solid on the fundamentals, and there's nothing wrong with the storytelling or dialogue. Really it just needs some polish to make it look a bit more tightly drawn and professionally presented."", ""Oh man! Such a detailed response! Thank you so much! I'm at work at the moment so I'll deep dive into this later, i just wanted to thank you. Even at a glance there's so much good advice. Particularly the initial point on my opening. I see what your saying completely and agree.

Halloween. I mean, even on fast paced scene, I'd relate it to classical music, specifically violin.\nOh, I'd also say, it's kinda... foggy and cloudy? Not as in unclear on the story or that, but the whole atmosphere feels a little foggy. Like, the scene on the first chapter when Lisa was approached by some strangers, it feels like a foggy road in a black-and-white movie.\nThings I'm reminded of would be... grandpa clock, and wooden floor. And night time. I feel like my mind constantly decide that every scene happens during the dead of night lol.\nThe color I'd relate to... hm... brown, definitely. Shades of brown.

Does it remind you of policemen or knife or ghost or moon or whatever? What colours can you relate this story with?\n-As for vibes, I got a strong dark modern fantasy feel to it. A supernatural YA vibe, that I only classify as a fantasy because it uses magic rather than science. Also, while it wasn't outright said what era this took place in, it felt a little old timey--so I saw it as sort of steampunk in my head. Not full bioshock or anything, but just enough to feel like an alternate victorian universe.\n-With the steampunk vibe, I'd associate it with dark greens, blacks, and golds."", ""Aight I had enough time so I read up the first seven chapters of your novel and I got to say it's probably one of the better novels I read on Tapas so far.

Well done!\nWith that being said...\n\nI actually got a bit of a mystery vibe from your story. With the way the police men just happily had a drink with the two attackers made me believe there was some conspiracy going on there. There were also some spooky vibes but the mystery theme was the most present for me.\nColours I'd relate your story with would probably be: Orange to a small extent (this was a given considering the eye colour shift), mauve purple (which fits the mystery and spooky vibe for me), teal to an extent (when the ghost appears)\n"", ""@rajillustration Thank you for your response.

301,Looking to praise some comics!,Reviews | Feedback,[]," I was thinking about making a comic/art positivity thread the other day, but then I saw someone else doing positive reviews of comics and thought that might be fun! I find it very encouraging to hear people comment on my work and say the things that they like, so I thought I would do just that for other people~. 
So! What I'll be doing is reading through your comic and then saying what I like about it! I'll also try to leave some comments as I go through your pages. ^^ All you've got to do is:

Please give me a link to your comic!
Tell me about your comic in, at most, one short paragraph to give me an idea what it's about and what I should expect! 

EDIT: I'll be skipping around the thread, so if I don't get to your comic right away, don't fret! I plan to get to everyone's comics in due time--I just want to make sure I'm in the right headspace for your comic so I can read it properly.
EDIT 2: I would like to encourage other people to also praise some comics in this thread that they enjoy, either by giving comments or maybe giving a little review of your own! If you decide to do a nice review of your own, I'll add it to the list here at the top of the thread. 
Just as a note, though, before you post your comic for me, I should say there is a restriction to what I will read:

As far as mature content is concerned, I will read blood, gore, violence, etc, but I will not read stories with heavy/predominant sexual themes or content.
Other than that, just about anything goes!

Can't wait to read some comics!

302,Reviewing Three Comics!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Good afternoon Tapas forum users, I wanted to do some comic reviews as a way to give back to this extremely supportive and informative community. 
Here's just a couple stipulations before we get started:

For now I only want to take 3 comics to review as I haven't formally reviewed works before. I'll stop replying to the thread after I get three and reply to the people I'm reviewing in this thread.

I'm not much of a writer but I'll try to point out anything I can/notice story and dialogue wise.
Let me know if there's something in your comic you want me to focus on! Specific art elements, pacing, color, ect.
I'll be blunt and straightforward with my review.

Thanks @AbelDraws for being the first to jump in for a review. Let\'s get started:\nComic Review: FIVE by Abeldraws\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nFIVE | Tapas\nA story about a boy named Arckan, whose life will change forever for the worse due to his newfound powers and Krisos\' doings.\n\n* Updates every Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\'ll start with tackling one of the first things readers will see when clicking on your comic: the summary.\n""A story about a boy named Arckan, whose life will change forever for the worse due to his newfound powers and Krisos\' doings.""\nHow you\'ve set up your summary tells me the main character is a boy named Arckan, and his newfound powers ONLY make his life worse. But since they’re SUPERpowers, won’t they ever come in handy for him? Do his powers ever save his life, and can you write more lighthearted/comedic scenes with his powers? If so maybe you can mention there are pros and cons to this new power.\nAnd who is Krisos? Krisos does... something. But what? Is it an organization? A person? I have no idea with this summary. Here\'s a quick rewrite I did:\nA young boy awakens a powerful ability to stop time, but an evil organization will stop at nothing to find the source of his powers and put his life in danger in the process.""(My rewrite is corny, but it introduces a clear conflict and an intriguing superpower.)\n\n(Quick note: your thumbnail looks great, but I would personally remove the title in it. The thumbnail is already so tiny, I don’t think any text should distract from the art!)\nThe Comic:\nimage.png565x792 72.4 KB\nSo right off the bat, I\'m not pulled in by the first cover art, even after rereading your comic and seeing how you cleverly use visual elements that pop up in the first chapter. Since FIVE is about a boy that can randomly (unintentionally) stop time, I think you can make really mysterious but intriguing art with it. One of your early pages has good potential to create into a cover:\nimage.png572x762 253 KB\n\nThe cover art could be Arckan standing scared, worried, as he\'s the only thing in full color compared to a timeless, black-and-white world. And even though we as the readers wouldn\'t know that at first glance, it\'d be eye-catching and tie into the comic soon after reading. Or, put Arckan in the middle of the road as you did in a previous page, as oncoming traffic is coming. But of course, time is stopped and Arckan faces us (or maybe the traffic) in full color, with the world monochrome. I think you can do so many cool scenes as promo art and I’m sure you’ve already got cool scenarios set up too \n\nimage.png593x566 448 KB\nFIVE has a very charming start but I think it\'s better off without Arckan\'s little character sheet on page 1. It\'s better to show information like age and likes/dislikes over time through exposition and character building; it\'s also much more interesting for readers to collect tidbits of character’s personality over time. And for example, in that mini character-bio you mention Arckan loves dogs almost as much as they love him. You show Arckan and Tara\'s friendship very well from page 1, so there\'s no need to even mention it!\nPanelling:\nYour colors and panelling look great! The flow of panels feels natural and each page pops with color, until it doesn’t! Which is a good thing, because the way you juxtapose normal time (bright color) and frozen time (bleak greys and white lines) works to set the mood against each other. I feel Arckan\'s dread as he runs home and finds out even his Mom is frozen. There’s such a good atmosphere and helplessness from him.\nimage.png827x667 454 KB\n\nBackgrounds:Overall your backgrounds compliment your comic well and your use of colors feels harmonious with the characters (I especially appreciate that your characters pop from their surroundings, but that they still HAVE surroundings. Lots of people completely avoid backgrounds and leave the characters in a void most of the time  )\n3d models could be good for you to tackle perspective better. And I say this because I enjoyed all the backgrounds and details and time you put in. I understand the characters’ world and they feel they belong in it. And coming from a person that doesn\'t like drawing backgrounds, I\'ve found meshing 3D backgrounds with my art has FREED me. I feel like I can focus on drawing what\'s important to me, while there are still times when I draw backgrounds as needed.\nTo improve in this area I’d be careful about how you draw objects. Organic objects can have snakier lines, but objects like buildings and cars will look a lot more convincing with straighter lines. Like 90% of the time you follow this rule (I know some people don\'t like ruler-straight lines for buildings/tables, but... I LIKE them lol), however there are some minor areas you don\'t follow this:\nIn the background are referenced guns which are highly realistic, then the window to the right that’s all wobbly and imprecisely drawn. I do understand this scene uses some fish-eye lense to create tension, which is great, but placing these two drawing styles together is jarring and they don’t mesh. So just being cautious about how you place background elements together would be good.\nRandom image, but I found this stock photo with an anime-esque feeling for pretty simple shapes for the buildings. I thought a style like this could compliment your art without going crazy on detail (just shapes, colors, and gradients).\nAnd for interiors of cars, buildings, ect, again 3D models are the way to go in my opinion haha. I do see you using them in some scenes (the outside of the villains’ van for example) and you’ve meshed it with your style well:But just another small nitpick with this above scene, I would personally shade that truck with a little more cell-shading like the characters. However, keep doing small airbrushing and gradients in the backgrounds as you’re doing; it sets apart the world from the characters nicely.\nPacing/storytelling:\nUp to Arckan getting the ability to stop time, running home scared to his mother, waking up and forgetting his power for 6 years, I think the story flows really well. As I mentioned before, I love the absolute dread Arckan has as he runs home. And it feels like what a little kid would genuinely do: cover his whole body under his covers and pray this scary situation goes away.\nSo the story continues and Arckan walks home from school.\nimage.png512x738 442 KB\nI love this page as the change of color in the background sets up great tension and danger. \nOnce Arckan is taken to the van, the thug ""B"" says this:So, this guy measures how long it takes to handcuff Arckan. I think there\'s a less on-the-nose way of stating it. Like, ""Each second counts, you know what can happen if you hesitate."" This would set up dread in both Arckan and the reader, and from the villains’ POV, a need to be quick since it would imply they’ve had bad run-ins with Arckan’s type of power before. \nSomething else that doesn\'t sell the kidnapping scene for me: they\'re kidnapping a kid in broad daylight, at an open park, with cars in the background? And they just walk up to their creeper van? This makes the organization just look sloppy. Judging by their formidable appearances, I’d expect them to be more professional and quick with picking up targets. (Maybe picking up targets at night or around wooded areas, and finding a way to more subtly transfer Arckan to the car). Details like this are what readers will nitpick too, so it\'s good practice to show your work to friends/other artists and ask not only for proofreading, but if what\'s happening makes sense/is believable.\nChapter 2 Page 12 - Arckan\'s shoulders spike up as if it\'s a comedy scene. This effect would rarely, if ever, happen in a serious panel. As far as I’ve seen, this is an anime trope for comedic effect. The setup of this panel and the colored background really make it seem like it\'s supposed to be funny. Instead you can heighten the drama with exaggerated shadows and creepy angles:\nSeeing your most recent updates, I like the balance of this professor guy being more sympathetic to Arckan’s situation, and him saying, “don’t know how to use your powers? We’ll show you,” got me like , so I wanna see where this goes.\nArt:Your art meshes well together and I like seeing everything you draw being on the same skill level (have you ever seen an INCREDIBLE anime artist draw hands terribly or hide them all the time? That’s a damn shame). Here are just a few things to look for in your art:\nFirst thing that pops out to me with your characters is the height of their eyes relative to their heads. Their eyes are high up on their faces making it look like their foreheads are unusually small. I feel like the eye-nose region could simply be shifted down and that would give their faces more balance:For Arckan I also fluffed out his hair a bit more on top to keep his youthful look.\nAnd for other aspects of your art… I feel everything meshes together really well already, so there’s not much to comment on except general improvement over time? Which comes along naturally with a comic  I think, I’d love to see you push weirder angles more. Instead of mostly face-on angles, trying something like this for this van interrogation:\nYou already utilize some good angles throughout but these low and high angles really would add tension to the kidnapping scene. Or imagine if this scene where Arckan is kidnapped and taken to the van, you tried out something like this to really push the tension:\nimage.png576x568 262 KB\n\nNitpick stuff:\nArckan doesn’t age much in his appearance in the 6 year jump, even though his dialogue does feel more mature, which is good. It’s a simple fix: an updated, more teen wardrobe (he\'d be 15 now, and I can\'t think of many 15 year olds who would want to wear jean overalls), maybe a slightly different hairstyle, and I think that’d be enough. But as it stands, if you didn’t tell me he was 6 years older it’d be hard to tell.\nimage.png478x729 205 KB\n\nThis is a potential nitpick: when Arckan’s getting restrained in the van, the thug saying ""shut the fuck up"" kinda threw me for a loop only because of your cuter anime style. I feel like ""shut the hell up"" is just as effective and doesn\'t throw me out of the story. Of course ignore this if you intend for this thug to be completely irredeemeable/awful.\nAnd that\'s what I have for you. I do feel like I tackled more specific concerns in your comic, but only because it\'s already a solid work on its own, so I hope I\'ve given you more pointed things to focus on. Nothing I\'ve brought up in your comic would stall you from continuing; you have a strong start and the plot/intrigue picks up right away. I’m hooked to see how it develops and if any of my thoughts have helped out! And again, thanks for being patient with me. @Hexigate and @Rhonder just bear with me a little longer, you are getting novellas too ', ""Owww thanks a lot <3 you pointed out a lot of real nice points (and I agree with almost all of them ahdjgkh), I'll give you a more detailed answer tomorrow because if I don't go to sleep soon my headache will end me x'D. \nBut seriously, thanks for taking such care in the review <3"", 'The headache is gone, yayy <3 Now I can answer properly, because there\'s some very interesting stuff here. There\'s some stuff I\'m not 100% on the same page with you, but that\'s great because that way I was able to see, in depth, how someone who\'s not familiar with the story nor knows what\'s going to happen thinks. It was really really helpful.\n\n\narleedraws:\nHow you\'ve set up your summary tells me the main character is a boy named Arckan, and his newfound powers ONLY make his life worse\n[insert nervous laugh here] For years (and a good chunk of the story), Arckan is going to despise his powers and blame averything on them, they won\'t be much more than a curse that has the potential to be used for evil. Obviously there\'ll be much more than that, tho, but he\'s not going to be a superhero at all nor change the view he has of his powers for a long time.\nI\'m very thankful you mentioned this and the Krisos part tho, since I see now how I could improve it. I\'ll take out the ""forever"" and change ""Krisos"" for ""...evil organization, Krisos, ..."", most likely<3 \n\n\narleedraws:\nThe thumbnail is already so tiny, I don’t think any text should distract from the art!\nGood point there asfjklsag the text is too tiny to be readable (or relevant at all >w>""), I\'ll remove it, thanks! (I better start not saying thanks at the end of every sentence or I\'ll run out of them lmao, but it was so nice reading this I can\'t help it hahaha).\n\n\narleedraws:\nSo right off the bat, I\'m not pulled in by the first cover art, even after rereading your comic and seeing how you cleverly use visual elements that pop up in the first chapter.\nThe covers have been something that\'s been bugging me since the beginning as well.\nI knew I wanted to have chapter covers, but I really did not want them to be something that would distract me from doing comic pages, since they\'re pretty time consuming on their own. I did not want to risk losing motivation nor time because of them, so I decided to do something kinda simple but that could work and would look nice next to each other (the plan is for all of them to follow the same aesthetic). \nThe thing is, I like the idea, but not so much the execution (they looked cooler in my head). I\'d really not want to do an illustration for every chapter (because of what I said before), so I\'ve come up with 2 options. - Drawing a book cover and adding it to the beginning of the comic (if tapas allows you to do that), so the simple cover is not the first thing you see when starting reading. - Change the covers to something else, but keeping them simple as well. \nI\'d really like to hear some opinions on this <3\n\n\narleedraws:\nit\'s better off without Arckan\'s little character sheet on page 1...You show Arckan and Tara\'s friendship very well from page 1, so there\'s no need to even mention it!\nOh, that little character sheet has some story behind it. \nI read ssss and absolutely fell in love with it, and I wanted to use the same resource it uses when introducing new characters at least one. The fact about the dogs is not meant to be relevant, it\'s really just meant as a small joke to set up the happy mood <3 And I really want the age to be stated (esp since I did horribly with Arckan\'s growth in the timeskip x\'D). I see your point, but I think I\'ll keep it \n \n\n\narleedraws:\nYour colors and panelling look great! The flow of panels feels natural and each page pops with color, until it doesn’t!\nI\'ve always been kind of a disaster with color schemes, setting the mood with color, etc etc (esp since I always run away from backgrounds almost up until now lmao), so it\'s really nice to hear this <3 I\'m trying to play with colors and experiment as much as I can here.\n\n\narleedraws:\n3d models could be good for you to tackle perspective better.\nThis this this. I really want to use sketchup or something similar for next chapter and on <3 it must be the best thing in the world to not have to worry so much about perspective and keeping everything in place. If you have any nice tutorials please send them over \n\n\narleedraws:\nIn the background are referenced guns which are highly realistic, then the window to the right that’s all wobbly and imprecisely drawn\nOh yes. Thanks for pointing it out (oh shoot askjflasg a thanks snicked in), I get so caught up in keeping up the pace of drawing pages that sometimes... This happens. I\'ll try to go back to that page (and revisit the rest) to fix stuff like that <3\n\n\narleedraws:\nI thought a style like this could compliment your art without going crazy on detail (just shapes, colors, and gradients).\nThis is a super nice example, esp because I\'ll need to draw buildings from very very far away in the next few pages <3 I\'ll try to do something like this, we\'ll see how that goes!\n\n\narleedraws:\nBut just another small nitpick with this above scene, I would personally shade that truck with a little more cell-shading like the characters.\nI was told this by......... I don\'t remember exactly who ashkjflsg I think it was a friend of mine but maybe it was someone in the forum. I tried to do so but it wouldn\'t look right, so... it ended up like that x\'D I\'ll try to find a middle ground for drawing metal in future pages <3\n\n\narleedraws:\nI think there\'s a less on-the-nose way of stating it.\nI\'m very veery happy you pointed this out, but for the opposite reason one might think x\'D B is, purposely, being an ass. Spoilers below:\nSummary\nThe girl is his daughter and, because of some stuff, he\'s not... The best father out there x\'D He\'s in charge of her training, but considers her to be useless and weak (and makes sure to remind her of such, like in this scene) because she didn\'t inherit his powers (it\'s just an excuse to be mean tho, he\'d find something else if she had them). So.. He\'s not trying to he helpful, he\'s just reminding her of how ""badly"" she\'s performed. \nIt\'s her first mission, so she was very nervous and serious all the time (as seen in the previous page), she really wanted to impress his dad there, do perfect, and earn his approval. She\'s still to realise her self worth is not tied to B\'s opinion and that he\'ll not start seeing how truly good she is until... He decides to. \nI  hope this explained the situation and the intent a little better  their relationship will be clearer to the readers as the story evolves.\n\n\n\narleedraws:\nSomething else that doesn\'t sell the kidnapping scene for me: they\'re kidnapping a kid in broad daylight, at an open park, with cars in the background?\nYeah I should\'ve handled the scene a lot better c\': Like, there\'s reason behind that, but it\'s still not the best course of action and it def looks clumsy x\'D\nThe bad guys TM have been watching Arckan for a while now, they\'ve been investigating to make sure everything went alright. In the first interlude we\'ll see they have pics of Arckan in that same park They know for certain that during that time of the day no one\'s around that zone (as Arckan mentioned). But, still, the readers don\'t know all that and it\'s still kinda poor x\'D I\'ll try to do better in the future.\n\n\narleedraws:\nChapter 2 Page 12 - Arckan\'s shoulders spike up as if it\'s a comedy scene\nI hadn\'t thought about this, but you\'re very right here, I should revisit the page and modify his shoulders, because it does look kinda weird in such a scene. I guess I have anime too internalized in my veins by now x\'D\n\n\narleedraws:\nInstead you can heighten the drama with exaggerated shadows and creepy angles:\nI\'m saving this as well for future reference <333 There\'s so much potential everywhere. Next chapter will have a ton of talking, so this will come in especially handy (same for the other examples you give me later for the camera angles :D)\n\n\narleedraws:\nI feel like the eye-nose region could simply be shifted down and that would give their faces more balance\nHmmm I really should do more real life drawing excercises to fix stuff like this (and a whole lot of other stuff). In Arckan\'s case I don\'t think it\'s too bad, but A looks weird as frick in that panel x\'D The goal was for the camera to be kinda low there, buuuuut it looks awkward. I\'ll keep your advice in mind <3\n\n\narleedraws:\nArckan doesn’t age much in his appearance in the 6 year jump,\nI wouldn\'t place this in the nitpick stuff tbh, this is one of the bigges mistakes I consider I\'ve done c\': heights and portraying characters\' ages have always given me a lot of trouble, and it really really shows here. He\'s supposed to have a big growth spurt in the next year or so, buuuut that\'s no excuse for how little he\'s changed in the timeskip hahaha. I doubt I\'ll fix that, because that\'d require quite a lot of editing but I\'ll try harder to fix his height in the next pages (emphasis on try, I\'m still horrible at it x\'D).\n\n\narleedraws:\nwhen Arckan’s getting restrained in the van, the thug saying ""shut the fuck up"" kinda threw me for a loop only because of your cuter anime style\nI have a big trouble with this. B... Curses like a sailor. Seriously. It doesn\'t bother me at all when planing the story and dialogues, nor it does to my betas (aka: my friend and gf x\'D), because- or so I think- in Spanish it doesn\'t sound as bad. I wouldn\'t be too surprised to see someone saying the translation of ""Shut the f* up"" in Spanish at all, but, for what I\'ve seen, in English it\'s not the same. \nI\'ll change the dialogue for hell, if that sounds better  (I really had no idea hell was more acceptable than fuck - if you have some advice you consider important in that aspect please tell me because I sure have no idea here x\'D). And, for the next dialogues... I\'ll think about it. I wouldn\'t like to disturb anyone, but I don\'t want to change B\'s character too much. \nAlso, should I add a trigger warning for foul language? \nNooooww I think I covered it all. I can allow myself a last thank you, it was of great help reading this <3 there\'s a lot of stuff I have to improve and reading something like this helps me focus my attention where it\'s more due. \nAlso don\'t worry about taking long, this time of the year has that downside x\'D hope you had a nice christmas <3\nEdit: Woah this got long asfjklsaf so sorry about that I can\'t help but to ramble a bit when talking about this ', 'whoa, i hope you continue doing reviews cause this looks very helpful OAO', 'Hey loved reading your response and happy to see what you take from my thoughts and what you personally stick with  A word on cover art: I\'m doing it per chapter and I\'m DYING lol. It literally leaves me with no other time for other art besides my comic. So... truthfully I couldn\'t even recommend doing it. I just think you\'d want to make that first page a person sees really pop, and with your color and style it\'d be great if you showed off what you can do.\nHm, for sketchup I don\'t have any tutorials, I just jumped into it and it\'s Hell but I really gotta look into it myself... One webtoon artist I follow mentioned she uses the Sims games as reference for rooms and I thought that was fecking brilliant lol.And yes.... TALKING SCENES. Holy SHIT have I had to try to explore every possible angle to keep my scenes somewhat interesting lmao. Another good trick is just zooming in on the hands or a piece of the background (saves from drawing character burnout... which I\'m currently experiencing). For the foul language, in English, ""fuck"" is a much more severe word than ""hell."" You might hear ""hell"" in a kid\'s movie, but NEVER the F-word. Again that was a nitpick so it really only depends if you want to cater to a more mature audience with giving B a potty-mouth lol (he\'s pretty funny too).', ""Nice <3 then... I'll add a book cover of sorts to the first chapter, look up SketchUp (or the Sims lmao, doesn't sound half bad), try not to perish drawing the next chapter (it's... A and arckan talking. A lot x'D and doing doctor stuff, but yeah, no action) and avoid using fuck as much as I can (I had no idea it was such a bad word ahkdkg). \nThanks and good luck with the next reviews!<33"", ""Please let me know if/when you're open for new reviews."", 'I\'m back after literal MONTHS. I\'m sorry and there\'s only my procrastinating ass to blame So today I\'ll tackle @Hexigate \'s fantasy comic, Aegis. It\'s going to be an art-heavy review of sorts.\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nAegis | Tapas\nSamrose Reese is a newly-promoted detective of Aegis, the international law enforcement organization of the mythical world of Mylur. He sets off to complete his preliminary assignment: Find and retrieve another agent who\'s gone missing. He soon...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage.png679x868 608 KB\nI\'ll start with showing off this recent badass cover art.\n\nSince Aegis has been produced since 2015 (I\'m literally praying I\'ll make it that long with my own lol), we\'re going to mainly focus on the last 6 months or so of updates.\nFirst off, I love your disclaimer. (For those just reading the review, Aegis\' first page has a note saying it was crafted over years, so there\'s a lot of improvement to see from first to last page). It made me personally just want to read it because I wanted to see the changes (in fact it made me check your latest update at the time and there was a definite upgrade in storytelling/art quality).\nRight from the beginning, your pacing is excellent and the time you take to show the world is hard to find from most comics. I love it. Even as I know your art improves over time, I\'m already invested in how well the dialogue is presented and written, and the pacing of it all. Like seriously, you clearly put so much thought into secondary actions characters do as they talk. One point early on, our main character Sam, a detective, talks to a bartender, and the bartender is serving and setting up drinks as he talks. I just see a lot of comics neglecting they can have their characters do unrelated things as they talk to create more interest in the scene, so well done.\nThe sore spot in the very beginning is the art but it does improve greatly, so we\'ll be getting in-depth with it.\nSince I last checked in a couple months ago I\'m slapped in the face with how the quality has improved, lol. It\'s like everything I wanted to post, you telepathically knew and worked on. Namely controlling your sketchy lines (they feel so confident and clean and mesh very well with your half-painterly approach. See what I wrote almost 4 months ago below:\n""You have to learn to control your hairy lines. what saves your art is your confidence in shading. It really makes those pages jump out at me with your confidence in lighting scenes. I really think you need more gutters in between panels. Especially where panels are very dark, it starts being difficult to tell them apart. If you read some other webcomics a popular choice is a basic white background for all panels, but maybe for you a dark color/tone would suit it best.""\nBoth issues are resolved now. Lineart feels clean and confident and the use of gutters helps the panels breathe. So... you beat me to it @Hexigate  Below is an example for readers:\nCompare this: To this: \nimage.png518x640 326 KB\nYour panels have this overall professional finish to them now which looks great.\n\nI\'m randomly throwing this in, but you mentioned something in one of your updates that caught my eye:\n""Art-wise, I\'m stressing over my lack of development (as always). I need to learn to refine details in light and dark, I need to look into light scattering and reflected light, I need to differentiate flat and curved surfaces, I need to study hair and textures, I need to continue on anatomy, I need to understand body movement, and for goodness\' sake I need to innovate with my cinematography. I wish I had someone to help me with all of this, I could be advancing so much faster if I\'m classically trained. College won\'t let me take art courses and I don\'t have the funds to sign onto a studio; I\'m having a hard time teaching myself..."" (late 2018)\nI\'m a college art grad and I\'m here to say... art school doesn\'t do a lot for you unless you REALLY put in the effort. Grading is pretty subjective. It\'s insanely expensive. But I\'ll say the biggest improvement for me came in my life drawing/painting classes. And there are so many free resources online, it might be overwhelming, but the way I\'ve seen you improve shows you do pay attention to references, lighting, composition. Maybe you can add more structure to your study schedule by following some youtube channels that do online courses. There are many youtube channels that encourage daily studies. One of my favs is croquis cafe (nsfw warning, lots of nudies lol). They used to post weekly I think, 30 min long videos to practice alongside. So even if you can fit 20-30 min of targeted practice into your life, you\'ll see a wicked big improvement.\n\nyoutube.com\n\n\n\nCroquisCafe\nOn Air Video, Inc. is a video production company specializing in instructional videos for the fine arts and the arts & crafts. We are also the creators of th...\n\n\n\n\n\n(LINK ABOVE HAS NUDE MODELS YOU\'VE BEEN WARNED, lol)\nBut I feel you. There\'s nothing like taking a class and feeling the pressure to do your best. You could try starting something on the forums where a group of artists do specific studies weekly. Anything to make studying a responsibility, where you\'ll feel held accountable.\nAnd I mentioned it earlier, but your storytelling skills feel like second-nature to you. And how you compose your panels is really well done. You only use rectangular/square panels from what I\'ve seen but that doesn\'t take away ANYTHING from your storytelling. You take the time to establish the environment. You place characters in front of each other, or blur certain parts of a panel to bring in focus to one particular area. You\'ve got all that down, I just wanted to say.Here\'s an example of his attention to detail in panelling:\nimage.png354x869 231 KB\nThere are many more examples, but to go off on a tangent, many webcomics reuse panels or parts of panels to either build drama, create a comedic scene, or add buffer to the update\'s length. It\'s obvious to me when the artist didn\'t have time/didn\'t want to create more panels and reused the same one 2,3,4 times and that can end up looking lazy. It can be hard to make it look natural. But in this scene each panel has its own purpose. The blur guides our focus to what\'s important. And the subtle change of expression in the last two pa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
els makes the reused scene feel perfectly in place.\nOK ANOTHER TANGENT: Your comic never feels rushed. I think that\'s mostly a good thing. The only way it takes away from the story is how slow the story progresses. BUT since I read 4 years\' worth of work in like 2 hours, the pacing feels deliberate. Slow, but easy to digest. You don\'t info dump often and instead world-build over time, through snippets of dialogue.\n\nStudies:\nI\'d say your main focus of improvement will be in human anatomy, and faces.You do wonderfully already in conveying particular expressions very subtly. Here were a couple I really liked:\nimage.png637x534 219 KB\n \nimage.png804x506 193 KB\n\nAnd I love how expressive you\'ve made Sam. His personality shines through in his sorta laid-back personality, but he\'s still rational, brave, and level-headed. And he LOOKS it. Another: \nimage.png844x564 363 KB\n(btw I loved the shading/lighting in these scenes.)\n You just need some work on the forms themselves and start understanding faces on a deeper level than symbols. I\'d recommend studying real faces as well as redrawing faces/styles you like from comics/other artists. People say not to draw from other anime/comics at first and that\'s another debate. But if you only ever study realism there won\'t be an easy way to connect to your own style,,,," but I like how this person draws hands...."""" That kind of studying will get you closer to your own stylization", rather than just doing real-life studies only (and it\'s more fun lol).\nSo I\'d say look for your own inspiration in comics and media and do studies of those. Life studies of course always help but I think to streamline your improvement you should study media that inspires you and showcases the style you want to create.\nI don\'t know your own inspirations your comic takes a very mature tone from its pacing to the dialogue," and the content itself. This is a random pull but I feel you have a similar vibe to Naoki Urasawa\'s Monster (it\'s a highly narrative pacing with sudden moments of tension and action). Urasawa is an absolute art beast there\'s a lovely simple sylization to his art you might be interested in. I feel like the way he stylizes faces could be good to study too (it\'s pretty """"anime"""" so no worries if it ain\'t your thing):\nimage.png537x798 265 KB\n\n\nScenes that break suspension of disbelief:This I think is one of your weakest sequences in Aegis and I bring it up because it broke my suspension of disbelief big time.\nimage.png492x1933 609 KB\n\nAnd for those not familiar with the term", it means to not let certain things about a story/world affect your ability to enjoy the content. For example, I know magic isn\'t real but Harry Potter builds up a seemingly plausible world and explanation for how magic is hidden from most non-magic people. Never is there a point I\'m brought out of (say," the first) film because I\'m able to accept that world as """"true"""".\nFor art I might explain this phenomenon a little differently; it\'s probably more visual. If a story requires all the characters to be horseback riders but the artist doesn\'t ever draw horses", but draws everything else competently, their horses are going to stick out like a sore thumb and you\'ll be noticing their arts\' weak spots rather than staying hooked to the story.\nIn this scene the main character gets beaten to a literal bloody pulp, but it ends up looking like a gag strip. I still personally felt emotional weight because you have written Sam so relatably and well. But what makes the disconnect even bigger is your attention to detail in the blood, the bruising, and the overall dark and realistic colors and atmosphere. It doesn\'t mesh at all.\n...Looking over the first panel now, I think the first time he\'s punched is pretty well executed. But what also kind of throws me off is the static camera angle that doesn\'t work for the intensity of the scene.\nYour comic has a pretty mature narrative, and I feel it\'s really important you try to show that through the way you draw your human characters. Because as it stands now, your mature storytelling style with your art style rub up against each other noticeably.\n\nStudying from Art Styles:\nYou already set up really great atmospheres and lighting in the backgrounds. Only thing I\'d say for those is careful of your darker panels. For example, if you look at that strip where Sam gets beaten up, I actually upped the contrast and brightness. That whole scene in the comic was really dark, made it hard to see what was going on. (I\'m pretty sure that whole scene is way older than 6 months but I just wanted to mention)\nBumping up the contrast like this screenshot: \nimage.png733x312 211 KB\neven though this scene is clearly nighttime, there\'s plenty of contrast so i know exactly the expression/what\'s going on. (fwiw it\'s just that warehouse scene with Sam chasing down Verdana that stuck out to me. Other dark scenes I recall you handled well)\n\nSam:\nBelow I drew over Sam\'s face in a panel to show a way to add more real structure to his face. This might not be the way you want to do it, but it would help elevate the way he\'s viewed in the comic itself. I was thinking about it, and he feels so much like a 2D character in a world that really FEELS 3D. The anthro characters have form and shapes, the world itself is carefully designed and shaded, but Sam\'s whole presence feels pasted into the world like a paper figure. \nimage.png723x466 466 KB\nHere I just added more structure to his jaw, a little more form to the eye, a defined nose, lifted his hairline (feels like I\'m a plastic surgeon lol) and a stylized ear. Even without touching the hair (that I personally think you should study and add real structure to as well) he\'s gone from symbols to a person that\'s grounded in the world that surrounds him.\nNot only does Sam\'s face stand out, but his whole body, down to his hands and hair, should be more carefully drawn after some studies. He often looks quite blocky:\nimage.png787x499 279 KB\nAnd this scene is REALLY interesting to me. Immediately I can tell the forms of Verdana very well, and the way you lay her tail to the side is just beautiful. Sam looks like a potato! Sure he\'s got a baggy detective coat, but his sleeves are tubes, his weight isn\'t shifted to the right or left to give him a more relaxed pose. Again you use symbols of what a coat is, symbols of eyes, and hair, ect to describe Sam. And it just makes him look like a cutout compared to everyone else. (And I get this is a far shot, but up close he still feels flat)\n--Redesigns:In recent updates you mention changing how you portray two races of aliens, wanting to give them an upgrade to the mainly anthro style you were drawing before. \nimage.png760x668 174 KB\n\nThis is how the character Verdana looked before: \nimage.png639x863 430 KB\nAnd how she looks now: I don\'t think redesigns like this break a comic but I do have to say its jarring going into the new pages. First we were introduced to aliens that were very furry (which... honestly worked for me. They\'re distinctly different from humans so I didn\'t mind it). I like your new designs, but one issue I have with them is it\'s hard to tell their emotions. That being said we haven\'t had Verdana being super emotional since we\'ve seen her new design.\nSo while your previous anthro designs were pretty standard for anthro, there was so much expressiveness and emotion in their faces. These new designs feel pretty devoid," I guess pretty """"alien""""", but maybe if you can push their emotions more that\'d be good! \n\nRandom Thought:⦁\tWhile the main character Sam is my favorite, he feels like an old-school Columbo-esque detective, and he\'s the one guy that doesn\'t really fit in with the fantasy setting. every other character is anthro or if they\'re human," have some special garb or fantasy attire. I feel like if you changed up his outfit to give him more of that feeling he\'d fit into the world better. Just changing up his stereotypical detective coat/badge with different silhouettes would help. These decisions in his design further make him feel like a """"symbol"""" of a detective", not a real-looking character.\n\nI\'ll say this lastly, from my own experience. Drawing a comic makes you better at making a comic. It won\'t make you better at art (maybe somewhat but not unless you\'re pulling up references and actively learning through them. If you\'re drawing in a void (no reference, just straight drawing), the art won\'t change as noticeably. Working on a comic will improve your output speed, maybe pacing and storytelling if you\'re reading others\' comics and reading up on comic-making. But it won\'t make your art better. So for you personally I\'d just start up a sketchbook of studies, focusing on human anatomy. While also studying artists you personally enjoy. Once you get that going you just start gradually introducing what you learn into your characters just like you did with the backgrounds/lighting/lineart. Your own improvement is apparent and you know how to apply new concepts you\'ve learned to your comic. I would just love to see that level of care and attention into the human characters, as complex and daunting as it may seem. \nAnd just like you improved on lineart/shading/ect... Don\'t feel pressured to completely study everything on the human body. It can start with just a feature on the face, or many you want to do a handful of coat studies to better understand how fabric lays on a person wearing it. And slowly implement what you\'ve learned over time. I didn\'t feel I could give a lot of specific instruction on what to study because you need to study everything that goes into drawing people. So do it at your own pace, and pick and choose what you\'ll study for 30min/an hour. And things will start to come together. You are a talented storyteller and I don\'t think I needed to tell you what I recommend you do, maybe you just needed to hear it from an outside source, as we all do. \nThanks again @Hexigate for being patient with my procrastinating ass  I wish you luck with continuing Aegis and I\'ll be waiting for more!\n@Rhonder You\'re up next. I promise not to dip for 10 more years, and thank you for your continued patience!!', 'Thank you so much! I think this review will help me a ton. I\'m really happy that you took your position and knowledge as an art grad and tackled the art in this comic; lord knows I need the help. I hope you don\'t mind me responding to some of your more critical points.\n\nYour link to CroquisCafe is a valuable resource that I will fully exploit like a greedy businessman.\nYour point about the breaking of your suspension of disbelief and that scene resonates with me. Before your review, I didn\'t know what it was, but every time I came back to that scene I found myself scrolling past it fast. It wasn\'t the repulsion from violence," I drew the thing; It just didn\'t sit right. I agree with your point that the """"uncut"""" nature of the scene shows the flaws in the artwork in a really stark fashion.\nI wholeheartedly agree with your observations on darkly-lit scenes. I\'m just bad at lighting faces in particular. I like to think I\'d do much better today", with what I\'ve learned and studied.\nPushing the emotions through these new alien designs is something I\'ve been putting my attention to ever since I introduced them. I understand your point about these alien faces being less expressive, though I have heard conflicting feedback regarding this. (Your comment about it is actually a first, other readers have found the aliens\' expressions coming through clearly.)\nI lament giving Sam his current outfit. The plan when I first started the story was that Sam acts as an anchor for readers when they\'re going into this strange fictional world. It was intended that Sam stand out as being...Normal. But now it just feels like Sam is following a cliche, stereotypical beige trench coat and all. I plan to address this poor fashion choice later on.\nI used to think that working on my comic has made me better at art, and I think it has to some degree. I\'m very unmotivated when it comes to general studies, so maybe practicing these things through a narrative is my way of dealing with this. But I noticed that working on this comic hasn\'t made me very better with human anatomy; most of the improvement came from my (rather lacking) studies. And this comic--and by proxy its style--has completely consumed my artistic life. Drawing humans in the way they\'re drawn in the comic is now my natural state, and I don\'t think I like that because of its glaring flaws.I\'ve read someone\'s comments a few weeks back about how they\'re now struggling to embrace or try any other art styles because they\'ve been working on their comic and only their comic for so long; it\'s become something they can\'t break out of. I don\'t think I want to fall into that same trap, and I should continue to study, experiment, and progress beyond my current state. Your review has been a wake up call for me to realize that and get moving.\n\nAgain, thank you so much. I can\'t tell if you\'d recommend this to a friend or not, but it\'s been helpful regardless. I\'ll try my best to follow your advice and continue to develop, not becoming complacent with the present.

But when a mysterious thief steals the town\'s most important treasure, it\'s up to Alex (local water mage) & friends to retrieve it! Can they hunt the treasure...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo give any readers a recap if they haven\'t read this comic here\'s the synopsis:\nBeing a water mage in a dry climate is like being a fish out of water. But when a mysterious thief steals the town\'s most important treasure, it\'s up to Alex (local water mage) & friends to retrieve it! Can they hunt the treasure down, or will the thief make a clean escape!?\nAnd to keep the review as legible as possible, whenever I put this (^) or (v) this symbol references which image I\'m talking about.\nWith that being said, let\'s start with the cover art: \nimage.png556x860 333 KB\nI love the dynamic energies of the characters in this. They have an excellent diagonal line with the one character breaking that line off to the right side. However the weakest element is the lack of a background. For a story called TreasureHUNT I would love to see fantasical worlds, bountiful treasures, something world building in this to enhance the title and hook us in. And these environments do exist in the comic so this would be a great place to highlight them.\nEspecially after reading this comic entirely, I feel having the characters surrounded by runes/weather runes, or relevant locations in the comic," would have helped set the tone.\nThe Comic\nThe way I\'m reviewing this will be a little different. I\'m essentially going through every other page and commenting specific things that catch my eye. The comic is 70 pages and a well-rounded story so I focus mainly on art and panelling.\n\nimage.png578x860 212 KB\n(^) In the first page we\'re thrown into the middle of some action which is very nice. Wonderful touch mixing the sound fx with the scenery with the """"sploosh"""". One thing on a page like this is to carefully highlight those lower panels. The dark tones blend in with the rest of the upper scene", making them hard to distinguish. Other than that I love the color choice and atmosphere you crafted. (^) Page 4: Nitpicky but the action lines of the fire monster in the first panel implies he is falling, but in the second panel he is in the air. It read to me as a continuity error but reading again it could just be the blob bouncing towards Alex. An easy fix would be to swap the actions or use different camera angles so the blob doesn\'t appear from the same angle in both panels. I love the art overlapping the panels to bring the scene to life.\n\nimage.png493x511 260 KB\n(^) Page 4: In the top half of the page there is no dynamic movement here implying Rod (our main character\'s friend, the leggy guy) is going to kick the blob. Looks totally static and reads flat. The middle panel however has great dynamics and you take advantage of diagonals in the leg, water, fx, and panel underneath. Good stuff. \nHowever, having read through the entire comic a couple times I noticed a few times you use this triple-panel setup (top of the page) that takes away the action of the scene, but I\'ll touch on that later. \n\nimage.png503x661 276 KB\n(^) Switching gears to talk about the world itself: I love the concept of mana and water (there are mana affinities tied to natural resources).\nQuick Thoughts about Main Characters:\nTo summarize our main character Alex\'s motivations, he dreams of going to a magic university but it costs a lot of gold to enter. He wants to improve his magic, so his team can take on bigger jobs and earn more money. \nimage.png499x543 225 KB\n(^)Rod seems like a genuinely chill and supportive guy. Like a good role model for Alex. Random observation but I really like him lol.\nOur villain enters:\n\nimage.png498x746 282 KB\n-- A little later...(^)Page 20: Ok," you got me. In this page this evil chick is confronted by two guards that are protecting the town\'s water rune (a precious resource). I was fully expecting a brawl with this chick and these two imposing guards but I love that you introduce one of her skills (telepathy to pick up items) and she just knocks them out. Not expecting her to just brush them off and it got a good chuckle from me!\n\nimage.png534x631 192 KB\n(^) Page 22-23: """"While we were conked out!"""" I giggled at this"," I think a better word could be """"while we were knocked/passed out!"""" Conked out feels like it\'s meant to be a funny line. This is probably nitpicky but which words you use can establish or shift the tone of your story and I don\'t think this comedic effect was intentional (there\'s high stakes in this scene since the town needs the water rune).\nI also love the dynamic angles of each character speaking! But I think the brown background is muddy and unappealing. Even adding a couple blurred out details in different tones/colors would break this up. I think when you do backgrounds they look excellent in the story", and there\'s no  need to do them every panel. Just being mindful to keep each page interesting/engaging is something to remember.\nThoughts on Background Art/Quick Tricks\nThese next tips aren\'t necessarily aimed to you but I thought I\'d share some examples of adding flair to backgrounds, especially ones like above where you want to highlight a character without spending too much time in the background. Also these are easier/faster techniques for backgrounds rather than drawing them out entirely.1. - 3D models (you have to be careful though; I\'ve seen too many artists use 3D models and not color-correct/paint over them a bit, and their art compared to the background sticks out like a sore thumb. Below I have an example from the Webtoon Short Story comic Two of Cups by Pancat Yuz\'ki (https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/two-of-cups-b/list?title_no=441150). She uses background models but takes the time to light and recolor them. The result is clean, faster than drawing by hand, and adds depth to the comic. Even the slight blur of the furniture further away is a great touch. \nimage.png653x902 361 KB\n\nBlurring photos/color corrections: This one is tricky with more stylized art, but doable. I do this quite a bit with royalty-free photos (I hate drawing backgrounds so I blur the photo, paint over it a bit, and call it a day lol. Also 3D model car!):\nimage.png960x1142 710 KB\n\n\nFor you personally, you handle backgrounds on your own which helps you stand out. I love the look of hand-drawn backgrounds, but it\'s up to you and what the art style calls for, how much time you want to invest in them...\n(^) Page 27: Moving on, the top panel is really nice with that background! I love the flow of the dialogue bubbles! And the exposition from the mayor feels really natural alongside his standing in front of visual explanations. I\'ve struggled to figure this out myself, but in moments of thick dialogue/exposition," having different types of imagery can help visually space out a comic as well as keep the page interesting.\n(^) Page 28: I love little panels like the second one (mayor holding the watch). In my personal experience it\'s taken a while to realize the characters do not need to be center stage every panel. When focusing the """"camera"""" on different subjects (ex: the landscape the character is looking at", their hands, over their shoulder) it adds great depth to the comic.\nDrawing the mayor apprehensively looking at his watch as he explains the mana trail won\'t last very long is an excellent example. Also, the first panel is a great concept but it is really hard to see the mana trail Alex is talking about. If perhaps more of the window took over the panel, or you split this panel up into two panels (one panel of Alex looking out the window, second of the window and a clear view of the mana trail) because on mobile viewing especially it\'s very small.\nConsidering your comic for a Mobile Format\nAnd on the topic of mobile vs desktop viewing, the comics world has shifted dramatically to mobile reading. Luckily your comic works really well even as a traditional format comic on mobile (I\'ve read it both on a computer/phone) because you keep the text larger and legible. I\'m not saying you need to try a long-format comic but it can open a lot of doors to some exciting panelling and fully takes advantage for a mobile format! \nimage.png608x807 396 KB\n(^) Love the little exposition of what the weather rune can be used for (fair weather at sea, if sold at the right price!) Helps to build up the value of the item the characters are pursuing. And again using art that fleshes out the world, like the characters imagining other shady figures in the world, is a nice touch instead of having them just discussing it.\n(^) Rudolph was already introduced, so why do it again? I find introducing characters best goes as the group/couple converse apart from the new character. For example, Rudolph could quietly watch Dylan piss off Rod, and Rod could say," """"Are you TRYING TO GET PUNCHED"," Dylan??"""" But I\'m rambling. I think the three main characters can absolutely reintroduce themselves to Rudolph but not to us", the viewers. The characters suddenly stopping and reintroducing themselves feels unnatural, as a reader. Weaving it in the story would help it flow better.\n\nimage.png758x313 127 KB\n(^) But Alex\'s reintroduction is super cute. I like his how much of a rookie he is, but has endless optimism, makes for an automatically likeable character.\n\nimage.png741x612 337 KB\n(^)Page 34: I know I\'m jumping around the comic a lot, but I liked this scene. The villain we previously met has mind control powers that only work on people susceptible to it. Rudolph and Alex are immune because they use more magic than the others. Alex deduces it\'s charm magic and that magic-users are usually immune to it. Just as I asked myself that as a reader, Alex figures it out, which was a natural way for us to understand how magic works in this world.\nimage.png523x756 263 KB\n(^)Page 38: Love the flow of this page. Clear storytelling and the use of visual examples to their powers alongside the dialogue. In this scene the villain has sealed the heroes into a cave with a giant boulder. We\'re walked through the dilemma and shown multiple possibilities of escape from this cave, while also showing the character\'s limitations even with magic. \nimage.png581x819 437 KB\n(^)Page 41: I love the solution to their issue with the boulder! (For context, the characters use fire and water to weaken a boulder in their path, and another breaks through the rock) But this page is difficult to read from the fuzzy background and the very dark panel at the bottom. You\'re going for realistic lighting on Panda, which I usually would like, but here it would make this full-page more dramatic to exaggerate the fire and light the character with that, even if it\'s a little unrealistic or over the top. \nimage.png579x850 411 KB\n(^)Page 42: At the top you use three same-sized panels, which robs the scene from any action (it\'s also very difficult to see the panels). This is the big escape from the cave, so maybe Panda could have burst through the rock on one page, pebbles flying across the scene. I also love the bottom panel, it feels triumphant and I think it would have been even better as a single page.\nDynamic Panelling Examples:\nBelow I\'ll show a couple of examples from some the Naruto and Bleach manga (I\'m sorry my knowledge of action manga is basic haha)\nimage.png646x1000 350 KB\nI\'ve seen comics do even crazier things with their panelling, but I always liked how these two manga can create movement through sometimes pretty simple panelling. The trick is in mixing up angles, making use of action lines, even overlapping effects and onomatopoeias throughout the page. You do a lot of this already and I think it can still be pushed.\n \nimage.png1000x791 580 KB\n(^) In these pages of Naruto, the left page features fairly simple panelling but there\'s movement, tons of implied action lines, varied panel sizes, ect... all coming together to make a really engaging page.\nI would love to see you push really dynamic panelling or mixing up the angles of the characters and perspectives. I also think when you zoom out for these moments of action I\'m not attached to the movements of the character. It feels like I\'m a passive spectator at a sports event. I want to be up close with the protagonists and villains with some crazy perspective scenes and extreme close-ups. It\'s nice to see as the comic progresses you start to experiment with all this: \nimage.png579x850 387 KB\n(^) I LOVE this panel. Your full-page spreads are very well-composed and usually show the world in an interesting/creative way. I think your lines are a little shaky and it stands out more in architectural scenes like this. You could achieve a lot of polish by using guidelines/perspective rulers, drawing the shapes of the buildings more proportionally, then going back and adding in imperfections. But I really like that you hand-draw all your scenes and I think you should keep rolling with that.\nimage.png484x675 509 KB\n(^) As I\'m rereading again, I remembered this incredible page. This is probably my favorite in the entire comic: everything I brought up previously is handled great here. There\'s panels that bleed into each other, magic colors that weave all over (event though its chaotic I think it\'s exciting). There\'s close-ups and then the bottom scene showing the entire cave filled with magic.\nimage.png607x825 505 KB\n(^) Last page I\'ll cover, theres a considerable improvement over every aspect of the comic over the year. This is one of the last pages and the colors use a warm afternoon glow. It ties all the panels together and I think the dialogue bubbles read smoothly. \nSome nitpicks:\nCharacter design: Tonally the character designs feel very random. It feels slightly quirky and anime-inspired. I guess mainly Dylan\'s (the Panda hoodie) outfit throws me for a loop after seeing the town\'s guards in medieval armor. If this was chalked up to the story taking place in an actual MMO, where there\'s tons of variety in gear, that would make a little more sense (it has elements of an MMORPG). However I would write this off as just a nitpick because these characters are fun to watch interact and it really didn\'t bother me too much.\nFinal Notes:\nYour storytelling skills are really solid and panels flow very naturally between each other most of the time. There are some weaker panelling moments but they\'re mostly balanced out with some really unique angles and distinct backgrounds (backgrounds are something a lot of artists are anxious to do, myself included, so definitely keep pushing that).\nYou\'re also a good writer. The dialogue flows naturally out of your characters and I don\'t think I was ever tripped up about the story at any point or felt like the dialogue was stilted.\nI checked out your profile and saw you reformatted TreasureHUNT to a vertical format! It looks so good! And on my phone each panel can really pop, so now that I\'ve seen you\'re interested in experimenting with vertical I say go all out and really push some crazy panels. Like the scene of the villain hopping around on rooftops, that would look incredible in vertical!\nAlso, I think it\'s worth mentioning this comic is completed (season end), which says to me you planned this from beginning to end. Even if some things changed along the way, the story rounded out really nicely and felt long enough to be a journey with these characters. Overall great job as a completed work and I\'d be curious to see what you\'ll do next with these characters!\n--Since it\'s been so long since I promised to get this review out I think it\'s safe to say I\'m not best at getting these out in a timely manner. But I just want to thank @AbelDraws @Hexigate and @Rhonder for letting me try reviewing out, and I hope whoever actually takes the time to read these TL;DR\'s (lol) can hopefully take some ideas and inspiration from them!', 'Thank you so much for the review! Even though it took a while, I think it was worth the wait  \nI think your analysis was pretty spot on point for point and pretty much all of these things I\'m hoping to improve in my future work! Especially things like the poor lighting in some scenes and muddy/oversaturated background (and character, tbh) colors!\n\n\narleedraws:\nHowever, having read through the entire comic a couple times I noticed a few times you use this triple-panel setup (top of the page) that takes away the action of the scene\nI\'m really glad that you touched on this because this is something I haven\'t really heard anyone talk about yet when looking at my work, but I totally see what you mean! The examples given for how to use more dynamic angles and zoom were helpful too and I\'ll definitely try to pay more mind to that  \n\n\narleedraws:\nThoughts on Background Art/Quick Tricks\n\n\narleedraws:\nI think your lines are a little shaky and it stands out more in architectural scenes like this. You could achieve a lot of polish by using guidelines/perspective rulers, drawing the shapes of the buildings more proportionally, then going back and adding in imperfections. But I really like that you hand-draw all your scenes and I think you should keep rolling with that.\nCombining these two lines from different parts of the review since they go together, more or less! Big agree- I\'m more or less committed to hand drawing my backgrounds because I just... vastly prefer the way that art style shines through when hand drafting background elements (vs. even using a 3D model as a base) BUT I absolutely agree that the line quality throughout this comic is not very good (for both the characters and backgrounds, but it definitely shows through the worst in the city scenes ). \nPart of it is I just never achieved mastery over my inking tools... I decided to pick up and try to learn dip pen for the first time while making this comic and ended up hitting the learning curve head on, from smudging ink while trying to use rulers, to never quite grasping how to get the line weights and fluctuation quite how I liked them. The other part is in regards to perspective guides... I never have quite figured out a good way to get the vanishing points far enough off the page for 2 and 3 point perspective while drawing traditionally, so a lot of my would-be cooler scenes have a lot of perspective issues @u@;; \nOne thing that I started moving towards last year and have fully embraced this year is mostly drawing digitally in full (and not just for the coloring like this comic). It\'s sooooooooo satisfying to just... put the perspective points where I need them without worrying about how much desk space I have or how long of a ruler I need LOL I think the perspective on my backgrounds at the very least have gotten a lot better xD But also tools to achieve straight lines, and the like.\n\n\narleedraws:\nConsidering your comic for a Mobile Format\n\n\narleedraws:\nI checked out your profile and saw you reformatted TreasureHUNT to a vertical format! It looks so good! And on my phone each panel can really pop, so now that I\'ve seen you\'re interested in experimenting with vertical I say go all out and really push some crazy panels. Like the scene of the villain hopping around on rooftops," that would look incredible in vertical!\nBig agree! I only ended up doing the one episode of """"TreasureHUNT!! vertical"""" as a litmus test to see how chopping up traditional pages into vertical would go and I think it worked pretty well! I\'ll keep that in mind for the next page format comic I do... but my current project is actually just straight up vertical scroll so that\'s exciting  I feel like I have a long way to go to understand how to do interesting panel compositions in vertical (right now I mostly just play with spacing between panels... like short space = faster sequence", or more space between = longer/more dramatic) but I know there\'s a lot more to try out. In any case, I definitely think that\'s the way to go on these app-based platforms, for sure.\n\n\narleedraws:\nOverall great job as a completed work and I\'d be curious to see what you\'ll do next with these characters!\nMany thanks! Indeed," these 70 pages were start to finish the entirety of the short story I wrote out in 2018 so I consider it complete now  There was originally a thought to continue the series on and do at least a """"Season 2""""", but alas after spending a few months on break/writing said 2nd season I eventually dropped the idea for the foreseeable future.

Using the other agents information about other heists Robin supposedly committed, Nick had written another program to analyze the footage for signs of Robin or her doppelgänger. There was nothing for him to do now but wait.\nHe logged into his online roleplaying game, Conquest of Angels, deciding to kill some time. A green icon blinked on. Nick smiled. Artemis was online.\nAn avatar of a Viking shieldmaiden appeared on the screen. The maiden’s wooden shield was marked with a cat’s paw print and the horns on her helmet sparkled like diamonds.\n“Hey Kaylee,” said Nick, referring to her real-life name. “New helmet?”\n “Of course.” Her avatar did a twirl. “I’m not a level 85 shieldmaiden for nothing. How are you doing, Nick? You’ve been MIA for a couple weeks now.”\n“Whatever,” he chuckled. Nick hadn’t had much time to play over the last few weeks. He had been helping Jamie catalogue a massive shipment of artifacts sent by the team in the Middle East. “It’s not like we haven’t been IM’ing or anything.”\n“You know what I mean,” said Kaylee, through his headset. “It’s not the same. I like actually talking with you while we bust up a goblin hoard.” He chuckled. He liked talking with Kaylee too. They had been friends for years. She knew all about his dad, Penelope, and the string of jobs he’d taken to support his gran and Auntie Florida. “How’s the new job been? Is it still as boring as it sounds?”\n“Wow,” he laughed. “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard you call IT boring.”\n“You’re doing IT for a friggin’ museum, Nicky,” Kaylee insisted. “What do you do all day? Teach old people how to Google?” There was a crash behind her. Nick could hear people shouting the background.\n“Kaylee…”\n“Hold on, Nick. I’m gonna…” \nKaylee took over her oversized-gaming headphones and padded down the hall to the main living area. She could hear her parents talking to each other in rapid Mandarin. Through their teary voices, Kaylee only caught a few words: no money; lose the store; what are we going to do?\n“Mama, Baba,” said Kaylee. “What’s going on?”\nHer father turned and looked at her. The side of his face was red. Tears welled up in her normally stoic father’s eyes. “Kaylee, go back to your room.”\n“No Kaylee,” said a man. He wore a dark suit that made his dark eyes appear like twin pools of ink. “Stay. I’m sure your parents would want you to know that they took out a loan they can’t repay.” The man looked back at her parents. “You have one week, Mr. and Mrs. Song, and then your store in mine.”\n\n“Kaylee!” The other end of the line was silent. Nick pounded on the keyboard, tracking her IP address. “Kaylee! What’s going on?”\nA few minutes later, Nick heard her whisper. “Nick?”\n“Oh my gosh, Kaylee. What happened? What’s going on?”\nKaylee sniffed. “They’re going to lose the store. It’s all they have.”\n“What’s all they have?” Nick’s voice softened. Kaylee took a steadying breath. “Kaylee, girl, please talk to me. Maybe I can help you out.” ""', '\n\ncherrystark:\n\nYou’re doing IT for a friggin’ museum, Nicky,” Kaylee insisted. “What do you do all day?

Through their teary voices, Kaylee only caught a few words: no money; lose the store; what are we going to do?\n\nThis POV transition is jarring, particularly because it also has a huge change in subject matter. One minute I am trying to keep up with Nick and his friendship with Kaylee, then out of the blue, Kaylee is talking to her parents. \nI would suggest a new chapter or at least a clear divide; or removing the scene with her parents and Kaylee simply saying to Nick, staying in Nick\'s POV... Hold on! Then he hears some subdued noise, maybe crying. ""What\'s going on?"" ""I iwll call you back, my parents are losing the store...""  THEN if the store is important and is not a sidedish for Nick-Kaylee relationship, start a new chapter with Kaylee\'s POV.\nStylistically, you have a lot of sentences with a Subject+Verb and barely anything else, like Nick/he chuckled (and you use it twice in a row), so it\'s still have a bit of a choppy feel, like here:\n \n\n\ncherrystark:\nHe logged into his online roleplaying game, Conquest of Angels, deciding to kill some time.

With that said, I am open to reading comics through I can't help you too much on the art critic side since my focus on story writing, not art. I only be reading  three chapters for novels and the first episodes for comics. You can ask if you want my review in your story or private message.  I'm allowing up to three slots to review since it's my first time doing something like this. This may extend at least up to five in the future.
Please note: I won't focus on grammar much on my reviews since it's my weak point that I also working on. Instead the review focus on things like plot pacing and things like that.
The only thing I will ask but won't pressure you is to read and comment my novel, but please check out:

306,New artist here - looking for advice/feedback on my first comic (“:,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, as it says in the title I'm a new user on this website and I picked up art as a hobby this year because of quarantine. (I used to draw before but not as a hobby... the last thing I drew before this year was a random Miku in 2017 lol)
Anyway, I am currently working on my first webcomic project and I'd appreciate any reviews, criticism, etc. regarding it! As I've never made a comic before, I know there is still a lot for me to learn. At the moment, it has four chapters and two animated music videos.
The story: BreadAVOTA is about a sentient doll named Bread, and all variations of the aforementioned in a quest to change her name to something less... um, that. In the nation of Maldevara, ""Living"" is a legal and not biological status and she must fulfill the Legal Requirements of the Living to have her name changed, and somewhere along the way gets dragged along by the celemarketer-slash-""supranatural researcher"" angel Charlotte into a conspiracy involving the Undead, cursed galleries, demon popstars and something about the radio.

Bread, and all variations of the aforementioned
A sentient doll named Bread, and all variations of the aforementioned tries to get the Court of the Living to recognize her as a Living Citizen so she can change her name, because Bread, and all variations of the aforementioned is a really silly...






The Webtoon version has some additional art and worldbuilding/lore stuff: not exactly necessary to understand the story so far but do feel free to check it out if it interests you (:
Some points to consider (feel free to ignore these, these are more guides of what I'd like to know)
Dialogue: This is my main priority: I'm diagnosed somewhere on the cluster A-schizophrenia spectrum so my speaking style comes off as quite stilted and rambly, and writing natural dialogue is difficult for me. Is the dialogue easy to follow and engaging? Or is it confusing and drags on too much? Also, do the characters have distinct ""voices"" or do they all sound same-y?
Art style: I know my consistency needs work and the characters go off-model, but besides that what else do you think should be improved in the art? Is the art style appealing and does it match the story's mood?
Besides those, let me know if there is anything else you feel needs improvement.
Thank you for your time <3","[""I'll take a look later when I have time. Looking forward to it. "", 'Thank you very much ', 'Nice work. Subbed.\nWelcome to Tapas. ', 'Thank you so much! ', ""Honestly, starting just this year with quality this high? You're more than set in some regards! The art, both character artwork and the comic itself, are great, the pacing feels very modern western show-like, and the character design is top notch. For note, I read only the Tapas version.\nWhen it comes to dialogue, it's kind of rambly, but it's still engaging and the characters come through nicely. The only problem I'd mention is that the lettering might get in the way of some of the longer dialogue sequences; some parts seem actually too small to read on mobile (I usually read on browser but the app is the biggest audience) since some text is very, very small; and also, it's usually not recommended to have hyphenation (separating syllables if the words don't fit the line), because it's very hard to read efficiently in comics.\nIn art, honestly, the off-model-ness of the work feels like its own identity to me. Everyone is always moving, acting, expressing, and even in the characters that don't have a supernatural justification to be fluid, it still feels part of the world. It's a niche on WT and Tapas, I won't beat around the bush(I can attest that it's an uphill battle if you're not easy to binge and your art isn't anime), but when your love for the world and characters just oozes out of the art like this, you'll find that you trade in quick numbers for very engaged fans.\nA few extra points:\n\nOn Tapas, avoid posting twice in the same day. It's best to have a schedule so you can regularly post pages, even if weekly or monthly, but you only display on Fresh every 24 hours, and it's where most of your views come from.\nThis is a very marketing kind of suggestion, so if you don't have the time feel free to disregard, but your cover really doesn't follow the main artstyle of the comic. The extreme shading and coloring in the pages is very unique, and your reader a) doesn't see it when they find your comic at first and b) they find something else entirely when your cover is very rendered and colorful, and might feel lied to. It's good art, but it's better on the character profiles or other places you might promote the comic at.\nFor the animations, if you're going to keep the episodes there when you post new ones, I recommend saving a gif of a few seconds of it to show it off, since Tapas allows you to post any that are under 2mb! Some people just ignore the description entirely so grabbing their attention with a preview is very effective.\n\nAnd, uh, off the top of my head, that's it! You've got some extremely strong work by itself, so best of luck getting it seen!"", 'Ah thank you so much for your extensive input, I will definitely keep your advice in mind (:', 'We already adore it! Subscribed/liked/hyped.  What a unique storyline, with very unique art and characters!', 'Thank you so much <3', 'So far the art looks quite amazing! If you want advice I would say to you,\n\nIs the title easy to remember?\nIs the pages too wordy or too small? \n\nMind you some people like this style of comics, and theres nothing wrong with that at all! Just keep in mind what audience your wanting to draw in and how your going to leave an impression. But the artstyle is nice keep up good work!', 'Thank you for your feedback!

It sometimes feels really slow and sometimes really fast. Secondly, the tone of your first and second chapter was very different. It might seem kinda off for me. The first chapter was really serious, but it became a really relaxed tone in the second chapter. If this is what your going for then don't listen to what I just said.

I would like you to give space. explain more with your art and talk less with words and if you feel the need for your character to speak more, create more scenes, short panels that will give you space to add text. I don\'t care for black and white. (this is a personal choice) however, since we are in at the point in time where color is taking over, you might want to consider color since it will help you capture more audience.

310,I will review the First Two Chapters of your series [Closed!],Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello. I would like to offer my services for reviewing the first two chapters of your stories. Two chapters only, simply because I imagine the general length of bigger stories I've seen so far and the time I have available probably wouldn't be able to mesh together.

I'll take six stories, first-come-first-serve. One story per user, though.
While I'm open to reviewing comics, please keep in mind that my main experience is in prose. I wouldn't be able to offer feedback on something like panel composition or critique the art beyond just my general impressions. If you're okay with that, go for it.
How you want me to review is up to you. If you want a simple, short, general impression, then I'll post it in the comments of your chapters. If you want something a bit more in-depth, I'll probably have to DM you.
It'll probably take a day or two to get back to you, if that's okay.

I'm not actually going to ask you to review my story in return. Instead, I ask that you merely read the first two chapters of it. If you like it, ya like it, if ya don't, ya don't. If you wanna leave a review/like/keep reading beyond that/whateverino, that's fine, but if you don't, that's fine, too. It's really just more about getting people to read the thing than anything. Either way, I'm not gonna ask for proof you read it or anything, but I would appreciate if you were honest about it.
The story itself is here:

I just uploaded a first chapter of my novel ( still a work in progress):https://tapas.io/series/Diaries-of-a-Fighter5Title: Diaries of a FighterGenre: thriller with supernatural elements/ romance/ it’s also a bit dark…Summary: A troubled, wanna-be professional MMA fighter ventures into the dark and occasionally bizarre world of Japanese fighting organisations to become the best fighter in the world. He encounters love, hate, brutality, some suspicious, other-worldly beings, and is faced with hard decisions. The life of a fighter is certainly not an easy one, but then again, nothing worth fighting for is easy.Chapters will be uploaded regularly, meanwhile I'd love to get some comments/reviews.Thank you!","['Hey, congo for the first publish! I checked out your novel a while ago. Given how your blurb and the first chapter focus on fights, how about you name your main genre as an action? Action, Fantasy, Romance/drama (if there are character conflicts) should be the right combination in my opinion. \nGood luck!', 'So, you only have one chapter. I agree with @Dysis above that Action will be a better first genre, because it seems to target people who want to read about fighting more than the people who\'d like a historic drama. \nYou have an emerging writing voice, with a solid grasp on grammar--that\'s good!  You are more of a tell than show. In my world, this is fine, because I am not enamored with modern obsession over showing everything in long annoying sentences as long as the narrator has an interesting delivery. He is a bit dry, however, so injecting invectives and emotions would help. \nYou are on Tapas, and Tapas wants short, clear chapters. My biggest suggestion is to rearrange the first chapter by cutting back on the background, but conveying that his only goal is to make it into this fancy Japanese fighting circle and smoothly lead it to the ending where he has to fight his first opponent. Try as much as possible to keep the events chronological, as jumping between memories and present is harder to read.\nThe 500-1K words chapter is a norm on Tapas and they often do better than 1-1.5K chapters. \nStart the next chapter with the ""So, here is my opponent"" and go from there. \nHope this helps.', ""Thank you for the comment!

Fantasy I'm not sure would be a right fit, but I can see about this later on as well.Thank you very much!"", ""Since you included supernatural as an element and Tapas doesn't specifically have that as a genre, I suppose it alright to include Fantasy instead, as a sub-genre, of course.

I see the shorter length is really preferable here in Tampas, so I'll take this suggestion (which was also mentioned by others) into account and break it into two chapters and then make sure to keep them shorter from now on.

The length of my work is exactly why I've asked in the forums: it'd be too long in a regular comment.\nPlus I don't think it'd hurt to see what other people (outside my readers) think as well!

I just went through the first three chapters (14 pages) of your comic. As a reader, I\'d like to share my opinions so far. \nThe art has a spooky vibe to it so it drew me in. It has great potential. The problem would be the content building. As I only understand English, I couldn\'t understand the other language that you wrote, so if it was the brother cursing his sister or vice versa, I couldn\'t get the humour behind it! It would be helpful if you can stick to only one language.\nIn case you are introducing a concept unfamiliar to a new reader, it would be helpful if you mention what it means with an asterisk under the panel. For instance, when you used <> and << >> in conversation, if you had added the meaning of those with a "" *<> means conversation is in English"" under the same comic panel, I would have understood immediately. It just makes the read more comfortable.\nI\'m confused about what kind of school she is in. How did she end up there? What is her situation exactly? Did her parents give her away? Did her and her brother commit some trouble to end up there? I\'m guessing you would reveal the information as the chapters progress but confusion is a very strong reason for a reader to shy away from your work!  If you could introduce the character\'s thoughts on this school, something like ""This is where I\'ve been stuck in. A nightmare,"" and then add information about her environment through her thoughts (e.g. ""These pills are for your good, they say. Ha!""; ""The teachers here don\'t teach, they dictate""; or ""Another word for dread? Prefects."") it would have been better. \nOn that context, I liked the pacing of those lines that you used at the beginning when she was about to eat the pill, the ones about a healthy body and a healthy mind. It builds up suspense as well as gives adequate information to help the readers understand what\'s actually going on.', ""Hey thank you SO much for taking the time to write this!

315,I’ll REVIEW your comic! I’ll do it!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi. I'm Kent, I draw BERET over here https://tapas.io/series/BERET41 and I'll review your comic, for fun!
As we're all trapped inside our houses, thought I might spend some time reviewing the comics of anyone who would like some feedback. 
I'll focus on the experience of your comic and story/presentation elements I think work and point out what may not be working. I tend to value flow and expression over conventional beauty and hard logic, but I'll read whatever!
I'm not gonna trash any comic, but do know that while feedback will kind, it will be feedback. I'll focus only on quality of the experience, not marketability or anything of that sort. ALSO I'm not gonna read more than like 50 pages of comic a pop here, unless I really dig it. 
Post below, I will review in the order posted. Probably cap at like 15 if this goes anywhere, and then see how we feel. I'll stick a list in this post of the review order.

I can see you\'re impatient to get attention and feedback for your work, and I sympathise, but the first lesson to learn here is that improving and making a good comic that gets people\'s attention will both take time.\nYou are still very new to making comics, and the areas you need to work on are your fundamental basics. Get a copy of the book ""Making Comics"" by Scott McCloud and read it all the way through. Try to spend a bit of time every day doing drawing practice of people. The book ""Figure Drawing for All its Worth"" by Loomis can be found as a free PDF here (Warning before clicking link, this book does content some light artistic nudity1), so read that too and spend some time on anatomical studies.Read lots of comics and pay attention to things like how they place characters in panels and environments to create pleasing compositions. Try to incorporate the use of a variety of ""establishing shots"" (shots far away that show the characters at a distance with scenery) ""mid shots"" (zoomed in closer to show just the interaction between characters or a person\'s actions or body language) and ""close ups"" (zoomed right in on just the character\'s face to show their expressions and emotions) in your work.\nBest of luck on your comics making journey.', 'I like Youtube as well but then again it works for me cause I prefer chibis. I found a bunch of channels  where you can draw step by step with them.I know they are directed at kids but it still helps me alot.', ""You should add more backgrounds to your panels. So it doesn't appear that the characters are floating in empty space. Trees, buildings, and roads can help make your panels look more full and complete. You did a little bit of that in the van cline episode you just need to work more on shading and adding texture to the background. Another thing to work on is transitioning from one scene to another. When I was reading your webcomic I wasn't sure if each chapter was a different story or a continuation. There wasn't much of a cohesive flow it was more like every chapter had a new character being introduced. So it doesn't give time for the reader to process what's really going on. You should slow the pace down a bit and visually show how the characters go from one area to another. So you don't have to write a lot of info in the narration dialogue. Also, you don't have to label it narrator. If you're speaking in third person omniscient it will hint to the readers that its a narration. I like the color choices for the characters and skin tone variation. I also like the fight poses and clothing of the characters. I really feel like your story has potential you just have to organize the plot better and work on the art bit more. If you want a good example for your webcomic I recommend looking at the boxer on webtoons.\n\n\nwebtoons.com\n\n\n\nThe Boxer\nYou’ve got the raw talent. Or you’re the underdog.

Spirit Seer | Tapas
After an incident at school Gabriel suddenly became able to see ghosts — or rather only one, a little girl who doesn’t remember her past, Rosie. Following their meeting, Gabriel gets pulled into a world of magic, prophecies and monsters; lying just...





","['Hey, welcome to making comics and to Tapas!\nI want to preface what I\'m about to say with a thumbs up for the effort of making the comic and the guts to seek criticism. I\'m going to be honest here, and it might be a little painful, so I want to be really clear that this isn\'t bad for a first try and you will definitely improve with practice, I don\'t want to put you off making comics.\nSo I think you have an instinctive sense that you\'re maybe pacing this a bit slow because you asked. The answer is, yes, you are pacing it a bit slowly. You\'re drawing out suspense about a mystery that\'s already answered in your blurb. ""Why is there a little girl in old timey clothes in this modern high school?"" ""Oh right, the blurb explicitly says she\'s a ghost.""\nI think you could milk the atmosphere and incongruity of the image of a Victorian era child in a modern highschool if you drew the school environment and kids in more detail. You\'re skimping a little on your environments right now and pulling all your panels in very close to the characters. It\'s a bit repetitive to look at, and you\'d be able to get across the relationship between characters and each other or their environment by pulling the camera back a bit now and again to show more than one person in a panel or the character in the place they\'re in.\nA thing that jumped out as unnatural was the character shouting ""big brother!"" which wouldn\'t really be a thing anyone would say in English. Is this comic meant to be set in a specific country? The characters in the school don\'t wear uniforms, which suggests America or Canada, but shouting ""big brother!"" feels like we\'re in a translated comic from an asian speaking country where you\'d refer to older siblings by title.\nYou could probably space out some of the exposition a bit to save it for when it\'s relevant and try to demonstrate things by showing, rather than telling. Rather than having protagonist ask girl ""can I see other ghosts?"", cut that conversation, then later either have girl talk to another ghost he can\'t see and have him comment ""oh, I can only see you?"" OR have him see another, way scarier ghost and go ""oh god they\'re not all just nice little girls!"" OR have it so there\'s a person on school grounds (like an old guy always sweeping leaves) who he says ""hi"" to early in the story, then at some point when he says ""hi"", girl asks ""who is that man?"" and protag says ""oh, I dunno, an old janitor I guess, I always say hi to him because everyone acts like he doesn\'t exist."" and the girl is like ""well, obviously, they can\'t see him because he\'s a ghost."" Something like that.\nGenerally, just try to think of your images as a storytelling tool and have them do more of the storytelling if you can.\nOverall, it\'s not bad for a first effort, but I\'d definitely advise going and getting a book called ""Making Comics"" by Scott McCloud and giving it a good read through. It\'ll really help you learn basically everything you need to know.', 'Here are my suggestions for your blurb:\nAfter an incident at school Gabriel suddenly became able to see ghosts — or rather only one, a little girl who doesn’t remember her past, Rosie. Following their meeting, Gabriel gets pulled into a world of magic, prophecies and monsters; lying just beneath the daily lives of others. While he struggles through this new but not so different world, mysteries start to unravel.\nIn the first line, you give a lot of details that are irrelevant and does NOT happen in the story. I suggest making it a simple strong, specific statement and pruning out the suspense deflating word ‘suddenly’. \nThe second part of the blurb is quite generic, not telling me anything about how the story is different from any other izekai out there, what stakes Gabriel faces and what character growth he must undergo in order to prevent the worst possible outcome.\nSo, I would start with:\nAfter an incident in school (better yet, describe in two words what happened, like explosion in chemistry class or whatever) Gabriel meets a ghost of an amnesiac girl dressed in Victorian clothes.\nAnd then hit me with the good stuff, the reason why I would want to read your story vs all others.', ""\n\nwocaster:\n\nIf the pacing is too slow(for me, pacing is good.)\nIf dialogues are too long / hard to read / doesn’t make sense(Sometimes too long, need better font and bubbles to be extended further out. Needs to have natural flow.)\nIf characters are relatable / feels unnatural(The ghost standing behind the blond kid feels unnatural? hard to explain)\nIf I am missing out an essential part of comic making process(I think your first two panels is the school's sign. There's a scribble above School...is that the school's name. And we just need to see it once. 2nd scene needs to be the school in a far shot...can be a generic looking school done in sketchup or clipart. The scene with background characters in gray color is not good--I thought they were turned to stone. Sorry. Uhm, maybe take some time to etch the bg characters to look more human than like blocks. You can do it! If the kid is talking to the ghost, then he should be looking at the ghost to help us readers understand who is talking.)\n\nDon't take your comic down. Just do some upgrades/edits/changes and edit the particular episodes. You won't have to lose any of your comments and likes. I had to edit my stuff too, even upgrade my art because it was my first time of drawing my comic and using digital software. \nIf you have any questions, need help, would love to. And your story sounds interesting and fun. I love the blond guy and the way he looks. Great job! It's all in the learning and execution. \nI hope you'll like my story. I've been here for a few years so I learned a lot. \n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nThe Watchman | Tapas\nhttps://www.patreon.com/catluckey\n\nOn the hidden planet, Shatazar, Delah, falsely named princess and her cousin Teeabu, newly-ordained priest turned warrior, live under the powerful rule of the Watchman of Araidia.

321,Review-ception!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Heyo everyone,As the author of The Stalker (A reviewing novel), I have written many reviews before, and I realized that I have never had my novel reviewed itself. As a person who reviews, I think it is very important to get feedback. I feel like my novel is lacking in some places, and while I review other novels, it is hard to review myself, and I was hoping for some outside perspective. I always wonder if my tone should be lighter, if I should write more or write less, and if I am writing some things which do not make sense. I was hoping on some insight in what I can improve on and what more I can do to support other authors on the Tapas community. - Memi MoriHere's my novel: 

tapas.io22



The Stalker | Tapas
This is a novel all about reviewing other novels, especially novels which are lesser known among the Tapas Community. If you want your novel featured either comment or reply to one of my topics on the Tapas Forum.





","[""I really like the concept of having a novel to review other novels, and you write it clearly as well. I  like that you pull quotes from the novel and use it as an example to help pull other readers to it as well.  Also, breaking up the paragraphs really helps to not feel like a mass amount of information thrown at you. You aren't afraid to give your honest opinion in a respectful way, which is refreshing. Personally I like how you write reviews and the information you give."", 'I know of someone who could review your review novel. @violetsun5 we need a review of this review novel.', ""I love the way you write your reviews- it's one of the only reasons I even thought to ask for one. Even though they were personal reviews they came off as objective and professional and you discussed multiple facets of each novel critically. Usually I stray away from reviews because I find them to just be personal opinion columns,  but yours were full of valuable feedback that even a roughly written story could benefit from."", ""You write very good reviews here. I don't really have much to add to what's said above - they come off both objective and critical and yet very helpful at the same time. I feel like I could get a bad review from you and not come away from it wanting to throw in the towel altogether. They read like you have a very good grasp on literary techniques, and particularly in the Prometheus Reanimated one, I appreciated the way you discussed pacing. \nOn a technical note, I like that instead of a 'what i like' and 'what i don't like' format, you actually write this more like an essay, discussing points within contained paragraphs. I think the other method can come across a little unnecessarily harsh. No one wants to see a sentence on what someone likes and three paragraphs on what they don't, stamped off with a negative ending comment and a bad rating. This is a much more engaging and pleasant structure.\nOther than that, I did notice a couple of tense slips, and a few times you misspell either the author name or character name, which I will bet is difficult to catch when it's unfamiliar to you, but a run-over would fix it."", ""Oh wow, I really didn't expect such positive feedback, thank you all so much. I guess I will keep doing what I am doing and making sure that I make sure I make a more limited amount of tense slip ups.I honestly didn't think I was doing that well, thanks so much!- Memi"", 'It is my first time to see ur novel, I saw the title "" Stalker"" I said to myself it is absolutely a horror novel, then I took a look on the 1st episode, I didn\'t get it at first seconds, but then I was like whaat "" is he writing about others works"", it is really awesome to do a such thing, it\'s like you give a trailer of the novel, and u also hit two birds with one rock, you support creators and you make at the same time a novel and that is good .\nMaybe this is not what you\'re waiting for in this topic but it is my own opinion', ""Hello MM, I've been following The Stalker, but I'm not caught up reading it yet. I'll try to do that this weekend. I also have not commented (a little phone trouble) and will see about correcting this injustice. I think you're providing a great service to the community, and I appreciate that you've found a niche to fill. I'd be glad to give you some feedback after my next reading session."", 'I got flagged as being against the rules so...', ""I see your series is back. I'm sorry you had to go thru that. Some people are pretty shitty"", ""I actually haven't heard from staff yet but there are some people harassing me on twitter, claiming I only write negative reviews and basically trashing me where they think I can't see and therefore can't defend myself. Unfortunately I guess, someone sent me a link to it earlier.\nI definitely do not only write negative reviews--I write how I feel about each story I read, and if I run across a story I like, it gets the positive review it deserves. One only needs to look at my reviews on wattpad to see that.\nIn all honesty, I hadn't replied to one of their comebacks and I think it bothered them. I was at the time tired, burned out, and went on a staycation for a little bit during which I did not log into tapas so I actually never saw that comment.\nIf harassment is how this community plays I'm not sure I want to be part of it, tbh."", ""shesh, Thou really I think that goes for alot reviewers once they get some attention.

322,"Just uploaded my first combat only episode, pls could i get some thoughts about it",Reviews | Feedback,[],"Like the title says, i just uploaded my first combat centered episode, it is based 99% on just the fight happening in the story between the MC n some goons, if you're interested in checking it out, could i get some feedback on it, whether the fight choreography was understandable, if you could feel the impact of the blows and follow the little details here n there and if the fight itself made the MC look cool. Also the episode is about 18-20 pages long, can't remember the exact number, so if you're an action junkie like me, you'll get a lot of action in it XDMy series is meant to be a long running action based story, so its no problem if just entering the fight itself might confuse you as to whats going on and how things led there, plus I plan to use the feedback for future episodes since its an action comic, there will definitely be multiple episodes like this just focusing on the fight going on  This here is the link to the episode I'm referring to in the title if you wanna help me with feedback https://tapas.io/episode/186848524If you want to go the extra mile to understand how it all got to there, then probably reading from episode 1 since as its a long format story, things from there are connecting to the build up to this point, thanks for the help ","['This isn\'t bad as your first completely action page, like a lot of it I could follow what you were going for despite the complexity of the scene, so I\'d say overall you did well. The ""The End"" comes in a weird place though, just as an enemy is attacking. A stronger ending would definitely add impact.Not personally a fan of the main character\'s sexist language, but that\'s not really a problem with the fight scene, I guess the character is just kind of a misogynist dick and that\'s how his personality is. As a woman, it makes it hard to feel empathy for that character or particularly care for him when he\'s equating being ""a man"" as strong and cool, while being ""a lil\' bitch"" as weak... But yeah, if that\'s the personality of the character, that\'s the personality of the character.\nIf I could advise other areas for improvement, they would be:\n\nYou need to start the fight with a wide shot of who is in the room and where they all are in relation to each other. People are willing to use suspension of disbelief for enemies all attacking one or two at a time because it\'s more pleasing to watch, but you still need to start off by showing who is there, so new assailants don\'t just keep appearing out of nowhere, and so that there\'s stronger tension as the reader thinks ""oh crap, but what about that guy over there, he still has to fight him!""\nOverall, more shots that are further zoomed out where the characters are standing on a floor would really help give a sense of the space and distance between characters, as well as the scale of them. Especially when stuff is happening like a character being smashed through a roof.\nWatch the direction of your speedlines and the direction of your movement. Sometimes they\'re not lining up, and sometimes you\'re using straight speedlines on a curved movement. Sometimes speedlines are less effective than other clues to movement like hair, clothing or the balance of the pose. Also on speedline backgrounds, varying the thickness, spacing and length of the speedlines, more like how you\'d see them in manga, rather than them being consistent striped patterns would add a lot of dynamism.\nSome of the poses are a little stiff because you\'re not bending or twisting characters at the waist, neck or pelvis much, and you could probably use the creases in the shirt to emphasise the stretch and compression of the body to really add to the energy of poses too. Use the curve of the spine and twist of the waist for springy lines of action to add impact.\n', ""Lol yh, the main character isn't meant to be relatable to people in this scene personality-wise, in the story in general he's meant to be a bit of a prick that can rub people the wrong way and shouldn't be automatically liked by an audience, I was looking to write a rich spoilt character on a journey, his relatability in this scene is based more on the build up to it, since the person he's addressing in the scene did somethings to him and it all led up to this, so he's talking smack at him as he's about to give him his just desserts.\nAs per the areas of improvement you mentionedDefinitely the first 3 points i messed up there and those were the ones i could've definitely addressed if i didnt overlook them, darn it, looking at it as you mentioned it, it would've been best to show that at the beginning so people would know. I definitely didnt convey that to the audience properly  The last two, I will research them and put them in mind, the way you described it reminds me a bit of how motion is depicted in baki the grappler n dragon ballz, the author really got those down, I definitely need to improve there.Thank you so much "", ""\n\nR.n.P:\nthe way you described it reminds me a bit of how motion is depicted in baki the grappler n dragon ballz, the author really got those down\nYes, I'm not familiar with Baki the Grappler, but it looks good, and Dragon Ball is a great place to look. Toriyama is an absolute master at depicting the weight and solidity of his characters, and his impact on punches and kicks has loads of power. Naruto and One Piece are also full of fantastic examples of using the torso, neck and shoulders to really put power and tension into poses."", 'You got some good ideas and for the majority I think you nailed it. There are a few panels that I had harder time to register what was going on. Such as some close ups of him grabbing arms (I had to look at it at least twice to figure out what he was grabbing on to). However this is your first time doing action scenes and they aren\'t easy, so good job keep going!\nRule of thumb: -Keep in mind the 180 rule. try to follow this rule as much as possible and if you want to break it make sure you know why you are breaking it.\nWhen it\'s an action scene make sure the ""Camera"" focuses more on the Action than the Character. (i.e. A claw attack we should see the claw and not the guy being attack\'s reaction. If you really want to show his reaction of being attacked feel free to make a separate panel, It helps build tension.) \nAll that being said I believe you\'re on the right track keep studying Action scenes from movies and comics and try to figure out what you like and why. Good job!', ""Thinking more about the advice you gave, I'm going to start writing down episode plans before i start drawing so i know where to start from and how to start, I usually draw instinctively and just try to covey whatever hypes me the most to the readers but maybe i need to be more calculated in my drawings.\n@dewarcomics I'll keep what you said about keeping the reaction and the action separated from each other when drawing so readers know what to focus on, I'm not to familiar with the exceptions of the 180 rule tho when drawing i try to make it seem more like an anime being drawn in the most manga style possible so i try to flip positions of the characters from time to time to make it more dynamic .Thanks for your help ""]",9/3/2020 4:10,https://forums.tapas.io/t/just-uploaded-my-first-combat-only-episode-pls-could-i-get-some-thoughts-about-it/48362,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","['Hello I am the writer of a webtoon called peek-a-boo I was wondering if you could share your opinions on our prologue \n\n\nwebtoons.com5\n\n\n\nPEEK - A - BOO\nThe story is about five friends who get tangled up into a murder case which leads to more drama and lies. It is a mind bending story full of mystery.\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""That escalated very quickly.  I love the art style though, and I loved the setting you chose. It leaves the reader wanting to know more at the end, although I wish I knew the characters' names. I also kind of wish I knew more about their relationship so that I could feel more connected to them emotionally, but I have a feeling that your webtoon will most likely go back and explain everything in the episodes to come. The dialogue was extremely relatable though! I think it's a great start so far!"", 'Thankyou!!!! So much and yeah we will be explaining it in  the backstory.We did not include the names for a reason which is a secret 🤭🤭🤭', 'Mysterious backgrounds are the best ', ""If you have the time, any thoughts or opinions on my comic Paw Prints would be great! Any chapter is fine; you don't gotta read it all!\nhttps://tapas.io/series/Paw-Prints1"", 'I ended up reading through all 5 episodes! It kind of reminded me at the end how people in movies get lucky when stealing a car because for some weird reason somebody left the keys inside the car. I also love how out of an entire impound, they chose the slowest possible and most obvious vehicle  I found it entertaining, especially getting little pieces of their background before they met up. The only comment I have is about the first chapter when Mae ran out the door and her brother said “Whait hup!” I don’t know if it was intentional because of maybe the way the character speaks but it sounded just a little odd to me instead of saying “Wait up!” I also like the drawn/painted backgrounds over the picture-based one of the waterpark. Anyways, I thought it was really cute and entertaining so far ', ""I've wanted to get an opinion on this episode: https://m.tapas.io/episode/18047372\nI had heard from others their opinion on R, one of the main characters for the webcomic and would like to hear yours too about it."", 'I like R a lot, she’s very down to Earth, and her anxiety with admitting to Luigi that she’s jealous makes her both relatable and realistic as a character. I also like the use of ellipses to demonstrate awkward pauses in the conversation, although I would advise you to be sure not to overuse them because I’ve heard from some readers that it can get annoying (I use ellipses a lot, so I’ve been cutting down )\nDo you mind telling me your thoughts about the chapters I mentioned at the top?

Due to this...\n\n\n\n\n\nAy if you're still open i would love it if i could get a review on my latest episode.Mainly focusing on the short fight that happened, wanted to hear the thoughts about it since my next episode is meant to be completely action focused"", 'tragic fate Huba Petrosinova met just like...\nI would suggest putting a comma between met and just so that it\'s more fluid. \nbut a few dared to look at them, and when...\nI would also suggest ending this sentence at ""them"" and starting the next sentence like:\nWhen they did, all you could hear were deep sighs, poor attempts to hide the tears.\nI think it will help your first paragraph read much smoother. Basically any time you have a compound sentence like--I ran, and she followed--you only want to combine two independent clauses. Meaning you don\'t want to add another ""and"" or ""but"" after the first one like--I ran, and she followed, and he stayed. In this case, it would be better to write--I ran, and she followed. He stayed. This doesn\'t apply though to adding extra dependent clauses though like--I ran, and she followed and tripped.--since ""and tripped"" doesn\'t include another subject. I hope this makes sense...I just thought the tip might help for the future.\nHer eyelids had become led...\nLast spelling/grammar error I\'ll point out, I promise: I think you meant to say ""lead"" here instead.\nOverall, I think your second chapter is very engaging, and I love the descriptions you use to talk about Huba and Kalinka. I think they\'re very vivid and easy to picture. I also like the way you describe actions and the emotions on the characters\' faces because it makes them more emotionally appealing to the reader. I think this chapter is captivating, especially with the conflict mentioned towards the middle of the chapter. Kalinka\'s conflict also adds a layer of excitement to the chapter that keeps the story moving forward. Great work! I hope this review helps with the translating and the grammar and that you continue writing more of Daystar! ', 'Thank you for reading, as well as the advice. I will try to improve my translation and grammar .', 'I think the action scenes were easy to follow and pretty entertaining, especially when the character broke through the wall and kicked the other guy in the face. That scene definitely stuck out as the most clear fight scene because the background wasn\'t too distracting, and it was only focused on what was happening between those two characters. I also really love how expressive their faces are when they get hurt or when they lash out because then you can feel their emotion or pain. However, I do wish that the sound effects or the actions marked with ""< >"" were more engaging. For example, when you say ""flip,"" it might be more engaging to say ""fwip"" or make some kind of similar sound word to interact with the reader more. I also would\'ve liked to have seen more punctuation to really exaggerate questions or the dialogue where the characters are yelling at each other. For instance, saying at the end, ""YOU\'RE GONNA DIE!!!"" instead of just, ""YOU\'RE GONNA DIE"".

325,Come get your reviews!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Notice a trend of review for review, I am not asking for a review of mine (it would be nice though), but I am willing to review peoples comic. I'll review your comic and comment on what I think are four critial points for comics:
Art - I'll review based on your art and not necesary compare to other works. It'll be if the art fits the story/setting among other details.
Writing - This is all in the flow of text, amount and of course the style.
Paneling - This is a rather overlook part of comic, but paneling is really important!
Story - The core of all comic and in reality of most entertainment media, the story aspect!
If you plan to review my comic all I ask is that you please at least go past the first few chapters on my comic, I did improvements starting from 5 and up! Here is my comic:


tapas.io45



B.R.A - Big rumble Academy | Tapas
Welcome to B.R.A, an academy for extraordinary people. Follow the comedy mischief of a group of friends consisting of a vampire, mage, shape shifter among others! 

See how they always manage to get in weird situations, but still manage to survive...





","['I saw that no one\'s reviewed your comic yet, so I thought I would send you one!\n-Art- First, I want to congratulate you on improving your art! In less than a year, you\'ve made great progress. The line art is smoother, the colors are more appealing to the eye, and the text is much more clear. I love seeing how artists evolve over time, and you\'ve really come a long way!\nWith that being said, I would like to challenge you to continue honing your skills. Some areas I noticed could use some improvement are adding a wider variety of poses and angles of the face and body. A majority of your faces are either full frontal, the backside, or a full profile. Try adding a three quarter turn or some dynamic poses when necessary. This will give your characters more life! \nAs for the background, I was overjoyed when you started hand drawing your backgrounds. Personally, I don\'t like SketchUp as I feel it disconnects the characters from the scene (this is just a personal preference of mine). The change your hand drawn background added to your comic was amazing! Suddenly it felt like your characters finally existed in this world you\'re creating. And while you don\'t necessarily have to be extremely detailed in your background and environment scenes, I will say that readers appreciate seeing the details of the setting. It\'s a ton of work (which is why I understand when artists use SketchUp as it saves an infinite amount of time), but the effort goes a long way for your readers!\n-Writing-There were a few grammatical errors throughout your comic. Some of them being mistakes anyone would make such as the correct use of ""your/you\'re"". Another mistake I caught was using ""is"" instead of ""it\'s"" - this happens a few times in the episode ""Miko\'s fight!"". Luckily, this is an easy fix! Consider typing out your sentences in either a Word document or your Google Drive and search for misspellings. \nSome of the writing threw me off. There were times that I wasn\'t quite sure what was happening or there was too much text in one panel for me to easily read. One example of this is in the episode ""Towards Splash Gardena!"" where the gang is sitting in the bus. There is a lot of text and the panel feels ""cluttered"". \n-Paneling-If I had to pinpoint one thing to improve on in your comic, I would say it\'s the paneling. I think you need to add more panels! There are a few scenes that were hard to follow because we didn\'t get to see enough. One that sticks out the most was the scene in the bus when Rac dropped the baby photo of his sister. The panel inside of the panel was a little awkward. Instead, consider showing a full panel with Rac dropping the piece of paper instead of the very small panel with his fingers. This comic is all about humor, but if your readers have to work to interpret what is happening in your scenes, the joke may fly over their heads!\n-Story-I can see the makings of a future plot lingering under the humor, but it\'s too soon for me to tell you exactly what my opinions are on plot line. However, I do enjoy reading how your characters interact with one another. Despite what I mentioned earlier, the school bus ride in ""Towards Splash Gardana!"" has to be my favorite so far! \nOver all, I think you\'re doing great! You\'re improving with every update and it\'s clear that this comic and your characters mean a lot to you. In the end, all that I\'ve mentioned is only the opinion of one person. If you choose to ignore everything I\'ve said because it\'s not the direction you want your comic to go, then that\'s fine! This is your comic. Do what makes you happy \nP.S. I don\'t expect you to thoroughly review my comic because I have 85 episodes lol. I won\'t subject any person to have to undergo that challenge. However, I\'d love it if you just check it out!\n\n\ntapas.io14\n\n\n\nThose Called Wolf :: Chapter 2: Her Broken World | Tapas\nChapter 2 starts tomorrow!\n\nI hope you guys are as excited as I am!\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""You seem to understimate that I had already read yours when I found it in a promotion thread xP I was hooked and read it in one setting without noticing I read everything! Thanks for your amazing review and all your points are indeed valid. I am working on different angles and more dynamic look in my future chapters as to not always have the same angle as you mention. I didn't think of using word, but I think I will now for grammar and better flow of text \nWorking on the paneling, time was short on the bus one cause I wanted to have three more panels on the photo drop (Rac slip, he trying to catch the photo, everyone looking to the floor and then the photo reveal...time beat me though xP). But I do get the panel is important and the flow of them, so slowly trying to have better transition and give a clearly picture. But enough about mine, time for the review!\n-Art-\nYou art is really amazing and is what caught my eye to check it out. Really clean line art and colors fit the overall feel of the story, the rather dark overtone is perfect on the prologue and first chapter where hope is all but gone. I know the prologue and the first chapter is mostly setting and is pretty much all bleak (the witch kidnap, viper going to help, fight breaks out). So not sure if color overtone change when normal town with a bit brighter feel to difference for when in despair, but I would do that to give it different contrast is all.\nWriting\nI like that you don't over impose with a lot of text, you use enough to give us the correct information without hitting us in the head with exposition over the top. Great font use as is easy to read and fit the overall feel of the story. Really like the sound effect having their own font and place in a way that help the panel instead of being there for the sake of having it. I would use the three dots (...) method a bit more. For example in page 24 there are two line that do connect, adding the three dots at the end to give a bit of feel of a 'stop' or 'hesitation' when speaking before he/she continues the sentence. Otherwise, great writing and is really easy to follow.\n-Paneling-\nThis is where it gets a bit tricky, you have a one page format which is great, but is done in the traditional style of manga/comic. As in panels to the side and with a page restriction of that style. I am not sure if you publish in traditional way and that is the reason but I think you could really take advantage of the webcomic format more. One big example is page three, if you use the webcomic format of panel going downward, the reveal of her true evil face of pleasure for being able to go in a killing rampage would had been more impact and a bigger surprise as people would scroll down, first seeing her confidence arrival, then her 'goofy' side of 'we didn't burn' and the keep scrolling still not seeing that 'face' till a bit more scrolling and then when they reach it they might go 'Well damn, didn't see that coming!'.\nThis is of course just my two cent on panels for webcomic format, if publishing is main goal then manga/comic style is indeed the prefer method as webcomic format is not ideal for traditional publishing xP\n-Story-\nReally like how you did the set up, you clearly estabilish the villian without any doubt, the internal turmoil of the main character and the overall lore/setting in one well done first chapter. Antagonist where place as well as help and Viper's personality. This without over exposure and all in a natural way. I am looking foward to how the continue continues to develop as time goes on, but fear not that you  have a loyal reader here! \nHope this review helps and really thank you for taking your time on mine!"", ""Doing a review for @lynestjules and her comic: https://tapas.io/series/Megami-Shiizun4\n-Art-\nI like the evolution of your art from chapter 1 to chapter 3. Expression became more varied and the eyes became better (there use to be to much white space and the eye where to small). I believe you should use the eyebrows more for expression, when screaming the eyebrows either become 'flat' or more vertical line (think / ) cause of the face changing with the scream. You tend to keep them arc most of the time and eyebrows are a great tool for expression (along side eyes) so try using them more in various ways. \nI like your subtle change of color to warmer ones, it fits nicely with your story. As for line art I would try making them a bit more thick to give them a bit more weight, specially in close up shots of the face.\nLike I mention your art gives me a disney princess like vibe and I think it fits the story well!\n-Writing-\nI think you try to space out more the speech bubbles and organize them more, it can be tricky following which one I need to read next in some of them and maybe try to have less speech in some of them as to move the dialogue a bit easier and faster. \nI'll use Chapter 2 Page 18 as an example. You got a zigzag like speech bubble movement, but one of the bubbles break as is not sure which goes first and then the other. It makes reader have to do a big of mental gymnastic and breaks the flow of text.\n-Paneling-\nI see you like to use panels within panels quite a few times. But I think that should be use to highlight something in the panel and not that often. Spacing out the panels help the reader follow the story and art easier, giving is a webcomic format vertical should be priority on paneling. It space them out more, allow you to work better on your speech bubble and text and gives breathing room to the art and reader (to many close panels can give a feeling of everything being cramp). I do like the amount of panels use and the one page update, but I do belive they can be space better.\nWebtoon actually release a really good guide on this that gives many helpful tips, suggest to check it out!\n-Story-\nI like the setting you planted about the mysterious winter and the specter. I am still a bit lost on the whole 4 daughters thing and I believe a narrated part of maybe the king explaining this as a backstory or information in a bit more detail would had help as there is to much sudden exposition about them and the guys to be able to keep up with. I did like the introduction of winter's daughter and the red head that I am assuming is a villain xP I still think you can slow down the pace a bit on important elements (such as winter's daughter introduction, the explanation on their birth, etc).\nI am liking the lore overall and waiting to see what other powers show up and how the manifest!\nOverall keep the work as I am loving your consistency on working on the series since 2016 and the improvement that can be notice "", ""Thanks a lot. It's a very good review with some great cc tips. Always appreciated. It helps me grow.\nArtThanks for the feedback on my art. Especially about the colouring. I'm going to try to focus more on eyebrows now and working on the poses and whatnot. I try to challenge myself on every chapter to get better. \nWritingI'm going to try to slow down things a little in this upcoming chapter as there's going to be a lot of things happening that will hopefully tie things together that seem a little scattered at the moment, but it was planned to be that way. Also going to work on those bubbles, I've noticed the problem with the speech bubbles as well, when I read my hard copies over last weekend. I completely understand why it needs to be fixed. \nPanelingI get it. I'll try to minimize the inside paneling. As for spacing, I know on Tapas and Webtoons it's on the web, but it's actually a hard copy comic book and the pages are print ready. But, I'll still check out that tip on Webtoons.\nStory\nI know there's a lot of backstory missing, but it's not for now. The births of the girls is a very important factor and a very complicated one. There's planned moments where those missing pieces will be explained. But, it's out of place to tell them at this particular moment. Chapter 4 will definitely be slowed down quite a bit, because there's going far too much information to pay attention to.Hopefully the delivery won't disappoint. And I got myself a proofer to go over my spelling. I'm francophone and even if I'm bilingual, sometimes I make mistakes."", ""Thank you so much for the advice! \nI see where you're coming from with adding more ellipsis, especially with page 24 you mentioned. \nAs for paneling, I do want to have a hard copy of my comic one day, so I stuck with the single page format, but believe me, I do feel the draw backs. There are a ton of things I could have done with the webcomic format such as the one you mentioned with page 3. That would have been so cool! And I will, unfortunately, never have the chance to appear in a Daily Snack as those are usually reserved for comics with the typical down scrolling format. \nIt made me so happy to see that you're already a reader, that really brought a smile to my face "", 'I’m a newbie at giving critiques, but I’ll try my best!\nARTYour art has improved so much since the first chapters! The shaky lineart has transformed into smooth confident lines, also the way looks better since there is a wide variety of color using also some desaturated tones, you have taken a good grasp of light and shadows, you shading fits with the source of light rather than just darkening the same places. The way you draw poses is very good and they don’t seem off even with different perspectives. Maybe it can improve even more with some quick anatomy studies, I have tried them and they are pretty fun to do.I agree with thefalsevyper with the background thing, it looks much better when you draw it instead of using a 3d program.\nWRITINGI love the font that you’re using, it looks super smooth and it is very comfortable to read. Sometimes I get the feeling that the speach bubbles’ tails are too short and wide and the lines that connect different bubbles (for example in en. 13 when Rac is being criticized) are too thick. I think that if you made them thinner it would look better. I can’t help on grammar cause English isn’t my first language (I you haven’t guessed it by now XD), but I find the dialogue easy to follow.\nPANNELINGThe vertical scroll format you’re using is very cool and gives you many great resources to play with pacing and flow. I think you could take more advantage of it by exaggerating more the gap between scenes to slow the action or for dramatic moments, or reduce it a lot to give a feeling of speed. \nSTORYAs far as I had read I’m really enjoying your comic, it has some really funny moments. All of your characters have an unique personality and quirks (I’m specially fond of Morph’s awful luck) that creates a light atmosphere.\nI like your comic and i think that it’s a great beginning and looks very promising, and I hope that I could be of some help. Can’t wait to see more!\nHere’s mine if you want to check it:\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nBurning Shadows | Tapas\nIn a world where Asters and dragons are considered nothing more than myths, Flare, who seems to be kind of a dragon hybrid, wakes up with no memories.

Still hope the rest of the review helps and look foward to more \n@TheFalseVyper Yeah, is a bit hard to use the other method for comic (the page turn) cause since is a page update each certain time making a reader wait for the 'reveal' might make them more mad than happy lol I seen some traditional style comic in the daily snack so don't lose hope. Your comic is great and deserves a spot there!\n@Chita Thanks for the review and yeah moving away from sketchup was a welcome change to myself and it actually has help me improve  I'll try the anatomy quick study since is something I indeed need improvement. I'll try getting the review out soon, I actually had read your comic before and I am sub, but I like to re-read some aspect and give a good second look for a proper review. Is sadly about 11 pm here right now and my brain is fried from the day xP I hope you don't mind waiting for tommorrow for proper review "", ""Heya! Here's my review: It has a good story but it often has grammar and spelling errors. The paneling is kind of disruptive at times and sometimes the art appears shaky.

A market place is one of that hard places to get right (lots of people, movement and variety of things all around) and you did it well. I notice the line art can sometimes be a bit shaky or lines overlap while in others they are smooth, a bit of consistancy there and I belive your line art will become better  Love the variety of expression you use and they all look great!\n-Writting-\nI belive you should try to use fonts instead of handwritting (I am assuming it is hand written). It can be really hard to read sometimes and fixing a typo someone might points out is more of a hassle. I like your prologue, it explain enough without and over abundance of text. I do like the ammount of text you have, not to much, but good enough to follow the story and good use of 'sound effects' all around.\n-Paneling-\nAgain this is me thinking on the webcomic format. But from now on I'll review it for webcomic and manga as this is in the preference of the creator.\nFor webcomic a vertical way is better, it helps in the spacing of moments and foir easy reading. You have a manga style one and the reading has been good, I haven't seen any big reveal that would benefit from the format of webcomic so I don't think changing your paneling is need. I will say that maybe leaving 'breathing' space between panels will help. Really close panels cause claustrophobic feeling which is actually a great effect to use in tense and action moments, reason is best to space them out in normal moments and use the tight close together ones for more tense moments.\n-Story-\nI really like the back story setting to everything, it explains the lore in good detail without over exposing everything. It set up the main character perfectly as she is the only thing that matter (in her mind that is) and that is great set up. Not much else has happen so can't tell much about the development of the story but my interest is picked by the prologue and potential.\n-Character-\nI added this category as besides story, the main characters themself are just as important. I like how you set up the personality of the main character thru actions and interactions instead of telling it. Showing the personality is a great way to establish a character! \nI hope to see more of it as I love the design of the city and characters! Hope this helps you and motivates you to keep going!"", ""@A-weird-girler Thank you for your time and points, trying to fix the grammar in parts, the first chapters are bad in this regard indeed. I know the lines where shaky in the first, but I think I fix them (still need work but no shaky) after say episode 8, but I'll keep improving them (need to work on thickness and other parts). Here is my review of yours:\n-Art-\nI did read about the different art style representing a different view (At least that is what is said in the description?) but it was still hard to find why and who the switch represented. The comic starts in one style (no outline and just colors), then is a different saturation of colors and with outline, then the third is a different style and then back to the outline which is the one constant for now. I do like the idea, but I think is best to use some transition panels if the change in art style represent a change of view.\nI think the head to body proportions feels a bit off in some aspect, or at least the feel a bit off.\nI do love your various expression and that panels all offer a subtle but noticeable movement if everything is happen at the same moment, which is really good to know the characters way of thinking or why they are saying something.\n-Writting-\nI notice someone already mention this, but I think circle bubbles will be better. Most reader already have the mental picture that a square box is more like a narrator speaking or an establishing moment than actual converstation. I also think there is a lot of text at times Example is Chapter 1 Ep 10. She repeats 'in the beginning' three times. I know there is a way of writing that is 'énfasis' where things are repeated, but not sure it works here. I think sometimes less tells more than having a lot of text.\n-Story-\nI like the mystery planted from the start about she being a patient, about there past interactions and course wanting to learn more about the circumstances of everyone as there is a large variety of cast. Is an interesting case to tackle (mental health among other things) that is not as easy so I look foward to development of the interactions!\nHope this helps you out! "", ""Hey Dak, I'm not used to doing reviews but here are my suggestions/thoughts:\nArt- I think it's great to see so much improvement from the first ep to the last.  I think what you comic could benefit from is more variety in the angles and/or poses you choose.  I feel there are a lot of front facing poses and it would be nice to see more poses were the characters are engaged with eachother, looking and talking and interacting with eachother, That said I do feel you have been doing this more in recent chapters.\nAnother thing I think could help, things that are really far in the background in addition to blurring them you may want to soften them by making them less saturated or less dark in comparison to the people in the front.  This helps the people pop.  Otherwise the details of the background can draw attention away from the people.  (obviously if you want the background to be the main focus you wouldn't do this tho.)\nWriting/Story(sorta comments on both)- The flow is sometimes off. Some scenes I feel need more build up, and some scenes need more context.  I also would have liked more explanation at the beginning.  Why did the character decide to enroll in the school?  More explanation for the powers the characters have.  And overall more world building before just jumping into the comedy. I felt like a lot of these topics were rushed into and it makes for a rocky start that is harder to follow.  I am enjoying the juvenile developments of the characters tho and the overall lighthearted nature of the comic.  It gives me a good chuckle that the name is BRA.\nPaneling - this seems to be improving quite a bit.  But touching up on the writing feedback, there needs to be more panels to portray certain concepts.   Also I feel like there could be more variation on where you place your panels.  Like have some panels that are shifted to the right, some on the left, some in the middle.  This causes the eyes to shift around the comic more and add some aesthetics.  It also allows you to play with the placement of the speech balloons more, again the goal being that the eyes jump around the page."", ""Man, I never thought on the blur aspect on the backgrounds! That is just a brilliant tip O_O I was always fighting how to blend them in a bit more to make the characters stand out! I am actually engaging in more angles indeed, I notice I was doing the similar stale 'look foward or side ways' and it makes scene lack a certain movement.\nYeah, I think I should had done a prologue instead of waiting for the moment this is explain since is a bit further ahead.I notice my first chapters 'arcs' don't deal with the super natural aspect to much which makes people start to wonder about their powers among other reasons xP I think I'll work on that prologue or an in between chapter!\nI am actually glad for the webtoon contest cause it brought in a LOT of tips on paneling that I am so going to use! I fall in the pit that I draw and work on the manga standard format and then split it up for webcomic standard.\nI'll be reviewing yours shortly (finishing some panels). I actually began reading a manga that reminds me so much of your comic (the main characters has roses flying around that bothers everyone, etc). I only went 'They copied chase!' xP"", ""@beta1042  Here is my full review, I'll be touching on thing I said in my first overview \n-Art-\nI still say your gradual improvement is amazing. You started with shaky lines, pre-made backgrounds that clash a bit and lack of shadows. Now your line are so clean and good proportion in thickness depending on the distance and better use of colors (better saturation and variety). You are tackling backgrounds yourself and they are coming out nicely, yet I still find the character somethings feel like they float in the background. I think use of 'darker' shade close to there feet might help in that aspect to connect them a bit more to the backgrounds (Expecially floor spaces).\nAlso speaking of shadows, I re-read a few chapters (start, middle and end) and notice there isn't much change in how the shadows are cast across. I think changing them up a bit, expecially if is a face to face conversation where the light is cast to face of someone while to the other the light is cast from behind. It hasn't affect the story or anything, but for future it might help (Especially in the chapter were Ben is kind of trying to get with Gwen in a way she is not liking it, it might had work a bit more to show it was an uncomftable situation).\nOtherwise your improvement is quite noticible and welcome! I really like your style \n-Writting-\nAnother big improvement, on the first a lot of text was used (which is of course understandable since is setting up episode), but now the text are all concrete and easy to follow and gives all the information we need as the rest we can tell by the characters expression or setting. \nReally like the different bubble colors per character, it makes it easy to know who said what, specially in parts where that are multiple characters around. I also like that you kept it simply on the font and use two at most, the normal talk one and a cursive like one for 'special' text or effects. Works really well.\n-Story-\nI am really, really glad this isn't the usual 'After 100 episode...they finally hold hands...100 episode more and they finally confess...50 episode more and an answer is receive!'. I like the fact they become a couple early but still have struggles and of course the people around that this affect. Is good to have a story which is about the relationship and not on 'how they became a couple'. \nI like you make sure to devotee an episode to a character when they are introduce or re-appear after awhile to get us interested on them. I remember you once ask me that you were afraid if it was to predictable on who ends with who and I still stand by that in a romance story that isn't the important part, but the how and when and what. We want to know how they end up together and the struggles they face to get there and of course the struggles they face as a couple.\nYou are doing a fine job there, introducing the one that might want to break them up and someone that will try to get to know Gwen more and of course the internal turmoil of Manson.\n-Characters-\nChase is hand down a great character, the sparkle idea gives it a nice touch of comedy that works amazing. His curiosity for most thing we take as normal or natural is quite interesting too.\nMason as the best friend with a bit of complex that girls use him to get to chase is nice. We know this hurts him a lot and make him a bit weary of girls approaching him, but he still a good friend to Mason.\nGwen and Fi are great two, they fit like a glove in Fi being the more rebel risky one and Gwen the more calm passive but with her own touch of passion and courage. The other cast have appear less, but Ben role is establish perfectly and he does such a good job at it xP Valerie is also good and an interesting rival with a bit of mystery on why she hates Gwen so much.\n-Overall-\nI love that you kept improving as you continue your story as it shows the care and interest you have in telling it. Great cast of characters and a nice romance story  I'll keep reading it for a long time! "", '@Daknight Oh yes, the rest was really helpful.

326,Fresh Hot Comic Reviews!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Well, I'm off work today and a bit bored so I figured why not review some comics and maybe get something new for my library. One thing I will try to avoid reviewing is the art, for me personally as long I can still be absorbed in the story it won't bother me too much. I'm only looking for comics! I'm a big fan of action, science fiction and horror, but all types are welcome. If your comic is super long I'm going to read a minimum five chapters, but possibly more if I'm invested. 
Alright, enough rambling. I'm going to post my own comic underneath just for kicks, if you like it check it out. Let's see some comics!
EDIT: I'm still making my way down the list!  Feel free to keep dropping comics! I've linked a google doc if you'd like to see my progress! Please understand there are a lot of you, but I am determined to give each and everyone of you a review.

I'm blown away with the quality of the story. It hits all of those classic sweet spots of the shows I used to binge watch back during college. The magic system is simple and understandable which is always a plus. The characters are likable and I get that we can't focus on everyone at once (it is the first chapter after all), but I would have loved focusing on a smaller portion of the cast first and then expanding. That's just a personal choice, but it appears we'll be fleshing them out as we go along and I am completely for that! \nI particularly enjoyed Marianne as well as any scenes the Asura is in. The interrogation scene is so far my favorite and I like the twist (which I won't be spoiling here for anyone reading along). Another very well handled thing was the use of tropes. I loved seeing you touch on how usually this is how magic evil situations start out and that instead of going the typical route of kids making a mistake you decided to subvert it. I look forward to reading the rest of your work! \n...also I already was subscribed to your comic. I read one of the later chapters a month or so back, liked the art, subbed and forgot about it until now, but if I could re-sub I would! Good job!"", ""Please review my comic!

I enjoyed the build up of Roger's misery over the first few pages, however it kind of felt a bit undercut when I learned more about him. He's a very brash guy which is great, but his negative traits tend to overpower the bad traits at times, which is a totally fine thing for a character, but multiple times I stopped wanting to root for him. By contrast however, I did like Fanboy (the pages I've read so far I couldn't find his name so I just stuck with that for now) he had negative traits, but I saw enough of his good ones to actually like him. Now, this is going to come off as a bit contradictory, but I will say, I ultimately do respect you chose to craft a brash, harsh, reality compared to the air brushed, happy ones we usually have on Tapas (and I'm also guilty of that in my comic as well) \nSo the story itself is nice, I personally think the more simple a premise the more material you have to work with and this is an excellent example of that. The bus angle is brilliant and can easily be used to farm heroes, villains, anti heroes and it's just a good idea all around.\nFormatting wise my only note is that I would make the text bigger and if you're using something huge like the tree monster use bigger, more expressive shots.

The story flows well, but one thing I would suggest is maybe removing the possible fate of Sonny's brother. I know it's a mystery and this is just a personal thing, but considering it ends up being a major reveal later on it's just something to think about. Sorry for that aside, but the story is great so far. I like the concept of Vultures and want to know more of this world, not to mention I'm dying to see Nia. \nI love Sonny and Roach's relationship only because I'm always a sucker for that. Sonny himself is a good main character, I like pain in his eyes when he learns about Corvan and I want more of that. Morbid to say, but I want Sonny to suffer! That suffering is creating juicy character development! You've got a good world, fun characters, stellar art and line work and a good mystery brewing so I suggest keep pushing, lean into it and I look forward to the next page. \nI also particularly like how Roach is posed and drawn.

So, instead they are using technologies in stupid or evil way and have a lot of problems because of this.Most of those fictional technologies have come from my serious thoughts about further developing of contemporary technologies, but some are somewhat metaphorical or made just for fun, with a bunch of black humor.

I also would be happy for sure, if it would become popular and bring me a bit of money, but for now I don\'t know how to make it that way.\nWhat is your target AUDIENCE? Man, don\'t ask.

Thank you in advance, anyway.', 'Alright, here we go, first round.\nGoals:\n\nYou got over a hundred subscribers and a few thousand views, so you clearly have a grasp of how to grip people. I personally am not one for most comedy strips, but I\'m definitely impressed you\'ve amassed a comfortable clique of readers. That\'s awesome. You\'re certainly making progress in your hopes of amassing an audience--you get a handful of comments on most updates, which has eluded at least 80% of the comics I see, including my own.\nI\'m surprised to see you are gunning for young teens and adults. Other than the peppering of profanity, the comic oozes a Saturday morning cartoon feel. It is shamelessly childlike, impish, and nonchalant, as are almost all of your characters. Hard to say if you are meeting your goal here, since as I\'ve said you got 100 or so people at your back.\n""I\'m making the comic to improve my art."" I know EXACTLY what you mean. I feel a kinship there, man, I\'m in the same boat. I hope you have the will to improve. As an ongoing endeavor, it\'s not something I can say you failed, but that brings us to:\n\nArt:I\'m not personally a fan of this style, but I recognize that it is a popular and successful approach. The character designs are reminiscent of that French cartoon Dofus, especially E, who bears a striking aesthetic resemblance to Julith. As I said before, the comic screams Saturday Morning Cartoon--a delightful niche and certainly popular.\n\nLet\'s talk about your goal of improving your art. Progress has DEFINITELY been made, particularly in the face. I\'m actually a big fan of your faces, particularly E\'s, who is clearly the barometer of your ability. We can track your improvements through E more than any other character, arguably even more than Josie (there\'s a non-art reason for this, I\'ll get to that later).\nSadly, the same progress in the face and general polish has not extended to your hands, feet, or character stiffness. Best example I have is that in Chapter six, the only times your hands look well made and convincing are in Part 2 Panel 4 and Part 4 panel 3. The rest of them look misshapen. Your feet are also long and unnervingly floppy, and not simply because they\'re in slippers. Chapter 5 is a great example of how stiff your legs look. The confrontation between E and Josie is static and bizarrely slow because they both have angular, rigid legs in almost every panel. You\'ll get there, but you definitely should pay close attention to character rigidity and hand construction.\nThe lighting is by far the most convincing part of your art--I am currently struggling to nail that down myself, and I could take some hints from your work here. Being handicapped that way, I can\'t say if it is accurate or perfect, but as just a few degrees north of a layperson, I can say that it is convincing and effective enough to make me think it looks great. Every character benefits ENORMOUSLY from the lightwork. Well done.Chapter 6 Part 4 is the best showcase for this.\n\nWriting:* Now writing is something with which I\'m fairly confident. I have to say that I find the dialogue either unappealing, uninteresting, or downright confusing. My biggest critique of your whole work revolves around the capriciousness of every single character and every single exchange. I have only the slightest idea of what each character\'s personality is meant to be. Josie waffles from vaguely self aware to mindless, nasty trouble maker; Bugbot keeps switching from dutiful servant to insubordinate flipster; Xenor starts as a mysterious trickster and then almost IMMEDIATELY becomes the straight man of the zaniness. This is far and away the most destructive aspect of your comic. I don\'t know how anyone is able to find stable character foundations on which to become attached to characters. Josie is particularly frustrating. She\'s an agent of chaos, devoid of personality, whose only narrative purpose seems to provoke slightly more interesting characters. I really think you need to sit down and plan out their arcs, if you haven\'t alredy, because not one of these bastards is likable. Bugbot and E are closest.\nSpeaking of E, remember when I said that she was a better barometer of your progress than your main character? It\'s due in large part to the feeling I get that you are infinitely more interested in E than Josie. Josie is a robot programmed to start shit, and E has the seeds of growth. E looks more interesting, acts with more nuance, and has enough mystique to suggest that maybe something worth waiting for is in her arc. Josie has none of that. I don\'t know if she\'s meant to be a self insert or a blank slate, but she has nothing going for her. \nThe writing in general definitely underscores that your goal is to improve your art, because I can\'t sense you\'ve put any effort into the narrative. It\'s a disjointed, chaotic, aimless mess of a story. Profanity isn\'t doing any favors either. Profanity almost always dilutes personality and expressive dialogue, as far as I can tell.\nSummation:Your goals are worthy ones, and you are achieving them, some quicker than others. That eclipses a lot of my complaints, which, as a reminder, come from somebody who probably wouldn\'t consume this kind of story anyway, regardless of quality. You got a lot going for you, and your art is definitely improving, but a focused, deliberate practice of hand and leg anatomy as well as aggressively practicing flow and gesture will really make this look great. Your writing is sloppy and uninspiring, but you have reasons for that, if not excuses. Good luck, man, and keep working your magic with your audience. I\'m green with envy looking at those delicious comments.', ""I'll post my comic in a bit. I'm as desperate for feedback as anyone--nobody wants to be shrieking into the void--but I'm just as interested in getting momentum going. Lots of critique threads die slow painful deaths.\nReading your comic now. Serious fantasy adventures are definitely up my alley."", ""Premise: It's an anthology so it varies both in genre/tone. We use narrators to tie the various arcs together as best we can\nIntentions/expectations: Because it's a group thing that varies greatly too. I know it sounds like a cop out but we range from happy to be in the group to wanting to rule the world.

If you are pursuing a serious tone, you would do well to have a more reverent summary, especially if it\'s your own stuff. You put in the work, it won\'t sound obnoxious to take yourself seriously. I know that I sometimes am tempted to be self deprecating or irreverent to my own comic, but I say that\'s a trap. You\'ve earned the right.\nOk, on to the Meat.\nGoals:You seem light on goals and expectations, which is not an issue, and may even be a blessing. I love to see people finally get to start something they\'ve been preparing so long for. It helps me put down emotional roots at the get go. I can share in a portion of the joy of creation, appreciate the drama of the comic\'s existence. I hope you\'re maintaining the energy and enthusiasm for your work.\nYou should definitely think about the type of reader you want to pull. Magic Fantasy is one hell of a big genre. It will help solve one of my issues--but I get ahead of myself.\nArt:You have disclaimers attached to your intro, but truth be told, I think it\'s by far the most compelling part of your comic. I was shocked when I felt Dark Souls vibes pulse through the screen. The murky recollection of ancient past, the somewhat eerie mystique of the two dead species, the reverence given to the history itself--it works very well, artistically. Sure, the polish and caliber of the lineart is lacking, and is definitely weaker than the last few pages, but once again, the lighting does so much work for you. Maybe it isn\'t perfect, but it does its job, and some of the sloppy line work is glazed over by admirable color and light. I love the intro. Definitely my favorite part. I wish the rest of the comic maintained that kind of grit.\nAs it is, however, the rest of the comic art seems out of tune with the intro. Your art definitely gets better as the comic goes on (for the most part), but it all feels like you aren\'t taking it as seriously--which makes it harder for me, the reader, to take it seriously. The art is more playful and light hearted. The subtle energy you build in the gloomier intro is deflated by the end of the first chapter.\nA number of the backgrounds look muddy. The establishing shot showing her flying back ""home"" is incomprehensible. It\'s a glop of green. Many of the city shots are bland and slipshod, and the fight scene backgrounds are very difficult to understand. The fight scene in general has TONS of character but is hard to follow. Just in general, your comic has a muddy, messy quality outside of the characters that makes it difficult to appreciate. Some more care taken when painting the background--keeping framing in mind--will do wonders.\nThat said, the latest pages are looking sweet. More confident line work, an edge to the expressiveness, more convincing poses, and the backgrounds are getting clearer and easier on the eyes. I think you know exactly what you need to do. At least, your comic is telling me you do.\nWriting:It\'s an intriguing presence--by that I mean the history of it all. I gushed over the intro, but I stand by it. As you mentioned, there are ""lettering problems,"" in that there are quite a few typos. But all in all, I think I have the same issues with the writing as I do with the art. When it takes itself seriously, it kicks ass, and when it strays into ditzy comedy, it suffers. You\'re at your best during the serious moments, which is actually very unique among a lot of creators I\'ve seen. People get spooked by serious moments; they feel the need to ease their own tension by ruining the tension of their own scene. You make that mistake only once, when Flare apologizes to Shade before the fight. Other than that, the intro, the heartwarming scene, the brief moment of contemplation on the tree, and the terror of waking are all effective and draw me in. When Flare is being a silly bitch, I draw back. \nThe dialogue itself is off and on. There\'s some awkward moments in the intro, and there are uninspiring anime-tier quips peppered throughout, but the dialogue never gets in the way. It is good enough, which is a GREAT place to start. I hope Flare shows more than the cliche spunk of the archetypal young-MC in the future. She\'ll need more if Shade is going to play the straight man.\nSummation:It\'s too early--or rather, not enough has happened--for me to make a judgement on the story beyond that I think you are best served by taking inspiration from your intro. The mysticism and historical gravitas is magical. Use the goofy expressions sparingly, as they can easily undermine your serious tone and make it hard for the reader to engage on the level one would want, if a serious tale is your goal. Your writing is starting out at a dime-store manga level, but that\'s a perfectly fine place to start. As more dynamic scenes happen, you\'ll find the rhythm.  Finally, if this is a work years in the making, please make sure you are treating it with the reverence it deserves. That will infect your readers.', ""I think everybody wants to do reviews, but it is time consuming--that turns off 90% or more of the people who have the desire.\nReading your comic now.

Earthy, usually calm, but has its share of serious gut wrenchy moments as well as humor. Some of the early scenes (particularly chapter 2) have unintentional tone dissonance problems, but I'm hoping it's not terrible enough to scare away the right type of readers. \nTarget audience: People who like shades of grey & have a knack for reading between the lines in character interactions. Every main character keeps their cards close to their chests, and thoughts are rarely presented as text, so this comic is written for readers who like to glean the thoughts from the context and visuals instead of seeing everything spelled out. Bonus points if they have experience struggling with language/culture barriers. \nIntentions: My primary goal is CLARITY (which means I'm playing on hard mode, writing an intentionally subtle story...). Some people interpret the comic as some epic adventure tale revolving around the Queen's conspiracy; I consider that interpretation to be a result of a failure on my part.

I also wanted to add that I get the story a bit, but its hard to know what I should be looking for character wise and what actually fits to their personality since there's no description. Plus I can understand the choice of using only a few colors and then different shades of it, but there's times when the red goes over board. Originally I thought it was meant as a shadow or his aura glowing, but later I couldn't quite tell since it kept changing. The story itself feels like you're being thrown in with no context, which is okay sometimes, but you need to give details pretty quickly to help the reader not feel lost anymore, or add it in the description."", ""I edited the question a bit to clarify some things & added CH2 - 6\nI do think i'll tone down the red a bit, that cant be good for people's eyes.and i'll make the text bigger for phones"", ""Okay, having finished ch 1:It's good! I managed to get into it and care at many moments for the character and want to continue the story. Which is definitely what you want for a first chapter.\nThere are some changes you could make to improve the narrative impact you're going for. Sometimes as simple as panel order. I know it's hard to read it like you are the reader when you're the creator, which I guess is why you posted!\nI would change the first panel. The first thing I like to see/experience is one solid thing to hold onto. Perhaps a single emotion of solitude or feeling lost. Their is a difference between not-knowing causing curiosity vs confusion for the reader.I felt confused as to what I should feel in the first panel.I would extend that moment to last more panels to clarify.\nThe strong orange/yellow at the beginning may have bothered my eyes a bit. Maybe have the yellow take up less space by using a darker shade for the background around the character or something? Or different shade for the whole thing?\nHaving 'Major Depressive Disorder' being right on the page in the first scene is a bit like on-the-nose dialogue. It's hand feeding the audience and could be done more subtly, giving the audience clues that pull them along. At the same time I didn't even notice it because it's a block of small words that I definitely skimmed. If you want most of the audience to read something make it easy for them.\nThing in his pocket on page 7 made me curious but if it's cigarettes/lighter it isn't clear because it's a different shade of yellow later.\nI understood what was going on with his approach to the car. Thumbs up.\nOn page 9 the impact of the pregnant reveal is lost. You can either move the last panel forward so he says it before the visual reveal or have him not say anything directly but instead snarky ect. We don't need two confirmations she is pregnant for the reveal page. Just visual or dialogue and probably the last panel needs to be the one with the punch.\nIt's easy to skip a driving montage so page 13 had nothing interesting for me but it doesn't necessarily hurt it either.\nThe colours are definitely confusing to me and you want to know what each one means. On page 14 he takes a breath and centres himself before going in, isn't that good? But you use red to represent it and the event on page 23 and the end fight. And fridge is the thing that starts the red at the end which gives a feeling that the fridge is bad. Which I don't think is what you're going for.\nThere is a confusing cut at the end of the party. But first my favourite moment: The TV comes on, the red comes in and he has an episode, or something. Very cool and I felt it. But I was disappointed when it cut away suddenly to later. I didn't know what happened for real during the events inside his head aannd I didn't know how the party ended. So I didn't know how much of the tv broadcast was real or in his head. Which gave me 2 degrees of separation from understanding, not just one, so I was more confused than just curious.\nI feel like you get better as you go. That blue and red colouring like a glow is cool. And that yellow and blue transition earlier. \nThe different pencil, lack of colour style for the dream(?) is cool. I feel like that is going to come back and we will get more from that. I think it's a good choice for a dream because the extra lines have a fuzzy feel to them. Where the rest of the chapter has solid black lines.\nRegarding skimmingI lost engagement at moments during the end fight. That tends to happen to me either when their isn't a value shift that happens or it isn't clear so I can't feel it.But also certain moments did have my engagement!The visuals tend to be at their best and most interesting when their is a blended mixture like page 44. I also found the plain blue to be fine/good like during star trek.\nOkay, this is getting too long. Overall I'm excited to continue.And I would love a reply about the things that were confusing to me so that I know what I'm supposed to be feeling/understanding."", ""Im glad you liked it and thank you for being so in depth, I never would've noticed a lot of this""]",8/11/2020 12:32,https://forums.tapas.io/t/looking-for-beta-readers-for-my-comic-script/47347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
331,Review Mallory Bash for use in studio pitches,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey, everybody!
So I'm collecting comments, reviews, and the like and assembling them for a page in the pitch bible that will be used to pitch the series for animation at the major studios out in L.A. This isn't a pipe dream thing, haha, I actually have meetings set up, and have been on several in the past. So if you want to help try to get a comic to TV, this would be quite a boon to its success.
For anyone that does review, if you have a comic, I'd be happy to advertise it in a shout-out episode of Mallory Bash!
As far as specific critiques I'm looking for:

How engaged were you in the story, and why or why not?
How interested were you in the problems and adventures of the characters?
What are any problems you see with the gaining interest?
Will you remember these characters, why or why not?
Do you feel like you have a good sense of the world? Does it feel like a real place in your mind?

You don't have to hit all of these, but any ones you feel you can comment on is greatly appreciated! All right, enough talk, here's the skinny:

Logline:""On a quest to uncover the truth about her late parents, a young girl wanders deep into the forest at the whim of a cryptic poem and discovers a world inside the mind of a tree.

Mallory Bash | Tapas
Current Season: ""The Dreaming Tree Saga""

Mallory searches for The Dreaming Tree with her friends to find answers to the mystery of her dead parents.

Comedy/Drama





","[""Well, it's been about four days. The thread has 50 views, and the link has only 3 clicks, so perhaps a good start would be to give me a quick word on how I'm losing people before they're willing to view the comic.\nThoughts?\nEDIT:The original post has been edited to reflect the responses to this question."", ""HiWhat exactly do you need? Also please explain elaborately as I'm a little sleep deprived "", '\n\nDavidPerry:\n\nWell, it\'s been about four days. The thread has 50 views, and the link has only 3 clicks, so perhaps a good start would be to give me a quick word on how I\'m losing people before they\'re willing to view the comic.\nThoughts?\n\nI think a lot of people are looking at the thread and going ""oh god, this is way out of my wheelhouse"". Like for me, this is the kind of stuff I do at my dayjob , or at least an element of the work I do there, looking over stuff to pitch to studios or publishers (I work on a series of books, activities and an animated series being developed with Cartoon Network), so I feel relatively confident, but It\'s not the kind of thing a random student who draws a comic with 50 followers will have a great deal of insight into or the confidence to weigh in on.\nAlso in terms of something in return, I imagine most people would be far more keen for a shoutout for their work or something than one of your psds. Please do not give me a psd. Not because I don\'t admire the quality of your work, but because I...don\'t need somebody else\'s psd. \nI think you are on the right track pitching this for TV because the characters being little kids is always going to make it a hard sell on Tapas. I\'m not a fan of stories about kids. In fact, truth be told, I didn\'t even like stories about kids when I WAS a kid. I\'ve always found teens and adults more compelling in a narrative sense. \nThe problem I see here is that I\'m not sure who this series is for? Generally young audiences tend to like stories about people their own age or a bit older. I\'m assuming from her gappy teeth and build that Mallory is meant to be about 6 or so. But the content of this series is way more sophisticated than anything for that age group. It feels like there\'s a disconnect between these very cutesy, very young characters who are all mugging for the camera with these cutesy oldskool disney or WB grins and the very high fidelity, dramatic art and the slow pace and inclusion of the subtle emotional drama between the adults and the required reading level of the vocab.The key to succeeding in this pitch is very much ""who am I trying to sell this to?"". I can see that the quality of the art itself is wonderful, it\'s really good, and the writing is well-done too, I just can\'t really understand who this is for. I loved the incredibly high quality art and the dramatic tone, but wasn\'t interested in the protagonist or her friends, because I\'m just not interested in cutesy little kids acting all precocious; I don\'t find them endearing or cute.\nI personally think the best way to make this pitchable? Age up the design and personality of Mallory and her friends into twelve year olds and pitch it as the new Gravity Falls, Adventure Time or Steven Universe. Filling that hole in the schedule that those shows ending has opened up, for an artistic, dark, slightly spooky and thoughtful adventure for older kids that adults can enjoy too because it\'s a fun story about kids with a touch of adult sophistication. You can point to those shows and say ""these similar things were successful"" and the execs will hopefully nod and say, ""yes, they were, and this pitch is very high quality, okay, we\'ll give this a shot.""\nOther than that though, the biggest issue I see is that logline. It doesn\'t set up a strong conflict or what the character does.""On a quest to uncover the truth about her late parents, a young girl wanders deep into the forest at the whim of a cryptic poem and discovers a world inside the mind of a tree.""\nIt needs another sentence on the end describing the danger or challenge she must overcome, because that\'s what will hook somebody to read on. The girl finding a magical world isn\'t inherently exciting, even though the place it exists being the mind of a tree is novel, because there are tons of stories about kids who wander into a place like the woods or an abandoned theme park or a haunted house and discover a gateway to a magical world. The real meat of the story is what she needs to do there and how it links with the mystery of her parents, and what are the stakes if she FAILS?\nAnyway, I hope that\'s maybe helpful? I don\'t need anything in return, just do your best! Happy to discuss any points further.', ""How many episodes do you need reviewed. I also have not idea what a PSD is... \nI didnt even know this post was here four days ago. But if I'm being honest  I can imagine why people might not be super responsive. Just like darthmongoose said it could be that this isnt in their wheelhouse or some people are looking for something they'd get in return. Again still dont know what PSD, is I'd assume checking out someone's series might be a start.\nBut you probably want to tailor your pitch a bit. This sounds like a huge milestone for you on a forum full of creators who are also working toward their own. And while people do, do things out of the kindness of their heart. You haven't quite given enough reason to open up the number of reviews you'd get. \n@darthmongoose so you review pitches and series for a specific studio or various studios. Also I understand if you can't answer. Just thought it was really interesting."", ""\n\nAykay:\n@darthmongoose so you review pitches and series for a specific studio or various studios. Also I understand if you can't answer. Just thought it was really interesting.\nIt's actually kind of the opposite. The company I work for develops IP and pitches it to publishers, studios etc. I help make the pitches and I get to see the feedback on them."", ""That's interesting. Are all the IPs developed in house or do they ever look outside for an idea or two?"", ""This was perfect, thanks! I've been having this exact conversation about aging up the characters with my partner, and the common concern from studios seems to be her apparent age, which is 10 (something that looks more appropriate in the latter episodes than the earlier ones, though perhaps still an issue). I was trying to keep them around 10 because I felt that the dynamic between their age and the gravity of their conflicts was a compelling situation, but I may be too ambitious on this point. I'll also take another look at that log line.\nThanks again, this was exactly what I needed."", ""As far as critique, I'd love any comments on the pacing and tone of the comic. Do you feel like the story is moving at a good speed? Any strange or abrupt tonal shifts from drama to comedy, comedy to mystery, etc? And definitely any comments you have on the charm of the characters and how interested you are in them and their adventures.\nWhat draws you in? What keeps you there, or what's driving you away?"", ""Don't worry about the PSD thing, I'm going to change that. I always liked the idea of having a piece of original development work from artists I like, but it's apparent that this isn't the best reward for requesting reviews. A PSD is the original Photoshop file in which the episode was constructed.\nIdeally, read until you lose interest and then critique based on how you felt about the comic. If you don't have time for that, which is understandable, try to at least go through the latest five or six episodes. Thanks!"", ""Got it I'll get back to you. I'll try to comment on each episodes as I go through it."", 'When I send you the review did you want it in this thread or in a PM?', ""The thread will be just fine, thank you! But if there's anything in it you'd prefer the public not see for whatever reason, feel free to PM me the review."", ""Here's fine. I was just wondering what's your preference. I'll make sure to have the review to you by the end of the day. I'm about halfway through the comic."", ""Thanks, and wow! You're powering through it. Thanks for taking so much time so quickly."", ""Well it helps that it's really good."", ""I wanted to preface this by saying why isn't this already a cartoon? I really enjoyed it and I'm not just saying that to be nice.\nThe story is a lot deeper than I thought it would be. My main concern is how one would transition from the lighthearted gags into what is the dream tree season. Since it feels sort of like a genre hop. The story in both season one and two are fun. Season 2 is clearly a bit heavier, the characters are delightful and very fleshed out. Each new piece of information leads to more questions and I really want to know the answers. It's Mallory's story but the other character don't just feel like they're along for the ride. Everyone's got their own baggage and journey, and depth.\nThere's so much heart in this. It's well drawn and well told. There are lot of moments in which you use to art work to display different moments in a way that I thought were really enjoyable. Like the transitions between the two seasons and Ava falling asleep.\nI completely forgot to mention the humor. Not only is it funny but it blends so many elements together without going over the top. There's a time and place for laughter. And one for tears as well. Really great storytelling.\nI will say that I'm not quite certain if this is meant for younger children or for children at a later stage of adolescents. Mainly because of Saki's dream. Other than that the story tends to stay more on one side than the other. So it isn't really a problem.\nOverall I really did enjoy it. I'm gonna be honest I truly believe you made something special. Animating this will bring it to a wider audience who didn't know they were missing Mallory Bash from their lives. Good luck and best wishes. "", 'I think your comic is really cool! And the art is phenomenal--lots of dynamics, lots of color, lots of wonderful painting going on with fun characters and a lot of love.  \nThat being said I\'m not...entirely sure how you\'d write it for a TV show? It\'s not episodic, and fits more into how a movie script would be. But, I\'m sure that you\'ve got some different scripts that you\'re using for that pitch. From the sounds of things you\'ve been there done that with animation pitches and so you got all that worked out. So part of why I didn\'t respond before was because I just figured...the pitch would be soo different from the comic that my opinion here might not...matter? I can\'t really see the television show looking like how the comic looks (mostly because TV animation can\'t afford to be as beautiful as your comic is. You got some really lovely light and shadow that just...I can\'t see being done for animation unless it were at a movie budget.)\nLike I\'m not sure why you need to assemble reviews for a page in your pitch bible from a forum, but if that\'s what this studio needs for your pitch, then go ahead and use my nicest sentences to your hearts content, and I hope it\'s what they\'re looking for. If you need more quotes to fill that page, just hit me up and I\'ll just...give you lots of nice words you can use saying how great your story is. I can be really wordy. \nBut for critiques: \n-I skipped all of the gag-a-day stuff, mostly because I...didn\'t really care about that so much as I cared about the plot. I like reading fantasy, so I\'m here for the fantasy stuff. So thank you for mentioning right at the beginning that it really doesn\'t start until the color pages start.\nYou got your script edited down to it\'s bare bones of what\'s needed for this story (and I like your dialogue and I think it\'s pretty solid), but if I wasn\'t so engaged by the art (which is SO good), I would not have known where the plot was coming or going and probably would have signed out. Stuff just kinda happens, and it happens so fast. You are catapulted into an adventure with a lot of overlapping threads, and I do enjoy the characters and all of that, but there are some things that were like ""why is this happening?"" because I didn\'t really understand the rules of your world. Like I\'m thankful there isn\'t a ton of prologue, but it\'s totally fine to slow down and just give me some establishing background so things don\'t feel quite so random. I\'m really thankful that we\'re getting some more of that lore in the later updates, so I think this is something you\'re already kind of aware of and have been working towards adding anyways. But that was my biggest gripe, and it\'s not that big. I like your story quite a bit.\n-I would say that I was most interested in the adventure of Mallory, which is good because she\'s the main character. I\'m not sure what\'s going on with the Lord of the Flies brigade or Geoffrey the talking Ape. But they are funny, so I don\'t dislike them or anything. I think in part because the lighting and coloring is rendered so beautifully, there\'s this expectation of reality, which is making the absurdism seem more absurd, if that makes sense. There\'s Tex Avery hijinks happening but my expectations is like...so far from Tex Avery because I\'m just loving this glossy rendering on all these leaves.\nLike seriously you are one human and you drew and painted all this? Like man. Man! I love the style going on. Real fluid, real fun, and it has so much animation already. Like generally webcomics try and do the most economical art styles possible to get content out quickly, and then there\'s comics like this that are few and far between that are such labors of love, with the emphasis on ""labor."" I can tell that you have a lot of love for this story and so it makes me excited to see future updates.\n-As far as having a good sense of the world--I went over it before about how I just need more...establishing. But I also have a hard time connecting the forest with the suburb next door. It almost feels like maybe they aren\'t aware of eachother? But then when you meet the Grandmother, she\'s so upset because of things that go back to this forest, that it\'s clear that at least some people do recognize the forest and see how dangerous it is. It\'s all a mystery unfolding, which is interesting. I would love to see more about the history of the people and their relationship to the magic/science happening in this forest.\nbut overall, it\'s just a really unique world that still feels very familiar. The characters are beautifully drawn, the pacing is a lot of fun, and the quality is just really, truly impressive.', 'Thank you. This helps immensely.', 'Ended up subscribing.Wish I had found your work sooner.I think this is a good way of getting young girls into comics from an early age, say for example, tweens.I think the art style is good in a detailed yet minimalistic way.\nIf I had a daughter, I would be reading this with her every night.']",8/6/2020 5:48,https://forums.tapas.io/t/review-mallory-bash-for-use-in-studio-pitches/46926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I understand my comic is kind of for a niche market, so not everyone will be interested in reading it long term. \nI\'ve read through all of your series. I like your simple drawing style with colors to distinguish your characters. I also like your straight-to-the-point gags, especially since I tend to drag my episodes out too long.

I had to google ""air sip"" but maybe I\'m just a bit old and out of touch with some things ', ""Well, I haven't really considered building on the world of capture the flag. It's mainly to keep my readers entertained. To me, the comic itself is a metaphor for things that would not always go as you planned it. It's something that we all encounter in our lives. \nBut as for the reason for the conflict in general, it's in the name of the strip. The flag is the center point of the fighting. Without it, there is not conflict. \nI think I may have gotten too deep on this one.

The only thing that may be improved is the font. the one you have is very thin and since it's pink, like the most of the comic, it kinda blends in.

The prologue is short so there's not much to say about the story yet, though it did still provide a hook to make readers wonder what happened. The artwork has room for improvement. The land in the last panel looked a little flat. I like the night sky and the creature at the end. Your human characters look okay, though you may need to be careful with how you draw their bodies. The character's head and neck sometimes look bigger than the rest of his body in some angles. This seems to also be seen in the cover wherein the boy in the left appeared to have a wider neck compared to his body. With that said your work is clean and consistent. The character's emotions were clearly conveyed which is also great. I struggle with body proportions and backgrounds as well . Overall, you seem to be heading to a good direction.

345,Will you review my opening chapter?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey! I am working to revise my story called ""The Museum"". Will you let me know what you think of the first chapter and if you'd keep reading?
A bolt of lightning from the Tesla coils on the roof crackled overhead, casting shards of fractured light onto the miles of endless steel-enforced levels that created the Stacks, where the artifacts not yet housed in a display in the other wings of the museum were stored. There were plenty of other things Jamie could be doing instead of testing her wings. The Hong Kong team had couriered a vase that supposedly could transform into a raging dragon after an expedition in Malaysia a few weeks prior. She had had a few ideas of where to store it, but nothing definitive yet.
Jamie strapped on the harness for her bio-mech wings and stared off into the darkness above her. This test needed to yield better results than previous tests. The levels disappeared into a cloud of darkness after the first hundred floors or so and continued for what seemed like forever. Jamie wanted, no… needed to find out where the Stacks went. She had been on the roof of the museum on multiple occasions and could never figure out where the floors of the Stacks had gone.
The four oval wings slapped against each other as Jamie started to rise first an inch, then two. Soon her feet dangled a foot off the ground, then two. She was halfway to the tenth floor of the Stacks when a holographic bubble appeared over Jamie’s leather cuff, beeping softly for attention.
Her cuff continued to beep softly. Jamie sighed, continuing to ignore the grading beeps as she inched her way higher. She could imagine the to-do list Rudy was making for her, except he preferred to send his lists via the pneumatic pipe delivery system that covered the whole museum rather that text. Her cuff beeped again. Jamie gulped as she saw that the museum administrator, Dr. Woodhouse’s icon had appeared over her cuff. Jamie needed to go to the computer room. 
She landed softly on the ground and shrugged off the wing harness and logged the flight time into the nearby computer workstation. Jamie squealed in delight. Time: eight minutes, forty-seven seconds. Height: one hundred and nine meters. Today was her best flight yet, though more tests were needed under lab conditions before she would begin outdoor testing with the artifact-generated weather patterns overhead.
The bubble with Dr. Woodhouse’s icon appeared again over Jamie’s cuff. The administrator did not tolerate tardiness with her employees. Jamie wiped her hands on her denim overalls and hurried down the hallway to the main computer room. The metal door slid open as she approached.
""Thank you,"" Jamie said to the air, as she stepped inside the computer room. They had added more chairs to the room, Jamie observed as she headed to the high-backed chair at the center console. There were more tables too. Six chairs now faced the wall of computer monitors.
A single piece of paper sat on the keyboard. It was an internal memo announcing the hiring of six new agents by the end of the month and the announcement of a new curator. Jamie had read this notice a dozen times before. She didn’t understand the board’s decision to hire so many new agents at once. Her friend, Alex, was the last hire two years ago after the unexpected death of one of their agents in France at the hand of a fire goblin.
Jamie looked around the room for Dr. Woodhouse, thought she half-expected Charles, Dr. Woodhouse’s administrative assistant, to appear and give her another list of chores to do. Nothing, nothing except the abnormal silence that always signaled impending doom or that’s what the movies Alex liked to watch said.Jamie plopped down at the main computer chair and typed in her log-in credentials. She technically wasn’t allowed to access the museum’s system from this port. It was one of two ports that had access to the most sensitive areas of the museum. After a handful of artifacts meant for the Catherine the Great exhibit ended up in a frat house in Dublin, the board had banned everyone except Dr. Woodhouse and the museum curator from having access. The only trouble was that the last curator and the assistant curator had vanished almost twenty-five years prior. No one would tell her more about their disappearance. It was just part of museum lore.
“Alright Alice,” she said, as the system logged her in. “Down the rabbit hole.” After a few seconds, lines of code poured down the screen. The ones and zeros formed the shape of a star. Jamie clicked rapidly on the star, banging the mouse against the console table hoping for a way out of this program and to the virtual pinball game that she had programmed a few months back.
 The words scrawled across the screen as the star disappeared. 
“I’m not the curator!” Jamie hollered at the screen, still banging the mouse on the table. “I’m just Jamie… Jamie the intern.”
The computer ignored her, and the next line appeared on the screen. Jamie pounded on the enter key. Suddenly, a beam of light shot into her eyes. Images began to flicker through her mind. It was all there: audio files, video files, sketches, schematics, card catalogue notations; everything. Her brain began to ache as the data continued to rush into her mind and then it all went black.
“Miss Carter,” said a familiar, calm voice. “Miss Carter, are you alright?” Dr. Woodhouse tapped Jamie’s shoulder with a perfectly manicured finger. She had chosen bubblegum pink for her nails, though her suits usually were in shades of purple.
“Huh?” Jamie groaned. Dr. Woodhouse repeated her question. “I don’t know. I guess.” Jamie pulled herself to her feet and looked back at the wall of computer monitors. They were black, not pulsing with secrets as they had been a few minutes before. Now, those secrets were pulsing inside of her aching head. “You called for me, Dr. W-Woodhouse?”
The older woman shook her head. “I did not, Miss Carter. Perhaps, you should pay a visit to Dr. Oh in the infirmary. Your nose…”
Jamie pulled a handkerchief from a pocket of her denim overalls and held it up to her nose. The light, blue-gray material was now spotted with red. “Yeah… I’ll do that.” Jamie ran a hand over the console as she headed towards the door. “Bye, Dr. Woodhouse.”
As the metal door slid closed behind Jamie, as single monitor flickered to life. On the screen, Dr. Woodhouse watched as a beam of light projected from the screen and streams of data ran down Jamie’s face.
“Interesting,” hummed Dr. Woodhouse to herself. “So, Jamie is the one we’ve been waiting for.” *","[""Honestly I read the whole chapter 3 times to get an understanding.I'm not much of a modern novel reader I read american-classics. So, that being said here's my advice.\nThe story has a good plot, I'm assuming Jamie is an agent with bio wings trying to figure out what happened at the museum? \nI'd like to understand their bio world more to. \nI'd also like to know the setting, what time it is, how's the weather, etc. What year is it in?I personally like to feel the atmosphere when I'm reading a novel, it's really hard to get into otherwise (that's just me).\nI would keep reading to see what happens to Jamie.But, I would personally enjoy it more If I could follow along better.So overall try creating more of an setting in the opening, describe your characters. \nThe cliffhanger at the end is okay. I don't know much about these characters to really feel hooked. I don't know if they're a threat or not. So try writing about them from a third person. That would help the anticipation and build. \nYou got something going here, keep it up.I hope that helps."", 'So for starters--- it\'s really interesting! I definitely got ""hooked"" into it (I love sci-fi type stuff). My advice would be to explain all this technology (and the setting) a lot more though, especially for a first chapter. I don\'t really understand what ""Stacks"" are, or what ""artifacts"" this museum holds, or why there\'s a laboratory in the museum. I don\'t really know Jamie as a person. And I don\'t understand the computers or what she\'s doing with them or what the star was, etc. Basically, I just have a lot of questions lol.\nBUT, those questions make me want to keep reading to find out the answers! A little more detail about the world and the museum and the artifacts would be really helpful in this first chapter though~', ""Thanks for the feedback.  I appreciate it.

346,Tell me what you “DON’T” like about my comic,Reviews | Feedback,[],"My name is Imani, I'm the artist and writer of Bleakville an upcoming psychological thriller manga series.I've been on a hiatus so I don't have many pages. I will return when I'm ready.
Since I've been on my hiatus I've completed most of my storyboard for upcoming chapters that I have yet to draw. Until I update it, I would love more feedback. I've gotten a lot of great comments on my story and rarely any negative feedback so, today I want all of you to tell me what you DON'T like about my comic.
It's okay to be as nit picky as much as you what. I need straight up honesty. I'm writing about a controversial topic and I need to know how my readers feel.

Thank you all.","[""I personally don't like preachy comics. It can get preachy, but when its the whole beginning I get...itchy? Like, it makes me wonder if thats what the whole comic will be. \nLove the art though! (sorry can't give a negative without a positive)"", ""Thank you for reading! I'm very self aware of the preachiness as I'm writing. Though I like to think of it more as a monologue. I'm not going to spoil anything but I'll definitely keep that in mind.\nAlso thanks you, it took me years of practice."", ""The art is good. But there is just something about size and propotions. I can't put my finger on it but things looks strange sometimes. Also the art has some blur that should not be there.\nThe story looks good, but even if I can go dark, I find this story too dark for my taste.\nBut I do think that there is an audience for this.Good luck"", 'I\'d say the beginning is pretty hooking and actually very well done, but it\'s also kinda of too much in the face for the beginning and since there\'s nothing else yet (just 10 pages of person telling about animal killing), it\'s hard not to think ""ah, preachy vegan POV is not what I want"". I\'d say I would probably return to it after it will have more pages, because I feel like it has a potential and again, is very well put together and holding me in a nice tension, but right now it\'s not really my cuppa tea.', ""Thank you for taking your time and reviewing my comic. I know what you mean how somethings look a bit out of proportion because I'm going to redo some of those panels. I am aware this story isn't for everyone."", ""I think it's really interesting to do a comic on the evils of factory farming. \nMy big note is that generally when there's a heavy moral like animal abuse, the best way to get it across in a way that doesn't feel like the reader's been handed some political literature is to do it through character. So, Bleak is your lead, right? But it's also looking like he's the narrative voice. What I would do is profile his character a bit more strongly at first - like, have the reader get to know him as a person, illustrate his life - to get prospective readers on side with him and therefore your message a little more. Because as of yet we don't really know him, and while he's present it feels more like he's the narrator than an active character.\nJust my two cents."", 'Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts. I hope you do return when I finish my pages.', ""Thank you for sharing and I agree. I already storyboarded a prologue that will give us a more in depth look into the protagonist.  I can't wait to share it."", ""Hey everyone I'm still open to hear some criticism. So far, it has been really helpful."", ""I don't like  the font being used in relation to the art work and message. It's too round and inviting. It feels like there is disconnect between the two. And, at least for me personally, the artwork is too muddled. Sometimes it's clear what's going on and sometimes it just isn't. You can stand to cut down on some of the effects you use. Your backgrounds are good, but your anatomy could use some work."", ""Thank you for your feedback.

Every comic I review will get a positive review because I'm not here to be mean to anyone, more like make recommendations, but for more long running comics, I will try to give criticism where it seems fitting.

For my first review, a comic I've been following for a while, Fangs and Fright!12 
Update Schedule: weekly and regular
This is for all the urban fantasy fans. This is one of the good ones. Wholesome and not too sappy, but with a good dose of drama that feels fresh. I'm a HUGE fan of werewolves, vampires and the like and super picky when deciding when something is good or not. This comic looks super promising to me so far. I especially love the chemistry between the two main leads so far. It doesn't seem like the creator is going for romance right now, but I would totally ship it. It seems like it's still yet to get to the real meat of the plot, but the set up we get so far has me super hopeful for the future of his one.","['Reading it now. Love the slow pacing and character oriented plot. And I like the contrast between the adorable french kids BD drawing style and the more brutal scenes. Subbed.', 'Did someone say urban fantasy?

The style is very goofy and animated well still being polished in a weird way. The story is about a princess is a kingdom with anthros, humans and blue people (lol). It's a bit of a weird world with stuff you'd expect from the typical medieval fantasy, but also they talk like modern kids and play video games  It's also not afraid, despite its outer simplistic to touch on some more mature aspects of dating while still being light and fun. Definitely something for everyone to try if you're not opposed to a largely slice of life type story (with some twists).""]",3/30/2020 22:25,https://forums.tapas.io/t/monthly-comic-reviews/42399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

', 'It needs work. Chris wants to be a hero but ""why""  is kinda unbelievable since this drive for being a hero would have probably happened in his childhood years regardless of his dad\'s opinions. Even that piece of information about his dad not liking supers is extremely tiny to the point that i thought it didn\'t affect Chris all that much but when he tells Golem that he didn\'t pursue hero stuff because of his dad, it\'s odd. Plus the whole ""wants to be the hero, just cause"" feels empty.\nAnna seems like someone who kinda wanted Chris to become a hero and then does an understandable 180. But the way you presented it made it seem like Anna was against it from the beginning. You should\'ve showed her regret letting Chris go instead of making it seem like it was all his fault. \nThe guild concept is presented well in the beginning but when Golem and Chris meet, it\'s not lengthy enough. Golem should have done more to present the Guild as something serious like the Justice League. Instead, with the short time, it made Golem seem a bit OP and the Guild unnecessary since fights with powerful people like Bruiser can just end quickly despite his upper hand moments ago. \nOverall you do have good concepts but the way you\'re presenting them isn\'t enough. Being a hero for no other reason than being a hero is good but you should\'ve presented the great things about being a hero that makes it such an interesting way of life. Anna seems like a relatable girlfriend to a wannabe hero, but you should\'ve presented her as more concerned and regretful of her earlier support to show her change as a person even if it\'s a simple change. And the Guild, rather the hero concept should be expanded upon, though for now i only see a problem with your fight scenes when supers are involved. You gotta make those fights more ""back and forth"" with a little more thought into each action.', ""This is my first time reviewing a comic, so i'll be having trouble coming up with words to use here.\nThe art style looked exactly like traditional comic books, fitting the super hero theme of the story.

351,Praising Your Comics: Vol III,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey guys!It's been a long time since I did one of these, but I've been feeling really discouraged and the world is such a mess right now that I figured it might be nice for both me and other people to hand out some likes, comments, and positive reviews. 
Before you post, though:


I'm not doing so well right now, so I would prefer to read through stories without strong mature content. As long as mature content isn't the focus of the story and is relatively mild, I will read blood, violence, etc, but I will not read stories with prominent sexual themes or content.
These reviews might be a bit more casual than last time. I am by no means a professional--I just want to give some encouragement and, if it's within my expertise, some tips.
If your comic is long, I will do my best to at least read your first 10 episodes/first chapter and your last 10-15 episodes/most recent chapter with a greater focus on the newer content. 
I will not necessarily be reading comics in their posted order, but I will try.
Please note that I will prioritize comics I haven't read before, but if you've updated a lot since last time, I'll still give it a look!

Here's what I need from you:

Please give me a link to your comic!
Tell me about your comic in, at most, one short paragraph to give me an idea what it's about and what I should expect.

With that, my comic has a mature content warning but that's only because I dropped an f-bomb in the first chapter.\nMy comic is a manga taking place in the far off future. A super-natural mutation of humans were created and became widespread across the galaxy. They became known as space pirates. A galactic regime called Blue Sun which holds dominance over the political spectrum hunts them down in an attempt to rid the galaxy of them to strengthen its tyrannical hold. This story focuses on a particular young space pirate who ironically had something stolen from him. He sets out to find the bounty hunter that did the deed, not realizing the mess of galactic proportions he's getting himself involved in. I wouldn't mind a critique, always looking to improve!

It's really nice that you're doing this.\nSo, if you still feel like it, I did a short comic recently in vertical format--never done that before, I've been pretty strictly page format up until now (in fact the first episode is a different line weight because it was...originally page format, too)--and it'd be nice if you could...give it a quick review of what's working and what's not as far as that pacing goes since it's all new to me.\nIt's a character study about a bard who has an emotional spiral when he gains and loses 2 followers in one day.

If you want to elevate your action scenes a bit more, I'd suggest to play around with perspective and dynamic camera angles a bit more as you continue making more pages; I'm sure it'll give those scenes some extra flair!\nOn the more critical side, I found that some of the panel flow was a bit difficult to follow, especially during action scenes where the panels were arranged as 4 similarly-sized squares together in one larger square. Perhaps playing with some gutters and spacing between the panels will help, along with some more variety in the panel shapes themselves?\nThe humor works really well and doesn't detract at all from what's happening, so kudos to you for that!

Wait Hold Up
Amanda Sy was dragged into space far-far from Earth. She will need all the luck she has to stay alive in this horribly tragic situation! Will she survive? Or will she perish? Or will she find friends to help her? Probably, all lol! Weekly Updates on...





The title is Wait Hold up.Thank you!!!","['Not putting much stock in word-of-mouth, am we?', 'I am not sure what you mean.', ""It's kind of hard to do a in-depth analysis since there are only three episodes but i'll try anyways.\nI think your art style is fine. The anime style for the humans has a contrast with the simpler cute style for the small aliens which does not hurt to look at. Your anatomy is also good. \nThe story so far is going a bit too fast. By that i mean that it is a bit poorly paced. The second episode, despite the large amount of panels and pages feels rushed.\nThis is because this is the first episode the main character is introduced in. And we only learn about her through inner monologue before she is already captured in the same episode. I'd split the two things in two episodes, which would give you the opportunity to make the abduction scene longer and more detailed. And perhaps give the mc some more screentime before she is kidnapped.\nI'd also remove the text notification about the art. It might throw readers off."", 'Thank you! Now that you have mentioned it, the pacing is a problem. Thanks for the feedback again!', ""No problem! I'm glad you found my advice useful "", 'So I read what you have so far I think the concept is interesting, or what I assume the concept to be. However, you don\'t have a lot in terms of content to comment on. You only have three episodes. I can\'t really speak on pacing, characterization, or story, just because there isn\'t a lot there.\nWorldbuilding\nMy comic  has a similar beginning to yours and it shares some of the same problems, though I am changing them. The prologue starts in a spaceship(I assume) above a planet that looks like earth, but has a purple band over it. So when I first read through this, I did not realize that this wasn\'t Earth because there was a yellow sun and red planet nearby. I kinda skipped over the text in this part because the planet looked so similar. Now, the idea may be that this planet is similar to earth and that\'s the point. That\'s fair. But even if that is the point, why have a red planet like Mars, there. Why not have it be a different color? The best thing about fantasy and sci-fi are the amazing possibilities you can achieve with world building and quite honestly, I think this part of the comic falters. I feel like, if this is your goal, to design a planet that isn\'t so similar to our planet would be in your best interest, especially if it has an entirely different name and purple structure around it.\nCharacter Design\nI have an issue with the character designs, this includes the small aliens and the humanoid characters. There didn\'t seem to be a plan involved when it came to designing the aliens, any of them. They individually change appearance from panel to panel, some of them look thrown together. It feels as though, you had the human characters planned, then when it can too drawing the actual pages , you realized that you didn\'t have any aliens already sketched so you made them up on the spot. Now maybe you didn\'t, but that\'s how it feels to me, because I\'ve done something similar before. Onto the human characters. I have to say, there\'s little to no variation in body types. This may be a matter of skill level for you but to me, they all look like they ave the same avatar base with different skin tones, hairstyles, and eye colors. Their silhouettes are only variable by their hairstyles. A very important part of character design is silhouette, or the ability to differentiate characters if you black out the character and look at external lines. You always want to give you characters a unique(if not interesting) silhouette so they stand out among other characters in general and other characters in your story at least.\nDialogue\nLet\'s move to the dialogue next. It\'s a harsh read for me. Other than what\'s actually being said, you didn\'t add tails to the speech bubbles in the prologue so I had to guess who was speaking. You don\'t want your reader to do this, because above all when it comes to comics, clarity should be your main focus. It doesn\'t matter what is going on on the page, if the reader cannot understand or cannot follow what is going on, they will put the story down. Onto the actual words being spoken, The second line spoken in the prologue has a typo/missing words. What\'s said is ""My greatest pleasure to tell you that we have found the irregularity in planet earth, my liege."" (this is the line that reinforced to me that the first planet shown was planet earth). \nThis line reads awkward. Things are out of order, words are missing, and the grammar is incorrect. It sounds better as.""My liege, it is my greatest pleasure to inform you that we have found the irregularity on planet Earth""Since the language is formal, \'inform\' is a better choice over \'tell.\'Other dialogue is stilted and unnatural like the conversation the MC had with her coworker. Why was * sad face * in a speech bubble? Did she say it? Why were there asterisks? That threw me off.The conversation between Cora and the MC was weird. One, because Cora had very stilted dialogue. Now I get that she was supposed to be speaking formally, but there is a difference between formal speak and improper grammar and a not using contractions( don\'t, we\'re, weren\'t). Now if it was explained or introduced that aliens, in this case Cora, only understand a little bit of English and speak in a stilted way because they\'re not from earth, then you would have an excuse. Also, the MC\'s reaction to Cora asking her to rebuild her planet was minimal and very controlled. If I lived a normal life working part time for college money and got plucked into the sky and told I had to rebuild a planet, you bet my reaction wouldn\'t be as subdued as hers. Lastly, the exposition moment in the third episode. Initially I though it was you, the author, tell me, the reader, what irregularities are, but them I realized it was Cora. This is something I mentioned before, not informing the reader who is speaking. It doesn\'t matter if Cora was the only speaking before, when you change the font of the text, the reader is automatically going to think someone else is talking(or the emotion behind the words are different but that doesn\'t apply here). As a tip, read you dialogue out loud or have someone else read it before you finalize it in the comic.\nArt\nI\'m not going to get into a long diatribe about your artwork, not because there isn\'t anything to mention, but because it\'s obvious to me you\'re still relatively early in your art career and any changes I mention are mainly skill based and will come to you with time. But for now, the color palette of the comic is all over the place with characters (mainly the aliens) and pieces of lore being brightly colored and interesting to look at, but the backgrounds being bland and dreary. There a lack of cohesion. I don\'t think these characters fit into the world you have built. Cora and the MC look like they\'d fit better in a shoujo manga rather than sci-fi manga. That\'s isn\'t to say their appearances couldn\'t work, it\'s just that for me, they don\'t work here. The backgrounds can also be messily done, like in the scene in the parking lot when MC was going to her car. The coloring was messy, but that\'s not the issue. If it was just the colors, it would have been fine, but then you put lines on top. And with the colors falling out of the lines haphazardly, it didn\'t like a purposeful decision, but a rush job. I also agree with @DualDragons, you don\'t need those blurbs at the top of the episodes, nor do you need to return to the prologue and episode 1 to remake the art. Mainly because you haven\'t made a substantial amount to difference in the styles; they don\'t look that different. And  I think your efforts are better suited for moving on with the story. \nLastly, I haven\'t been calling your main character by her name because it hasn\'t been mentioned in the story, and from the look the progression I can\'t tell if it will. I can infer her name is Amanda Sy, but for all I know, I\'m wrong. It shouldn\'t be the title of an episode, but in the story. It\'s very important for your readers to connect with your characters, and the best place to start is with a name.\nThank you for reading this and being open to criticism I hope this helps! I did have more to say but others have mentioned them in a more concise way. Good luck!', ""I think the pacing is okay. Even for 3 chapters , I am following along fine. MC is an average girl, with an average life.MC seems to have a lot on her plate. She is important to others and she has people who are important to her. She gets abducted and is told she has some sort of higher calling, things get interrupted, there's a battle.  \nI can understand how mayb some people see this as it moving way too fast but at the same time that's how the MC feels and I'm not sure that is necessarily a bad thing. You could add scenes where we can see more of what is at stake for her( Like scenes with her brother or something a long that line). You could even add more scenes where Cora and her team are monitoring her more and maybe hinting why they need her to come with her right now and not say, in a week's time. But I'mnot sure what you have written or where you plan on going after this so it may be a little to early to say if these things are needed.\nAlthough I think what happens after this battle is what is really important. Say the MC is just taken by Cora and the adventure begins. If that was to happen, and I only say this because that's kinda how it feels at the moment, then it makes the beginning chapters feel a little pointless. Why bother explaining her troubles at home if shes just going to leave kind of thing? Though maybe you have some kind of solution to that problem, if that's the case. Other than that you will need to find a way to clearly show us why the MC is choosing to do what she is doing. Whatever choice that may be. And that's all the advice I can give with what you have regarding the story.\nAs far as the art, my biggest critique is the alien designs. if they are robots, I wouldn't say they all need to look alike, but their design should be related to their function. An example would be a healing robot has characteristics of a doctor like a stethoscope or a syringe, things like that.\nOverall I think you're off to a good start. Keep going!"", ""Thank you so much! This is very in-depth. In art, I was thinking of doing cartoon then anime but I'm more comfortable with anime. I do see that the art style of aliens/robots vs humans is off-putting. And oh my god, you are spot on with aliens being rushed. I only decided what they looked like when I was about to draw them lol. What is your comic, btw?"", ""Thank you. I'll try to put the scenes of what at stake for her if I decide to revise. And for the aliens, I actually decided what they look like when I was about to draw them. Also, things will happen more in Earth before they move forward with their journey due to Amanda's responsibilities! Thank you again!"", ""Hi! I've read your comic. Now, as others have already pointed out, I would remove the text about your change in style, it's ok if you are changing your style throughout the series so don't worry about it. \nNow I don't think the pacing is wrong, but there are a couple of scenes where it is difficult to follow what's happening. Like when this character, Vicky, appears. Since I can't see where she's standing it is difficult for me to identify where she came from or where she's standing from the MC, maybe you can add a scene where we can see both next to each other just to make it more clear for us. \nYour artstyle is fine, but there are still some anatomical problems that make some scenes look quite akward, more specially the ones involving foreshortening (like when Cora is flying). Maybe you can help yourself with some references to help you with those because drawing foreshortening is pretty hard,I know the pain myself hahaha\nAside from that, I really like the details you made for explaining the hexer stone. Maybe you can use more of such an aesthetic for your comic to make it stand out even more because it looks very unique and interesting.I think the story is interesting and would love to keep reading more of it in the future \nI hope my short review is of help to you."", ""You're Welcome!

Birdy | Tapas
Birdy, a successful PI, has a secret: on any corpse, she can see strings leading to a killer. Her mystery solving proves difficult when she stumbles into the scene of a murder framed as a suicide.





","[""Hello! I’m always down for being reviewed and reviewing!\nChapter one:\nOverall I liked it! I think you do a solid job of describing what’s happening and there's a good sense of plot, the premise is also interesting and fast paced. I'm sort of a stickler for realism, so if something I say doesn't apply because you have a scifi/fantasy thing going on feel free to disregard it!\nCharacters:\n\nYour description paragraph of Birdy is very long. It might be worth trying to describe her in more detail as you go instead of all at once right up front, but this might just be a preference of mine. That being said it does paint a very solid picture of this character and her personality!\nYou don’t necessarily need to go into Birdy and Drew’s entire backstory right up front, it could be more interesting for the reader to piece it together through some telling dialogue. You could leave the introduction to what their relationship is and how their powers are useful to each other/motives for working together. If this backstory bit isn’t very important to your character's development/current relationship or the plot then it should be ok as is.\n\nGeneral:\n\nIn the first chapter you call the dead boy “the dead boy” twice pretty close together. Depending on the tone you’re going for I think using the word corpse could be very impactful here if you wanted to replace one of the “the dead boy”s. Especially since Birdy seems to be pretty unaffecting by death and treats it like a job she doesn’t get paid enough for.\nThe first scene is a little confusing just because I’m not sure what Birdy is doing in this location in the first place, so at the end when she suddenly has a coffee and is ordering another to go feels weird. There might need to be some indication earlier on that she came out of the cafe to inspect the body?\nThis might be just me, but I thought her powers were through her phone. Like, she can only see the red wires when looking through the camera display on her phone. It might be because it doesn’t say she puts her phone away, or that it was a quick photo for evidence.\nWhen you get into scene descriptions they are very detailed and paint the environment nicely! The words you chose gave it a grungy London but in the sunlight kind of vibe.\nI’m not sure what you’re referencing with “...like in one of those bad movies where someone strange sad man uses bodies instead of investing money to just buy a larger doll, saving effort and probably prison time.” but it sounds interesting. If it’s a specific movie I’d like to know!\nWhat is the * in the middle for? There's only one so it’s not a seperate backstory scene, and it doesn’t represent time passing?\n“Everyone needed a motive to die and less to kill.” I don’t know if that checks out, could you explain what you mean?\nJust as a side note, it usually takes at least 3 stories in order to die from a jump, but landing on the head from any height could do it. If the head hits first though you wouldn’t break your legs. If they land legs first it’s less likely to be fatal. I don’t think you need to be 100% accurate to real life at all, especially since you have scifi elements, but ~the more you know~\nYou say fuck, but also crappy instead of shitty, and it’s a weird shift in tone. Commit to the swear!\nThe idea that you can’t stop a death from happening has a lot of potential, especially if you’re following, like, final destination type rules.\nDid the people in the cafe not hear him hit the sidewalk when he jumped? It's pretty loud, especially if bones break.\nThe premise you set up is cool!  A murder made to look like suicide is pretty insidious if you go for a moral perspective on the perp!\n\nMine is also a murder themed one! My chapters are split up into parts because they're usually longer than tapas's word limit. I never know what to put for trigger warnings, so let me know if i should add anything.TW: violence, gore, drugs, foster system\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nBoil Frogs Slowly | Tapas\nA foster kid gets put back into a boys home in a small town where he reunites with old friends, and a few new ones.

I've only read the first chapter, but here's what I got for you!\nYou're very good at imagining exactly what you want your scene to be and then putting it into words. Your images are very poignant. However, they come at awkward times, making your writing seem a little stilted. Instead of giving us description in between every piece of dialogue and every action, save it! Do a little bit of set up-- we'll forgive you for a little bit of narrative description. We want to be able to read the dialogue smoothly.\nThat's my main critique-- my other is that you might want to brush up on your use of commas. Just look up some grammar tips and go through to make sure that everything's being used correctly. Some of your sentences just have too many words in them! Remember: you're not just going for images, you're not just going for correct grammar: You're going for concise. You want your images to be crisp. Each sentence needs to be as short and as clear as you can possibly make it. Each sentence is its own work, in a way. If you've never read Ray Bradbury, I advise reading some of his stories to see what I'm talking about! Every single one of his words is perfectly chosen. He reads like poetry, and I think we should all aspire to that.\nAlso, your title is incredible. Just amazing. It makes me want to read more.\nAll right, here's mine!Content warning: future episodes will contain horror, attempted/implied sexual assault, and fantasy violence.\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nThe Innsmouth Girl | Tapas\nEvelyn Marsh is one of the last inhabitants of the dilapidated town of Innsmouth.

I will give you some crits and comments stream of consciousness style. Here is my series: https://tapas.io/series/Heart-of-Vampire3\nChapter 1:Good hook. Your prose is really nice. I like the pictures that go with your dialogue, pretty unique touch.  Very well drawn. I will say the waking up/it was all a dream opener is a bit overdone. Not that it's particularly a bad scene or anything, but I think dreams are better in the middle of a novel since we have a better clue as to what they indicate. Are Evey and Edith the same character? A little confusing/jarring, but only atm. Hope to clear this up in the next ch. I'm glad you are introducing conflict in a mission right off the bat. Getting Fire Emblem vibes.\nChapter 2:The cyborg horse threw me. I thought this was medieval or Victorian, but now it's cyber-Victorian. Pretty cool. The dialogue and world specific jargon is good. A few infodumps here, but they are not lengthy and not jarring. I'd like to know more about the inner workings of Edith/Evey's mind and why the mission is important to her. The motivation here is a bit unclear. Comment not crit: Is it normal to go to a town square and shout the name of the person you want to talk to? It's probably not the best way to go about things. I guess it worked for Edith though. The pomp and formality that Edith speaks with is good character stuff. I hope she doesn't give lofty titles with each introduction though, that may become tired. (to be continued)"", ""Chapter 3:Ok, so the story is picking up. Cool goggles, Alan. We are learning more about the covey, their goal, and how they operate. I think you have a diverse set of characters here. I think giving them alone time with Edith in later chapters will help flesh out their personalities. I think you did a good job of ramping up some suspense with the negative reading of Barnes.\nChapter 4:Not much to say here. You do a good job at casting suspicion upon Barnes and the town itself. Nice sensory details here and there. The hunt for the fiend continues.\nChapter 5:Another good episode. So, Edith is a badass. Does she perhaps have a thing for Alan? Ooooh... I think that the dialogue is good, but the scene kind of drags a bit here. Not a lot, but a tiny bit. I felt the same way in previous chapters. You are doing a good job illustrating what I'm assuming is the covey's daily struggles/a routine mission for them. I expect either that this mission will turn out to be more than they bargained for. If not, moving forward I would ramp up the stakes with a more difficult task for them. \nIn summary, it's a really solid start!

It has been a while since I read Dracula, but I seem to remember he and his daughters had no reflections, could scale walls in a way that defied gravity and a few other supernatural powers? The vampires in my story can't do that. They have increased physical abilities as they are a more nocturnal and predatory version of your average human. Vampires can turn a human into a vampire by injecting their blood, or making them ingest it. Injecting is the more effective way to do it, as seen. The story is set in WW2. Only the allies use vampire WMD's. The Nazis see them as an impure race, but they have their own WMD's.

Your writing is good, it\'s clear and well paced.Two problems did I have with this piece. Main one is that hat last part where the protagonist speaks from his first person - it seames quiet unneccessary. It does\'nt bring much new to the story and basically just repeats things already established by the narrator. Also sudden switch from third person narration to first person feels a bit confusing. I think, putting this bit into begining of next episode would do the better work - it\'ll help to recap the intro, and then we would just have the begining of another character story, allegedly within the context of Alto Cadea\'s narrative.The second thing (maybe I just didn\'t get it right"" is that bit where he takes count of how many days it\'s been since him leaving... I understand that this serves the purpouse of establishing the time frames, but it feels a bit heavy-handed here: you don\'t need to bring up a full calendar entry to count two days since day before yesterday. Also isn\'t is says ""Day2"" on his ""diary entry"" when speacs of leaving?

The blockiness and the saturated colors give me a whole Cartoon Network kind of feel.\nOne problem I have with the art is the lack of variation and dimensionality to it. The 'camera' is almost always looking dead-on at the characters, never from below or above or any other angle. This can make scenes with just dialogue uninteresting to look at, since it's just back-and-forth panels that look very similar.\nThe story itself has a big dramatic hook- fate of the world and all- but I think it cuts to the chase a little too immediately. Characters are introduced all at once, in big groups, and then immediately they all go to one place, and more new characters, then another, and so on... It's hard to digest and the pacing feels off. Since there isn't much buildup to each event or introduction, sometimes they can even feel random.\nOverall, it's a promising start, and I see how a story like this could have broad appeal.

I love getting notes!"", ""First impression is that this comic looks very professional. The art is very consistent and extremely detailed. Fans of manga would generally be big on this, considering the art style and black-and-white screentones. You may want to consider taking advantage of the digital format by adding splashes of color here and there (such as, making magic colored in your comic) unless you're formatting this for print.\nAs for the story- it cuts straight to the chase. I read up to Sion part 8, for reference, and at first I was a little confused since our main characters (Keith and Jeremy) were given no backstory or much context. They do reveal their personalities as the story goes on, which is nice, and obviously showing is much better than telling when it comes to character traits. But the beginning was fairly disorienting.\nOut of curiosity, I skipped to the beginning of Sigrid to see if they'd be given any history then, but nope. The fact that a 13 year old and 11 year old are solving supernatural cases together does raise a lot of questions, though- where are their parents? Are they getting paid? How'd they get into the profession?- that readers naturally expect to be explored. I'm not sure if you're planning on giving these questions answers, but it's something to consider, especially as it would help ground their characters."", ""This is one of the more unusual comics I've seen. For context, I started with Omega Lad and skipped around to see more examples of your art and writing.\nOmega Lad was hard to to follow. There were many things happening at once, often with panels from both events being placed side-by-side, making it even more confusing. The art is densely detailed, and colors immensely saturated, giving it an old-school Marvel Comics kind of feel that I really like. But it's too much information happening at once. I would suggest toning down the saturation of the colors and aiming them in one direction (for example, making everything bluer or warmer) for more visual cohesiveness. Having a more linear storyline would also help.\nSkipping around to your more recent chapters, you seem to have fixed a lot of these issues by having mostly black-and-white with spots of color. The text boxes are bigger and aren't crammed together, which really helps readability. Your art as a whole has a very defined aesthetic. The last thing I'll say is that you may have a rough time attracting a consistent following, since anthologies, by way of being anthologies, will have different appeals for each story, thereby having different 'audiences' for each. But I wish you a lot of luck."", ""That's fair enough and thanks !Keith's mom is introduced in Sigrid and Jeremy's dad in the third story, and their respective backgrounds are explored a little.

","[""Something that immediately came into my mind is how saturated some of the color was, and then the shading came to add to it. It could be better. And the background makes the whole thing looks too 'packed', if you know what I mean.

I really like how you lean in fully into your middle eastern influences. \nWhen I was reading your comic there were two areas that I would have liked to seen done a bit differently. Firstly, you use a lot of bright saturated colors. In scenes where there is multiple people or multiple characters it makes it hard for the eye to figure out what to focus on because everything is grabbing my attention. So I get a bit lost in the picture. \nSecondly, sometimes you have really large blocks of text which kind of remove the momentum of the comic. Plus, since these large blocks of text tend to be on the side or the bottom I spend more time reading the text than looking at your cool artwork! Since this is a comic, I think you should try to find ways to interweave that information in more comic story driven ways. \nI can tell you put a lot of thought in the world and even in the first few pages it feels like this is a universe with history and people with complex motivations so keep up the good work!', ""UHM so that eye definitely scared me so mission accomplished! hahaha. \nAnywhoo nice first chapter! At first I thought it was a bit too mundane for something that should be feeling creepy but the second I thought that you ramped it up so I enjoyed that. Personally, I would've liked the text to be a bit bigger since it was hard for me to read at times. Also make sure you are really conscious of readers reading left to right because sometimes the characters would switch sides and that wasn't immediately known. Also this could be personal preference but don't feel you need to hold back with Harper's friend's disbelief. It could make for a really interesting dynamic. All in all good work!"", ""ooo you have improved a lot!

This is a bit of a nitpick but make sure your text is properly centered in the bubbles. This took me out of the story a few times. This could also be a style thing but I would have like the outlines of the people to be a little more pronounced. Now it doesnt have to be lineart or anything but just a bit heavier so I can clearly differentiate between the objects on the page since there is no color.

The art direction is really good and everything is super clear. The genre you wrote in is definitely not one I like to read and yet the quality of your manga made sure I wasn't turned off. If anything my biggest criticism would be the details for your comic. Make sure you fill that out! You've put too much effort for people not to click because they don't know what it is about.\nAlso this is not a huge deal but on the first page right after you scare us about the blood mages, you mention Dion likes to help people. I personally would have left that out because it lets the reader think well... we just learned how scary blood mages are and then wonder  if Dion is good or bad.

362,Offering Comic Critiques! [CLOSED: GO TO THE NEW THREAD!],Reviews | Feedback,[],"To celebrate hitting 100 subs on Errant, I want to help people who are struggling to hit their sub targets (or just to generally get better) by pinpointing areas to improve and offering ideas and resources where I can.
How to get a review:
I collect submissions in batches of five, then I pause while I review them, then I open submissions again. I don't do free private critiques.
Please read the rules before you post asking for a critique:

I'm only reviewing comics. No novels. There are other threads doing novel reviews.
Please nothing with less than the equivalent of five print pages. If you're coming to me saying ""Why don't I have 100 subs yet!?""  and you only have a cover and two pages, my response is, ""it's because you only have two pages.""
I may put taking reviews on pause if I get a big influx so I can catch up.
I am going to point out flaws in your comic. There is no such thing as a comic without flaws; even my favourite comics in the history of comics have flaws. I will be fair and polite and I will offer constructive advice and keep in mind what is actually reasonable to expect of a person, but medicine doesn't always taste good and I totally empathise with that, it's okay to go away for a few days and to feel upset and process it before you respond. You don't have to agree with my observations or suggested solutions, but please don't waste my time by asking for advice to build the popularity of your comic, then say ""well I don't care about popularity, so I'm not changing it! Nerr nerr neerrrr! "" Take it like a grownup. Only put your comic forward if you are genuinely open to the idea of potentially changing things to improve it.
If you're aware of a flaw or you need to explain some extenuating circumstances that have caused your comic to not be as good as you'd like, or you want me to focus my critique on a specific aspect (like writing or art or a specific chapter) feel free to let me know. 
If a comic's content is particularly upsetting, creepy or explicit, I reserve the right to not review it. I'm a sensitive person about that stuff, and I don't think I'd do a good review if I'm upset by the content. If somebody else wants to review a comic I've declined to review, go for it, but please be polite and keep to the constructive spirit of the thread.
If I've reviewed your comic on another thread and you haven't made a decent effort to change it since then, I'm not reviewing it again.
If you want to jump in and add advice about somebody else's comic I've reviewed to supplement my comments based on your own expertise in certain styles, media or genres, please be polite, positive and constructive. This is a helping thread, not a dunking thread.

I understand you\'re currently on hiatus (and I\'m really sorry for the circumstances. My thoughts go out to you and your family), so it\'s a good time to take a break from the comic grind and spend a bit of time studying, planning and thinking about your comic, so you can come back with fresh eyes and some new tricks.\nSo the first thing to say about Royal overall is that a lot of what I\'m going to bring up is stuff that you have clearly been taking steps to improve on since the comic started. You\'re on the right track with things, so a lot of the advice should feel expected. \nStarting out with an easy fix: Spelling. There are a lot of misspelled words in this comic, like ""summoning"", ""volcano"", ""sandals"" etc. If you\'re lettering in Photoshop, you can actually fix this incredibly easily. Go to edit > Check Spelling. Otherwise, maybe type out your dialogue into a google doc, then copy-paste to your bubbles. It\'s only a little extra effort for the big boost to how professional the comic will feel.Some neater speech bubbles would also add some professional polish. Personally I like to use the shape tool in Photoshop to make nice flattened oval shapes and drop them, along with tails, into a shared layer folder with the folder\'s blending set to a stroke. It\'s flexible, quick and looks nice and neat.\nMoving on to the Art...\nOne of the things that stood out to me, particularly early on during that period where the comic was in black and white, was that it was a bit of a struggle telling the characters apart and remembering who was who. The cast has a lot of slim pale skinned guys with medium-short hair dressed in a t-shirt or shirt and full-length slim fit trousers. That doesn\'t necessarily have to be an insurmountable problem, since like... yeah that describes the cast of a lot of shoujo manga like Ouran High School Host Club. The art style has a nineties shoujo look that feels influenced by comics like Saiyuki and Gravitation, so looking closely at how mangaka you\'re influenced by differentiate characters could be a good place to start. Try to think about different physical builds, posture, face shapes. Even when the cast is all fairly young and trim, there can be a fair bit of variety in terms of bone structure, muscle mass and definition, where the muscles are, bodyfat amount and placement. This is a good example8.\nClothing fit and material also makes a big difference. You can get across a lot with how loose or tight a t-shirt is, and whether it\'s tucked in or not, and similarly with trousers, there\'s a distinct difference in silhouette and impression between dress pants, khakis, jeans, chinos, drainpipes, combats etc. Obviously your aim should be for all of them to still feel like they\'re in your style, but see what you can do about expanding the variety of the cast and how you show the differences between existing characters. Throwing in some more female characters and variety to the skintones when new characters turn up would be a really straightforward way to make the cast feel a bit more varied visually, but I think right now there\'s a bit of a problem with having a lot of characters, so adding more may not be ideal until some existing plot threads are resolved, so concentrating on refining designs already in the comic might be best.\nThe other thing in terms of the art is... you probably knew this was coming and have been dreading it, it\'s backgrounds. I can see a distinct increase in the quality and detail of the backgrounds as the comic goes on, but a little more work would really help add a professional feel to the comic. Don\'t be afraid to use reference. For towns and cities, google streetview can be remarkably effective for this stuff. You can go to the kind of place you want to reference in google maps, plonk yourself on a street and BOOM: reference, get! When drawing indoor environments, look at photo reference or observe from life for details that really help sell your scenes, like skirting boards, light fixtures, door frames and door handles, shelves and what\'s on them, furniture and flooring materials. Adding a pinboard full of posters and notes to a school hallway and some scuff marks on the floor can add loads of character with relatively little effort.\nOn the scenes where there\'s just a panel with a character, consider using some light patterns, texture brushes or noise. Sometimes the soft gradients feel a bit empty and also a little early 00s looking.\nStory thoughts:\nAt times, I felt like there wasn\'t a strong impression of the overarching narrative, or even who the main character is and what their arc is supposed to be. The comic is named Royal, but at times I really felt like Oliver was the real main character. He seems to get just as much, if not more screentime early on, he has more dedicated and threatening antagonists, romantic tension with hot vampire guy and the battles he\'s been in felt like they had higher stakes. This does seem to have improved later, with Royal getting a couple of strong action sequences and a mystery set up with this ""Lane"" person. I think trying to tie the plot threads together and setting up what Royal\'s main motivation is will help avoid the kind of problems that plagued ""Bleach"" where every time the mangaka got stuck for story, he introduced new characters to try to put off the problem of a protagonist with no particular motivation or overarching goal he could achieve.\nThere\'s a bit of an issue with scenes constantly being interrupted by other scenes that makes things feel disjointed and keeps killing tension buildup. If the scene you\'re cutting away to has nothing to do with the scene that was cut away from, it should be left til the end of the chapter like one of those Marvel after credits scenes. During an action scene, cut away only if what the other characters are doing is going to impact that battle, so something they\'re doing or saying explains or foreshadows information about the battle that ramps up the tension (ie. revealing something the character fighting doesn\'t know, like their opponent has a poisoned knife in their boot! Or their opponent is actually their dad! Or showing a sniper overlooking the battle from a rooftop as she raises her rifle and puts the hero in her crosshairs...).\nI\'d also advise trying to keep the number of characters in scenes, and just in storyarcs generally, smaller. For one thing, it\'s easier to draw when there are fewer people in a scene, but it\'s also easier to follow on the reader\'s side. If a narrative role can be fulfilled by a character who already exists, and even better, who is already in the scene, so long as it\'s reasonable for them to be there and they could reasonably have the knowledge and skills to say or do something, have them say or do it. Sometimes a new character turns up and it bogs the plot right down with things that other characters could probably have done. ie. The principal introduces herself over the phone just to tell Royal about the challenge, then she\'s never seen again. We\'ve met a bunch of other characters, including teachers who probably could have done this and saved time spent introducing somebody.\nOverall, it\'s a comic that\'s clearly been improving over time, especially in terms of visual storytelling. Hopefully these pointers help give you some direction for continued improvement.', ""Oh, how exciting! uwu Here's my comic if you have time. It's kinda new, but there's nothing too explicit or violent in the content. \n\n\ntapas.io14\n\n\n\nInfinite Nights | Tapas\nLong ago, a dark gloom overtook the sky and brought upon the land eternal darkness. It's said that defeating the Lich Prince will bring the darkness to the end, and bring the Heroes who do it great wealth and fame...

I did that with my drawing request threads', 'All right, here we go with Mercy: Freedom.\nArt thoughts:\nThe speech bubbles use the default digital art program oval tool shape, which is a pretty common amateur comics mistake that tends to look unpolished. If you can use shape tools or similar to make the oval more inflated, less pinched looking, they\'ll look better.\nspeechbubbles.jpg1024x919 119 KB\n\nI\'m not a massive fan of the 3D modelled look of the comic. It\'s not terrible, but it does tend to feel quite stiff and cold. There are a lot of panels of characters staring straight on at the camera with a sort of... serene, neutral expression. This does improve later on with more drawing being done over the faces, and it really helps. More of that, and anything you can do to try to make those poses feel less stiff would also make a big difference. Rotating the figures to be stood more diagonally to the ""camera"" rather than always straight on or in profile is a good way to add a bit of dynamism and depth to a scene.\nThere\'s a lot of narration used in this comic, and at times I sort of feel like this is really more like a novel with pictures than ""sequential art"". There hasn\'t been a lot of panel-to-panel visual storytelling to get across actions or transitions. Panels are often copied and pasted, and the narration carries a lot more of the storytelling and emotional weight than the visuals. Combined with the fact that so much of the visuals are done using 3D models and premade brushes rather than drawing, which makes the art look very bare bones and low-effort, at times it came across as though the art was an afterthought, done without much passion and perhaps that this was made into a comic because comics tend to get bigger audiences than novels, but really you actually wanted to write a novel.Maybe that\'s not the case, and you\'re passionate about comics, but feel like you don\'t have the skills to draw from scratch, but overall, I think your aim should be trying to inject as much life as you can into the comic to balance for how stiff and robotic 3D models can be. Adding a bit of warmth to the skin shadows, drawing in some lines where the 3D model renders have missed them, drawing over faces more and also putting in some research into how folds on clothes should look so that the clothing sits more naturally on the characters and the soft furnishings like curtains that you draw in by hand look more believable would all boost the overall quality of the comic.\nStory thoughts:\nI just read this comic for about an hour to get through the archive and finally now something surprising has happened in that a character grew wings, but there\'s still been no central conflict established. I\'ve never felt like Mercy was in danger of having her power revealed, or got a sense for what the stakes could be if it was. The people around her all seem so nice, why should the reader feel worried for her? There\'s no antagonist, all the characters are falling over themselves to make it clear the captain just seems scary and he\'s actually awesome, everyone else is super nice and supportive, and the main character has no clear motivation or large obstacle to overcome. These are things that I\'d definitely prioritise fixing. \nThere\'s a lot of telling rather than showing going on, and the plot moves both very quickly and very slowly, more like a novel than a comic, with a lot of time devoted to explaining Mercy\'s new life and her learning to speak and write and meeting people, but a huge amount of the development is described, rather than shown. An example is that Mercy keeps telling us the captain is intimidating and she\'s scared of him, rather than being shown an example of him looking scary or doing something she misunderstands as looking threatening, causing her to cower, hide or run from him. Similar examples would be her getting to know the squad. Mercy\'s power is actually a bit of a pain for a comic because she has the power to just know things about people and tell the audience, so there\'s very little on-panel character development and a lot of Mercy telling us facts about them that could have been nice facts to learn organically from seeing those characters interact.\nOverall, it\'s not a bad comic, the prose quality is very solid, the characters have consistent voices and it\'s consistent and competent. It just needs a bit of... spice in terms of the visuals and story to liven it up a bit.', ""You're absolutely right, I'm a writer first, and wanted to try my hand at comics because I went to school for art, and got really interested in the idea of making one. I'm still clearly learning, you've absolutely picked up on that!

I have recently did that with a crossover project im doing with a couple of friends\nother than these, the rest are things i definitely have to work on ', ""Okay here we go, here we go go go! It's Five!\nI uh... actually don't have anything negative to say about the story on this one. It's actually a solid setup for a manga-style story, it's pretty well-paced and the writing quality is very solid so far. The protagonist is likeable with a distinct personality and the supporting cast feel fleshed out using extremely efficient visual storytelling.\nArt stuff\nThis comic is pretty close to a pro standard by the time it's out of the prologue. The colour palette is pleasant, well thought out and consistent, the style is distinctive, with a bit of flavour that evokes Hiromu Arakawa and Kiyohiko Azuma (oh no, two of my faves... must try to remain unbiased...) while still feeling like its own thing and the visual storytelling is very strong. Big props on pulling off pages with no dialogue, that's some confident comicking right there. So we have a strong base to start from here, and a comic that just needs a bit of a push here and there.\nSometimes it feels like the figures are all quite similarly chunky. Like there's a 6 year timeskip, but I didn't feel like there was a difference in the appearance of the main character during that time to give me a sense of them presumably aging from a small child to a teen (particularly throws me off because they dressed more like a teen in the bit before the timeskip with like... cool boots and stuff, but then after the timeskip they wear dungarees and a cute backpack like a small child), and everyone in the cast has the same sort of build. That's something to work on a bit, as well as trying to be a bit more consistent and clear with the height differences between characters.\nRough speech bubbles in places could do with tidying up particularly because they don't always match the clean lines of the art, which also tends to have thicker lines than the delicate bubbles, and I think the font is a little flowery for the art. It's a very cute font, but it looks like it belongs in like... an inky indie slice of life comic or a graphic novel adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Something a little more suited to an adventure manga with shounen looking art I think would fit well. It doesn't have to be too macho, just a little less curly maybe?\nPanel gutters are inconsistent in width while being in a single page rather than long-scroll format and it feels a bit thrown together because of it. They're better later than in the pre-timeskip part, where some of the gaps between panels are very big, but there's still inconsistency there and some panel gaps that feel too big creating a slow move between panels where you actually want a snappy transition, and sometimes it feels as though you're prioritising making the panel layouts interesting over having them do their job effectively. Sometimes a simple layout done well that lets the storytelling and art shine is best.\nSometimes there's a little bit of skimping on the environments and leaving things flat or empty that with just a little push would add a bit more professionalism to the finished product. For example, if where pavement- er, sorry, sidewalk (defaulted to British english there haha) wasn't flat and at the same level of the road with a sort of roughly hatched few squares, but had a nice raised kerb and the flagstones were offset, and if the corners were curved, like on a real kerb, it'd just add that extra polish that comes with evoking real things and add depth to the environment.\nOverall, this is very strong and it's on its way. You got this."", ""\n\ndarthmongoose:\nOverall, this is very strong and it's on its way. You got this.\nJust jumped on this... Your right. Love it @AbelDraws"", '\n\ndarthmongoose:\nPlease nothing with less than the equivalent of five print pages. If you\'re coming to me saying ""Why don\'t I have 100 subs yet!?""  and you only have a cover and two pages, my response is, ""it\'s because you only have two pages.""\nDespite this, would you be willing to crit a single page?

","['Hi,I had a look through your comic  . I honestly love the colors of the panel 10 of ""A Lonely Boy"".

Their personalities/expressions comes across easily through their facial gestures and speech-bubbles.Although as of right now I have a hard time grasping the story, these two seems to meet by chance and keeps bumping in to eachother between flashbacks.

373,Praising Your Comics: Vol II!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Because I can't edit my old thread anymore and it's getting pretty long, I decided to make a new comic praising thread. I hope it's okay! I also added some more details for future posts.
*I plan to continue going though the comics that I missed in the old thread; however, because it's been a while, I will give priority to people who also post their comics here to show that they're still actively requesting reviews.
Here's what I need from you:

Please give me a link to your comic!
Tell me about your comic in, at most, one short paragraph to give me an idea what it's about and what I should expect!
[New] Tell me if you'd only like praise, or if you would also like a critical review. As my main purpose here is to encourage other creators, I will only do a critical review if you explicitly ask for it. However, I'll be sure to balance each critical point with a positive one. If you have anything specific you want me to look at, let me know!

But! Just a few things to keep in mind before you post your comic for me:

As far as mature content is concerned, I will read blood, gore, violence, etc, but I will not read stories with heavy/moderate sexual themes or content. 
My preferences for genre are, in no particular order: horror, fantasy, adventure, action. I'm doing these reviews for my own entertainment as well, so please understand that I will prioritize these genres (but I will still read comics that don't fall into these, so don't think I won't look at all!)
If your comic is quite long, I will do my best to at least read your first 10 episodes/first chapter and your last 10-15 episodes/most recent chapter with a greater focus on the newer content. I'll be trying my best to read your entire comic, but I really do want to get through as many comics as possible while still getting my own work done.
I will not necessarily be reading comics in their posted order, but I will try a little harder this time to do so.

I\'m mostly starting with people who posted here who also posted in the previous thread before I move on to new folks. \nHere we go!@dwopey\'s Divine Daughters1: \n\nThe way you introduce the characters at the beginning works really well, and they develop in unpredictable ways that are refreshing in this type of comic. Rather than just being happy-go-lucky magical girl fare, you go into depth about how these powers impact their lives, and I appreciate that.\nI like the way you both follow and defy tropes and the expectations a reader might have, such as alluding to how strange it is that these girls are talking to ""themselves,"" the villain at the beginning interrupting their introduction, and the general ""personalities"" that are attributed to magical girls of certain colors.\nThe quips and character interactions are fun and remind me of Saturday morning cartoons, but with a little more depth than the average. I love depth in characters, so I like this.\nIf I have anything to be critical of, it would be the speech bubbles and text. For the text without bubbles/balloons, sometimes the text blends in to the background, so a little more contrast or a border around the text might help. I also think it might help to give the text within the balloons more room to ""breathe""; for example, there were several panels in which I couldn\'t easily read the text because it spilled out of the ""balloon"" area and was cut off. How I try to work around this problem is sketching with space for the text already planned/actually paneling and sketching with the text already there (since you\'re working digitally, this shouldn\'t be too much of a hassle), so you\'re already allowing the speech enough space before you even start drawing.\n\nThe story is fun and the characters have depth beyond just ""magical girls save the world,"" so I think it\'s an exciting story to follow if nuanced magical girls are your cup of tea!\n@PixelEnchanter\'s Finley Myself: \n\nBefore anything else, I really like the title; I love puns and wordplay, so that immediately caught my eye.\nYour comic is nice because it offers some good representation for people who share these experiences, or might still be questioning their own identities. For people who have those similar experiences, they\'re relatable tidbits that resonate with others who likely feel they aren\'t often enough represented in this world.\nAs for people like me who don\'t share those experiences firsthand, I think it\'s beneficial to share your experiences also to help educate people to understand those perspectives and better support them.\nI like how they\'re short episodes that say just what they need to without feeling excessively drawn out and losing the reader\'s attention.\n\nThe comic says that it\'s autobiographical in the description, so I think it\'s great to have a place where you can share those experiences in a clear way and really express them for other people to understand! They\'re relatable, and if not relatable certainly understandable, tidbits that I think work really well!\n@KidJake\'s Rabble!: \n\nWhen you shade the pages, I really like the contrast in the tonal values that make things pop in the monochrome; since the comic is monochrome, I feel like those values are all the more important and really work for you when you use them.\nGood job with the backgrounds; I can see that you\'re really trying with them, and that effort is certainly paying off!\nI think it\'s interesting how the two main characters seem to be foils to each other, especially at first. They\'re totally different people financially, socially, and in age, but you also choose to parallel them in panels to emphasize that contrast between them.\nThe story certainly takes a more realistic tone than most ""people with superpowers"" comics do, focusing instead on the downtrodden and how time doesn\'t stop for people just for the sake of the plot.\n\nAll in all, it\'s an interestingly gritty take on the superhero genre that doesn\'t shy away from showing a perhaps more realistic portrayal of what would happen if random people got superpowers--especially people who might not have the best intentions or morals. For those who are interested in those darker takes, then give it a look-see!\n\nKeep up the great work all of you, and thank you for letting me read through your comics and give my two cents!

374,Review train! We keep the train going by reviewing each other’s stories. (Rules at top),Reviews | Feedback,[],"I see a lot of plugging threads, but most people have the habit to just plug and leave. Which is understandable, nobody has time to sift through the dozens of comics that appear on there. but it does cause a lot of frustration when you plug there and nobody clicks you.
That's why I suggest starting a review train! The concept is simple:Step 1: Review the previous poster's comic and one poster's comic of your choosing.Step 2: Plug your own comicStep 3: Get reviewed.
That way, everybody who plugs is almost guaranteed to get read at least once.
A couple of rules though:1. You MUST review twice before you plug2. You may plug multiple times, but you must always do two reviews first3. You may choose to skip the previous poster if there's a content warning.4. The first responder on this thread only needs to review one comic5. I have to review at least two comics after the train has started. When the train starts to lose steam, I close the thread and try to review the comics that didn't get any yet. Then we can start anew (if it actually worked)
and finally, but importantly6. Be honest, but be kind. If your opinion is negative, try to put that forth in a constructive way so that the author can improve rather than lose self esteem.
Have fun and I'll (hopefully) see you in the train! Don't worry if someone posts after you've started working reviewing the previous poster. If someone still hasn't gotten a review by the end, I'll try to cover for them, and they might already get one before then.
You're allowed to review something that's been reviewed before (It's inevitable), but keep an eye out for people who've been skipped. A review may cover any aspect of a comic you think worth mentioning. (story, art, lay-out- English...)
(edit) Oh, and one extra detail: Try to mention how far into the comic you've read before your review (do read more than one page though, give it a good shot)

Oddy's Office | Tapas
When Odette Oddington acquires unreasonable amounts of debt by way of a flaming bird exploding her car, she is drafted as a general assistant for an interdimensional multimedia corporation run by the Lord of Darkness.





","[""Series being reviewed: “Oddy’s Office” by liamhernandezlucas\nI’ve read through the whole comic.\nYou have a strong introduction that immediately sets the whimsical tone of the series:    • A pigeon race: It contrasts with a physical setting that’s very much reminiscent of real life.    • One of the contestants catching fire: Nice homage to Icarus.    • Just so happens it crashes into our main character’s car: Followed by an exaggerated explosion    • The pigeon lives: And now Odette’s gotta pay its medical bills.And this whimsical tone continues well into the rest of the series, although it slightly falters off during the tour of the building. But I think it’s a necessary trade-off of getting Odette (and by proxy, the audience) acquainted with the world. And the cartoon art style only helps elevate the story’s whimsical nature.\nAll the characters have all made a really strong impression from the get-go. The story hasn’t been going on for long, so there’s not much to differentiate them from each other. But I am invested, and I think that’s what you’d want in a start. \nI only have one critique, and it’s the inconsistency of Odette’s reactions to what’s happening to her.    • Her fear of the lawyer and her situation establishes something about her character.    • Meeting Lucy and Paul has her freaking out, which is consistent.    • But her reaction to meeting Sara seems a little muted. But she is starting to acclimate.    • And then her reaction to meeting Harry throws that acclimation out the window. But then she’s suddenly okay with it a second right after. Seems like just a gag thrown in for gag’s sake. \nThere’s a lot of smaller things I think are fun, like the meta things, but what I’ve written above addresses the biggest strengths of your comic. To conclude, I like it! It’s still early, with only the introductions being made and no real plot progression yet. But it’s a strong impression, and I think you’ve accomplished everything you’ve set out to do.\n\nSince the first poster only has to review one comic, I'm free to plug in mine. Right?\n\n\ntapas.io6\n\n\n\nAegis | Tapas\nSamrose Reese is a newly-promoted detective of Aegis, the international law enforcement organization of the mythical world of Mylur.

The transition between the first and second episode threw me off for a second, as both characters have brown hair and the first panel only shows the top of one character’s head without a good shot of the background to give the reader a grounded feel for where all is in relation to one another. A panel like this would be fine later on the comic when the reader is more familiar with the world and characters but it did take me out of the story for a second. You do a great job with setting the world and scene with page 5 and the transitions flow well and I like how you put detail into your backgrounds and play around with angles to keep it visually fresh. After the first page there isn’t a whole lot of action or tension provided to pull readers in but the visual backgrounds and flow of the character’s journey helps lead the reader through the story in the absence of more developed conflict.Your panel flow gets better as the story goes on and feels very natural. However, by page 10 there is still not clear conflict or a lot known about the main character that creates some distance between the story and the reader. Your art shows great leaps and bounds of maturation from the pilot to the most recent pages. I would recommend capitalizing on your obvious talent for panel flow with more strongly establishing character and conflict to make it clear to the reader what the crux of the scene is, the motives, and what the story has in store to keep the reader devouring the comic you have so well mapped out with your paneling.Let me know if you have any questions or elaborations, I am always happy to talk comic shop and I hope this was helpful! \n@jcmraz  Runner: Nice job setting the story with a balance of showing and telling. It’s quick, painless, and lets the reader know right off the bat what this world and your comic is about. Your character’s motive is made clear right off the bat which is excellent for grabbing attention. Chapter 0 Page 4 has fun angles and action that is eye-catching and gives insight to character and abilities. However, most of your panels have a straight on view and I think that sacrifices energy that could be present in a comic that has a lot of physical action. Consider trying more dynamic angles particularly for sequences like panels 1-6 on Page 5 that would breathe that much more life into a humorous moment. You have more experimental angles starting around page 30 and I would encourage you to keep that up, it makes a big difference in the visual engagement. I also like how lighting is played around with more in the later pages.Don’t be hesitant to exaggerate or go the whole nine yards with the action poses. The movement looks less stiff as the story goes on and the comic could be that much more visually compelling with a bit more elasticity in the character’s movements.You do a great job of establishing character and relations on Page 6. Overall your pacing in terms of character presentation is spot on and one of the strongest elements of the comic. Well done. \nSame thing for you, my friend, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to chat comics and the like!\nNow I must humbly submit for review (it's lengthy so no, I absolutely do not expect a full review, but a look at the first couple chapters would be appreciated  ):\n\n\ntapas.io6\n\n\n\nLegio Arcana | Tapas\nLegio Arcana is a contemporary fantasy webcomic about those who fight the things that go bump in the night.\n\nJoin the Legion with a new page every Friday!\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""@liamhernandezlucasFor Oddy's Office, I like it so far. I think the writing is good a humorous. I like Oddy. Her personality is interesting because she's the type who goes along with things before realizing the gravity of the situation; she's a bit naive, friendly and straightforward which is a great contrast to the absurdity of her situation. Here reactions are inconsistent sometimes. Initially I was under the impression her reactions to mundane things are overblown, while her reactions to absurd things is muted, which I think would be a funnier dichotomy. Now for the art, I won't say it's bad but I do see a lack of confidence in the line work. Once you tighten up the lines, flesh out the backgrounds, and work on things like perspective, I think the feelings your trying to translate will come across a lot better. It's an interesting premise with a lot of appealing aspects. Good work!\n@Hexigate I think this fantasy mystery has a great start with and interesting premise and a world worth sticking around to learn about. It has a slow start though that might be because of how the website is now formatted. I only read the first chapter but looked ahead and it seems like your artwork gets better and more defined. Though I will say, your back grounds in the pilot chapter were very well drawn including the cover page and the street scenes. I will say the action was pretty stiff in the first chapter but it probably gets better as the comic goes on. Overall good stuff!\nMy comic isn't too far in, and I do plan on redoing the entire first chapter.  I'm in the middle of a short hiatus but I hope others enjoy.

I read up to page 7 of chapter Verdana. yeah. I started  binge reading like a madman.\nSo my thoughts on this:\nThe characters:Great character work. Sam is an incredibly likable protagonist, and you give every character just enough detail both in their dialogue and body language to make them feel like real people. It also helps that all of the individuals Sam interacts with have their own flaws, biases and oddities without having them be needlessly mean spirited.\n The story:This thing reads incredibly easy, and the pacing is really well done. The start may be a bit slow, but the intrigue of what this world is and what Sam is investigating is enough to make it feel a lot shorter. I also have to applaud the fact that you're trying to handle bleak subjects like murder, racism, prejudice etc without losing a sense of heart. mild spoilers Having the bartender survive the attack was unnecessary, but gives a much needed sense of hope. That Sam made a difference. Showing small acts of kindness between Sam and others and how much these people care about the world around them, it gives nuance to what could otherwise turn out an unpleasant grimdark story.\nThe WorldThe urban high fantasy setting feels unique and well crafted, giving the reader enough information to follow the story and enough questions to want to find out more.\nThe ArtYou start very strong with different angles and detailed backgrounds. This quality stays throughout, but there's also an improvement in the panel layouts and a stronger sense of lighting as the story goes on.Of course, the larger changes in art style are very noticeable.\nThe rough linework and painted colours make everything feel a lot more tangible than manycomics that value cleanliness over atmosphere.\nThe two biggest ones are the addition of noses and the change in character models.On the subject of the noses: I thought it was fine without noses, and seeing the noses suddenly added was strange, but it does end up working better as your style accommodates it.\nThe character model change is a bit more jarring, especially because you have such a strong sense of character design, so the faces and expressions of the characters really stood out already before the change. However, the new models do very well fit the style and even though they take getting used to, I feel they were a bold and positive decision on your part.\nThat being said, I do feel the need to emphasize that your art style is already as good as it needs to be. This is the kind of thing I could see printed in a comic book store. I don't think you should try and make the images look too realistic. Sam's cartoony face and the simple stylised designs help sell the expressions in a way that realism could not. It makes the characters more empathetic and the world feel alive.\nOne last thingBy all means, this comic should have a very large following. 85 is definitely significant, but it reads like something that should've hit the thousands by now. I guess luck plays a large part in this, but I do think that if you can sell people on your strong sense of lighting and character design in the cover art (since tapas will be allowing book covers soon), that you might attract a larger audience.\nAll in all, a great read."", ""Here's the second one.\n@jcmraz You're not very deep into the story just yet, so it's difficult to get an idea of the story's themes or the characters'personalities, but it's a solid start. I read the whole thing.\nSo, my thoughts on this:The charactersI like what we've seen so far. The bald runner is awesome and I hope he gets a lot to do, because he's like the perfect mix between a serious mentor figure and a downright meme. I mean, he's a muscular bald jogger that kicked something five times his size into the air and it exploded. What?!\nThe girl is the protagonist, I'm guessing. So far, she's likable. I tend to dislike the cocky 'I take runnecessary risks and I'm proud of that' or 'I'm the newbie but I'm always right' characters, so her first interaction with her team made me worried she'd be one of those characters, but she quickly leaves that category by actually making an attempt to work with her team and listen to the more experienced runner, so props for that.\nThe third character hasn't had much to do yet, so i'm curious for his future\nThe StoryWell. there hasn't been much yet. It has a good start, and it leaves you wanting for more. The action scene was also well paced and you get a clear overview of what each character is doing at any given time, so that's a definite bonus.\nThe WorldThis is probably the part that makes Runner stand out the most. This concept is both unique and amazing. The idea of messengers treading through dangerous territory is as old as society itself, but dressing them up in modern sports gear and giving them abstract magical powers, now that's a combo I haven't seen before. It makes for a very interesting aesthetic and I am curious what exactly these 'mana wells' are capable of.\nThe Art.The art is definitely a strong point, but also the point that could use the most improvement. Soft shading could help establish a sense of depth in your scenes and characters, as I felt that was mostly what was missing. This is very noticeable in panels like the last panel on page 5. Playing around with angles a bit more could help during action scenes, but I feel you are doing that really well as is.\nI think your story could benefit from a little more stylisation. This is most noticeable with the faces, as they tend to change proportions from time to time. This improves very quickly, but I do think some experimentation with drawing the faces in ways that feel natural to draw without thinking about realism could help solidify the style. \nBesides that, the characters have very emphasized muscles and anatomy. I think that's going to be one of the most important aspects of the art, considering the sportswear aesthetic. Here, some more stylisation and exaggeration could really help set the characters apart, rather than trying to draw them as anatomically realistic as possible.\nThink of popular comics and manga, notably Dragonball, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Baki... Some of these are known for having really well drawn muscular figures, but when compared to an anatomical chart, some things wouldn't add up. Because they're exaggerated in their shapes and proportions, they feel realistic without being so.\nI do think you're definitely on the right path with this, with a lot of thought going into the poses and shapes of the characters'movements. Like on page 25 panel 2. (The faces also work really well on that page). On the same page though, in the last panel, the character's arm seems a bit off. Exaggerating the perspective of the punch and the swelling of his muscles and the size of his fist could mask smaller errors like that.\nAll in all, a very strong start and very promising."", ""@rmdooleyI'm currently reading through Legio Arcana. It's dense in plot, so I feel like I'm gonna have to read a bit deeper into it to make a proper review. I do like it a lot so far."", ""@rmdooley This is a good read! I've read the first chapter and I've checked a couple of later pages. I was especially surprised by the black and white aesthetic. Manga and older comic books commonly have black and white, but it has a very different feel to it. Legio Arcana feels more like watching a black and white film than reading something like a manga. I think this has a lot to do with the harsh contrasts.\nSo, my thoughts on this:\nThe CharactersThe characters don't need a lot of time to make an impression. After the first chapter, I already felt like they were fully fledged people. That's not easy to do. The standout here is definitely Marianne, but the other characters do quickly distinguish themselves.\nThe StoryThis one can be a bit difficult to read because it's heavy on dialogue. However, that is not really a weakness as much as a matter of genre. The dialogue is very well written after all.\nThe first few pages are very confusing, with a lot ofinformation and a lot of interaction that promptly skip over the exposition. Again, this may be a barrier for some to get into a story, but I think it's a necessary sacrifice for the genre. Reading the first few pages feels like jumping into a long running tv show in the middle of season 3. There's a whole history, but all the characters are already familiar with it. Though the end of the chapter does imply more will be explained later on. As for the themes and direction of the story, I assume these are adressed in the later chapters. But chapter one does function well as a stand alone story.\nThe WorldChapter one introduces a lot of interesting concepts into this world. It quickly establishes the ideas of magic being real, as well as that it isn't commonly understood. There's also a lot of emphasis on the differences between 'life magic' and 'death magic', and that these witch hunter characters aren't completely adverse to the idea of magic as much as its misuse. I'm intrigued to learn more.\nThe Art\nThe art is very well drawn. Varied use of angles, good sense of poses, recognisable character designs...The black and white aesthetic works really well. At first, the harsher tones of the dark clothing contrasted with Marianne's light fur felt too extreme, but you quickly get used to it. My only complaint would be that the faces sometimes appear a little stiff, but this is also easy to get used to and it doesn't distract from the story that much.\nA bit difficult to get into, but very rewarding. Great work!"", 'Thank you for the review! This is very informative. Do you think having the speech/text be bigger would help with the readability along with tightening the dialogue?\nI know there are a number of transitions in the first scene, would having the labels of the time and place (four days ago at the Burke vs presently at the University District help)\nFacial expressions are difficult for me, it is something that is being worked on, thank you for bringing it up.\nI sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback, it is has been extremely helpful', ""I'm glad to be helpful! \nI think timestamps and locations aren't really necessary. It's fairly clear when you hop from one scene to the next. Most of the confusion in the first chapter stems from simply being unacquainted with the world, and trying to puzzle together which character knows how much, what exactly the role of the supernatural is etc. It's a side effect of introducing characters who are acquainted with the supernatural before emphasizing that it isn't common knowledge. But that's fine. I think it's something you shouldn't worry about too much.\nI'm sure the facial expressions will improve with time, and I already found them pretty good as it were.\nGood luck going forward!"", 'Who we running train on today?', ""I'm not sure what exactly you mean, but @IndigoShirtProd was the last person to plug and hasn't gotten a review yet, and the rules for the train are in the first post."", 'Ah, thank you for the clarification! Your time and input is a light in these dark times ', ""@IndigoShirtProdI've read the first chapter. Your comic, The Black Belt Society immediately strikes one with the unique art style! The simple shapes are used to create distinct characters. Especially the goddesses are amazing, I seriously enjoy their expressions and personalities being tied to their elements, which are immediately eminent from the first second you see them. The style can, however, perhaps get overly expressive, in a few panels they can be over the top, looking crooked or uneven - try to keep in mind that making your comic visually appealing is just as important as making it unique. The text bubbles are always placed well, they look extremely professional. The dialogue itself could, however, use a bit of work - the characters use each others names all the time, this isn't really common in the real world, think about how often you call your friends by their names at the end of a sentence when talking to them. I LOVE the color very very much, it looks super neat and everything is well placed and refined. The buildings are interesting and unique, I can imagine your story being turned into a tv series. The movement is fluid and dynamic, full of action. Great job!\n@Hexigate I've read the Pilot and a few of the later pages to see how you have improved. Your comic, Aegis, is extremely appealing because of the differing shots. It never looks stale or boring. The characters each look distinct and with a pleasant design. This also ties in with the colors and background, which are very beautiful and easy for the eyes. I love the muted color palette, I think it works well for the story and the tone of Aegis. However, the art style itself could use a bit more work, especially the lineart. It gets better as your story goes on, but it can still look messy and unfinished, a bit too blurry for how refined each of the color is. The characters can often blend into the backgrounds because of this - a more refined outline would definitely help this. This would also make the very contrasting, bright and thickly outlined text bubbles stand out less - they don't exactly fit in well as of right now. The story is super interesting and I will definitely finish it later!

Oh Shut Up! - My Life With Auditory Hallucinations | Tapas
Exactly what the title says. Life while dealing with the demons I call Marcus and Lucy.





","[""Reading the webcomic I would say it's very funny and a bit random but in a good way. The only issue I mainly had was reading some of the words. Maybe you can try a different font to improve legibility. Overall very interesting storyline dealing with voices in one head. I have a thread on my webcomic feel free to respond on there."", 'Thanks! I left a review on your thread ', 'I think the concept of the comic is something that can connect with a lot of people. Even if they don\'t have auditory hallucinations, they may have negative thoughts weighing on them. This is a good creative outlet for this so I commend you on that. \nMost of my issues are with the look of the comic as opposed to the writing. For the way the dialogue looks, I can tell one of two things: either you have poor handwriting or the correction/stabilization is turned up so high when writing that it\'s making all of the words hard to read. I would recommend using a font, dafont.com and fonts.com are great free resources for finding free to use fonts. I don\'t know what drawing program you have but most have a text feature. If you insist on writing the dialogue yourself, then take the time to practice writing, probably with just pencil and paper. Once you build up enough muscle strength and memory, it\'ll easier to write legibly. \nI understand that the art style is supposed to be simplistic and your likely early in your art journey, but spend more time on your sketches. I feel like you\'re the type of person who draws one sketch and is fine with it. Something that can help with that is looking at other creators and also practicing drawing humans from real life. If you look art other creators even on tapas, while their figures are simple and the colors are limited, there is energy and form in what they draw. And I\'m not talking about action creators, I\'m talking about those in your genre, slice of life. I can tell you want people to make an emotional connection with your work, but it\'s hard to pick up n that emotions if the characters are stiff, the poses are static and the expressions lacking. It\'s alright to have plain backgrounds, but if they\'re entirely vacant, readers will have a hard time placing characters. It might be a good idea to have a landmark or indicator of when Lucy, Digiyeen, and Marcus are just in Digiyeen\'s ""mindscape"" without an outside interference.\nThere\'s a lot more to be done here in terms of the art work, but that\'s how many people start out and it\'s nothing to be discouraged by. It just means it gets better from here. The concept is good and I see a lot of interesting avenues this type of comic could go down.

A few people have said I need to work on my handwriting, so it looks like that’s gonna be my main priority for right now, but I’m definitely gonna work on the stuff you mentioned like spending more time on the sketches and making the poses more dynamic.\nOk so the first thing I wanna say is that I love your art style. Normally I’m not one for bright colors and sharp edges, but your style has this charm to it that I can’t explain. I don’t know, I just really like it. \nHowever, there are a few issues with the art, in my eyes at least. One of them is the characters’ eyes. This is just my personal opinion, but adding pupils might help with expressions and make them look a little more finished. I used to draw my characters without pupils, and I remember wondering why they always looked like they had a piece missing. \nAnother one is the poses. I think you could make them a little more dynamic. I’m sure you’ve heard of the line of action, and how bending and curving it dramatically can help with the feeling of motion. There are also times where the characters look squished, if you know what I mean? Like their proportions are squeezed down so the characters look wider than they’re supposed to.\nFor the text, you have a readable font (unlike me lol), but the little pieces of side commentary that aren’t in text bubbles can be hard to read. I recommend putting them in their own little bubbles or making the text all white or all black depending on the background they’re in front of.\nThat’s all I really have to say critique-wise; I hope it was at least a little helpful . I really like this comic so far, and I’m looking forward to seeing more!', 'Thanks I appreciate the critique!', ""Well, I have a review... Hum, I feel kind of cruel to do it, but, we all learn about negatives reviews, so... Here I come  The comic is hard to understand because the type of letter, that annoys me and stops me from keep reading it, maybe it's your style, but for me, it's annoying because sometimes I have to guess what it says. So I'm sorry, I hope not to be rude or cruel. I would like to keep going but I have to keep guessing what it says sometimes, it's annoying, I'm sorry. If you could find a font that mimics your style it could be better, at least from my point of view."", ""I would love to trade reviews!\nYour comic has a fun premise. The dialogue flows and the ideas of each strip are definitely relatable to a comic-creating audience. The nagging doubts and insecurities voiced by Lucy and Marcus are well done and the ‘Wrestling Match’ episode did the humor very well. The interplay between the three characters grows stronger as the comic goes on.The text can be difficult to read at times but that’s an easy fix. And a few episodes feel rushed, like the dialogue and humor wasn’t given enough room to breathe and develop (So You Have Chosen Death) and read like it was an inside joke I was missing out on or were missing a final punchline to wrap it all together (What’s So Funny). Humor is difficult because it is situational and ridiculously subjective but the subject of the comic is relatable to readers and will appeal to people who have a bit of an edge to their funny bone. \nLet me know if you have any questions or want clarification, always happy to talk shop!  \nAttached is my webcomic which could always use some good ol' feedback!\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nLegio Arcana | Tapas\nLegio Arcana is a contemporary fantasy webcomic about those who fight the things that go bump in the night.\n\nJoin the Legion with a new page every Friday!\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""I like it!

Honestly, I don’t have much to say critique wise about the art. You have a grasp on all the fundamentals, and I don’t really feel qualified to give you advice on how you can make it better \nFor the story, the beginning was a little confusing. The jumping in between the scenes with Tim and Oden and the joggers was done well, don’t get me wrong. In fact, once I got further into it it made a little more sense, but while the dryad attack and the rescue of the joggers was actually happening, I had to go back and reread it a few times because it felt like I hadn’t quite picked up all the pieces of the story. But that’s a minor thing, and overall doesn’t really impact my comprehension of what’s going on.\nSometimes the pages can get a little text-heavy. I understand that dialogue is important for this story, but when the pages become so cluttered with text that it feels like I’m looking more at letters than drawings, it kind of takes me out of the story. I would work on finding ways to cut out some of the fluff in the dialogue, and leave only what’s absolutely necessary. \nHonestly, that’s all I have to say. Like I said, I feel kind of under qualified to be giving you a critique, but hey, I said I would review people’s comics so that’s what I’m gonna do  \nI hope this helps in some way, and I can’t wait to see more of Legio Arcana!', 'Uh thanks?  Is there any other critique or constructive criticism you’d like to give?', 'Thank you for the review! The feedback is incredibly helpful and you are absolutely right, I am going through to trim the dialogue, make it bit more streamlined so readers can get their questions answered sooner (and also make the speech bubbles bigger)\nAgain, thank you for giving the comic a look (and subscribing!) \nI really appreciate it and look forward to any and all feedback you can bring to the table!

","[""At first glance, it's nicely written and the art is very good, and you get to the point with the plot very quickly! However, one big problem that I noticed is that you're making this comic in scroll format, yet your episodes are split up in pages, which makes going through them extremely meandering. This actually worked in old Tapas with eternal scrolling, but now that we have to click through every single one, a suggestion might be to try and merge old episodes in 4 or 5 pages. Though it's up to you if you want to risk losing some comments and likes - I've seen it done before, but not often and not in smaller works."", ""I'm going to try to check it out a bit later and hope to have constructive criticism then."", ""Thank you!\nYeah, I actually thought about the formatting before. This is how my old one was, and this is what I prefer - but I understand that's not for everyone. So I started to re-format to be scrolling-friendly here on webtoons: https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/our-forever/list?title_no=3887971Your suggestion seems also good, but I'd hate to lose the lovely comments :S"", ""The art and flow is really good, I've just checked out the first five episodes.\nThe issues I find with it are within the lettering and tangents. \nI would firstly recommend using a font that's more typical in manga or comics. SF toontime is pretty alright, but there's definitely better ones out there. Also, some speech bubbles have the text too close to the edges, it would be great to give them some breathing room. \nPersonal opinion but I would be careful with cursive fonts like these \nimage.png1580x314 472 KB\nthey can lower readability, especially if their colours don't contrast with the background.\nUsing curving or longer speech bubble tails and directing more to characters' mouths is also something I'd like to see more in your comic. \nI'm not sure if you're familiar with the term 'tangents' in comics but this is basically when lines touch when they are better off intersecting or not touching at all, and the effect disturbs composition a little bit. I see this mainly when characters' horns are cut off by the panel edges, I think adjusting this to show the full length of their horns with enough space would be great!\nGood luck with your comic! It looks like it has a lot of potential!"", ""Thank you for reading my comic!\nHmm yeah, me and typography aren't great friends haha. I'll try to keep it more readable. Luckily those really cursive fancy fonts are only few and far between.\nTo be honest I thought I was staying clear from those tangents... whops seems I wasn't careful enough. Thank you for pointing it out!"", ""Yeah, typography and tangents can be pretty tricky!\nI'm not as good with tangents as some more experienced creators. But as long as you keep the body parts of characters from edges (except maybe the bottom edge), it's all good!"", ""Sorry I took so long. The art is gorgeous and the story is sweet and funny. I agree that the letters need a tweak and I'd like to suggest Blambot. He has some lovely fonts that are free to use."", ""Thank you! To be honest I was sitting on this story for years - even before my first attempt at this comic. At this point I'm not sure if it's good or I just think so because this is my story-baby. So outside perspective is much appreciated.\nThank you for the suggestion, I'll look those fonts up :]"", 'I know that feeling very well.

You don't necessarily have to do this, it's just what I've noticed with my readers. Might give you better luck and more frequent uploads as well.\nI'd be a bit careful using historical figures (ya boy H.P. to be specific) just because people will go in already having an idea of that person based on their own knowledge and perceptions. For example, Lovecraft was extraordinarily racist, even for his time. This might effect your foreshadowing as well depending on how much of his life and works you use. People might see things coming. Just make sure you've done your research, even with this being a fictional piece. Also be careful not to pull too much inspiration from Lovecraft's works. Make sure you make it your own, ya know. \nI didn't know they were on a boat until the end of the chapter. It does mention a river, but I didn't automatically think boat.

So I created this book club! Let’s call it “The Great Book Club” (My mind is blank lmao) I absolutely love book clubs, I must have participated in, like, 5? 6? book clubs. An awesome experience each time, but what really made it great is the people. When there’s an awesome team, then you get great results. This is what this book club is about; connecting with other writers and perhaps even making long term friends! 
So I understand that people have likes and dislikes so you may state which genres you enjoy reading and which you do not in the Form and I will try to pair you with the best possible match!(Please be patient if you are paired with a genre that you don’t like that much or if the book you have been assigned isn’t to your liking: Everyone starts somewhere and the point here is to be supportive so try to be nice, and offer constructive criticism.)
Also, this book club is open to non-writers as well! If you would like to join, don’t hesitate to fill out the Readers’ Form! ️
There are 3 forms:
The Writers’ Form https://forms.gle/Kp1v358foPi7aDJ973The Readers’ Form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFBSr_TmMwVC7xRgS_Ss7_K6qHqV5s0n5GRXwgxI0vhlbp1Q/viewform?usp=sf_linkSub-club Form (will get to that later) https://forms.gle/ico9wyMfm8SidBiv91
You fill the form out and I will include you in the next assignment! (If you would like to enter the Book of the Week contest state it in your form. The BOTW contest is explained later! )
Read the Rules before submitting your form.
Assignments will be posted every Friday because Friday is mostly fun for people, after a long day of work/school you get to relax and maybe do your assignment! ;D Deadline is every Thursday.
**
Rules
**So we will have assignments, BOTW (Book of the Week)  and BOTM (Book of the Month). There's also the Sub-Club which I explain later. Simple.

Assignments: Every week I will assign one book to each of you based on the genres you like. Your task is to read 3 chapters and comment on each of them. Each comment must be at least 4 lines long, but you can write more if you wish! Please do.  Also, please subscribe to the book even if you don't plan on continuing it, as a sign of support to the writer! It will mean a lot to them I'm sure. 
(Note: If I see you commenting random stuff and not actually reading the book, I will give you 1 strike. I explain strikes later.) 
You can ramble about how good it is or offer constructive criticism. If I see any bullying happening, you will be banned. Be nice, people!! 
When you are done with your assignment please message me ""Done."" If you did, I will reply with a thanks. If you didn't, I will message you what you have missed. Then I will expect you to message me ""Done"" again. 
If you enter this club with 2 books, then it's only fair that you will have 2 assignments. If you want to change your books, feel free to message me at any time! 
If you can't do your assignments this week or need an extension, please message me before the assignments are posted.
Every week there is the Book of the Week contest! You can choose whether you want to enter your book or not. If you do, state it in your form and I will add you to the list! Then I will post the list document with all the story summaries and the voting link in the weekly assignment post and the readers will vote for the book that seems the most appealing to them based on the summary you will submit or if they have read it, the one they liked the most. If you win, your book will be assigned to every person in the book club. Yep. Everyone. Awesome, right? 
Everyone will have to read and comment on 3 chapters of your book. If someone is assigned with your book that week, they have to read and comment on 6 chapters. After your book has won Book of the Week once, you may not enter it again, but you can enter another book of yours! (You can join this book club with a maximum of two books.) If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to message me!

There’s also the Book of the Month which is merely a suggestion from me, not obligatory.  This is a book I have read and loved, and of course you can recommend me your or someone else’s novel and if I like it, I will make it book of the month. It will be a book from a member of this book club.
Strikes: If you finish the assignment late, you get a strike. If you get 3 strikes,you are getting banned from the book club. The only way to get rid of a strike is to finish an assignment in less than 24 hours after it's been posted.
Deadline for assignments is every Thursday.
If you have read everything so far, mention your favourite book in the ""Anything else"" section of your form!! If you forget to do it, I will message you to read the rules again.

Hope you join!! 
Now, the Sub-Club!
This is for the people who want their entire book read!/Will read someone's entire book in exchange. You will be paired with this book every week until you are done with it. If you no longer want to keep reading it, send me a message to change your assignment! It's 3 chapters (or more if you want) of the book per week until you are finished with it. If you enter this book club with 2 books, then you will be assigned to 2 books (it's only fair). You can enter this sub-club, and stay in the normal Great Book Club as well but you will have separate assignments. You still have to read BOTW (book of the week)! The sub-club has the same rules as the Great Book Club so read them carefully!
FAQ

When do I start?If you have joined in the middle of a week, you will start the Friday after that. If you join on a Friday, chances are I won't have the time to add you unfortunately. Your best option here is to just check if you have been paired. If you haven't, you will have to wait until next week. (^^)
I only have 1 or 2 chapters, can I still join? Of course! But you will still have to read the 3 chapters of your assignment, plus BOTW.
How does reader only work?Readers only are the awesome people who read without having their stuff read. ️
What if I have been assigned someone’s book again? You read the next 3 chapters. So if you have read chapters 1-2-3, you will now read chapters 3-4-6.
Can I change my book? Yes. Just message me. Message me any questions you have!
When is the deadline for assignments?Every Thursday aka 1 day before new assignments are posted. (Assignments are posted every Friday.)

Hope you join!! If you do, please don't reply in this thread, and just save this post, give it a like and fill out your form because I want it to be easy for the members to find the weekly assignment post or/and any announcements! I will probably be making a separate ""group chat"" per say in the forum for everyone to talk/get to know eac other! If you have any questions, feel free to provate message me!

Anyway I'll get back to you in a few days, I'll talk to you then."", ""I'd be down, I love binging 100+ episode series so I could have it all read by the end of the week and write you a whole review! Are you more of looking for art criticism or story/writing criticism or just overall everything?"", 'Once again thank you big timeWill def support you, looking for more stuff to read anyways', 'That would be amazing, no time pressure here, you could take your time with it too if you want', 'Alright I just finished your whole story so far!! and can I just say your art has improved MAJORLY in however many years you\'ve been working on it. While the art is a bit jarring in the beginning episodes it\'s super cool to see the progression of your style over time. \nNow for the more feedback-ey stuff:This is just a small thing, but you have a lot of little side art pieces scattered throughout the story that are often either paintings of characters or irrelevant works. While these are cool to see, it would help with flow a bit more if you strictly posted these pieces on their own comic instead of intermingled with the main comic unless they\'re cover art or something like that. Another small thing to consider is the transition in storytelling since the very beginning. In the first few pages you used that super interesting choose-your-own-story method to let the reader pick what they were doing. While I agree with a comment that suggested you create separate pages for the different paths, I think this component overall really set your story apart from the common fantasy story. I understand you might not want to mix that into the story anymore but you might consider trying to bring it back or even just doing a short side story with that style of storytelling. \nOnto the big thing: DiolougeYou do a really good job of using dialogue to move the story forward. However, the words themselves often feel kind of chunky to read. There is the matter of grammar, which you have drastically improved in but have a little bit more to go- you might want to work on learning when and where to use a comma. On the subject of grammar, one piece of dialogue is consistently confusing. The number 100% is spoken by the characters constantly. While saying ""100%"" is frequent in anime I suppose when a character loudly exclaims they\'re going to give it their 100% effort, people generally rarely use this phrase. When they do use it, they phrase it as such- they\'re giving something 100% effort, they\'re 100% ready to do something. It\'s rarely used with a negative- you don\'t really say anything along the lines of giving it not 100%. And if you do want to use this number, if it\'s just something that character really likes saying, I would recommend writing out the words ""one hundred percent"" instead of ""100%"" because the reader is expecting consistence with the text they\'re looking at and different symbols can appear quite jarring. And to transition from the text looking jarring, I do want to say that I appreciate the current font you\'re using. The font in the beginning was artsy but uncomfortable to look at and the font right now is much easier to digest. However, make sure you\'re laying out your text in a way that is also comfortable for the readers eyes to follow. You have some bubbles where text is off center, there are multiple lines, or it hangs over. If I had to guess, I would assume you were individually picking the line length of every line you write and then just hitting the enter key and centering a new line under it. This strategy works, but make sure you pick line lengths that are generally similar in length. If you can\'t get them similar in length, try to push the longer lines to the middle. And keep every line in the bubble centered together, kind of like this:______Blah Blah Blah_________Blah Blah Blah Blah__________Blah Blah Blah____And I know I\'ve been referring to the bubble this whole time, but just in case you haven\'t picked up on this trick: you actually shouldn\'t have the bubble drawn until after you\'ve got your text. Simply line out the text based on where your text says the bubble will be, and then draw in the bubble around the text. That way you won\'t have to size your text weirdly.And if you want to include two different statements in one bubble, as in the character is saying two consecutive things, try not to. This again makes the speech look clunky and shoved together. Create a separate bubble for every statement a character makes, even if they\'re in the same panel. You can have one layered under another or connect them in order to show they\'re from the same character.Lastly, be sure to think about how the reader is going to look at your bubbles. Specifically, the order. There are a few times in the story where you want the reader to read the bubble on the right before the bubble on the left, but there is no queue that they need to do so other than the fact that the character is on the right. Even if you have a character on the right, you should put their speech bubble above or farther left of the other characters if they\'re speaking first. Your reader can\'t keep track of which bubble to read first if it\'s based on which side of their screen they need to be looking at. \nAnd to end on a positive note, I really like your use of the Japanese characters as sound effects, they\'re present without being too intrusive and the font is clean and not distracting. I also really like the backgrounds in the gutters of your panels and your use of negative space in nighttime scenes when there is super strong contrast between the dark scenes and the white stars or plants. \nI think that\'s all I\'ve got. Hopefully it makes sense and I wasn\'t too harsh. I really like your story overall so far and I\'ve added it to my library so I\'ll be keeping up to speed with it ', 'Wow, now thats quite  the review, thank you so much for you efforts here, yeah the thing with the bubbles will hopefully now be fixed now that I got a typesetter. Finding the time to redraw the first few chapters is gonna be a pain xD. Definitely will consider your ideas, once again thank you lots and how would you like payment, paypal?', ""Don't worry about the payment, I don't even actually have a paypal or anything set up "", 'I see I see, well thank you big time for your effort, couldn’t appreciate enough xD', ""I'd be interested in doing a paid review, depending on how you want me to review it.

NILMERG | Tapas
A troll’s journey beneath the swamps of his ancestral homeland. On a quest presaged by dark omens, NILMERG sets out to thwart a coalescence of foul magic, and find his missing brother in the dungeon below.





","[""I can see why this would be a hard sell on Tapas. The style is very oldskool, reminds me of old Warhammer art, or pre-third edition D&D etc. It's a style that probably predates the birth of a lot of Tapas users by a good decade or two! The lurid colours are cool, very Mignola-esque.\nI don't know if it'll help you find an audience, but a couple of things that could improve the comic would be:\n\nWatch your lines of action through your pages. They tend to read better if you don't keep switching which direction the character is moving through panels and which side of the panel they're on. The camera is jumping around a lot on the first page in particular, so it feels less like we're following the troll on a journey, and more like we're jumping all around him. It's quite jarring and disorientating.\nAvoid having characters speaking in panels with their mouths closed. There's one panel where the troll is fighting a bunch of monsters and a few of them have their mouths open, but his is closed, but the speech is supposed to be coming from him. It feels a bit odd.\n"", '@darthmongoose Thanks for the feedback and critiques.

episode 1(it has a second half immediately after to conclude it)","['Hello and welcome.\nFirst I must be honest. You need to make your comic mobile friendly. It was hard to read.\nYour art isn’t that well made but what can I tell about that, I can only make blue square stickmen.\nWhat I really think you have here is a great talent for storytelling. You have nice settings and dialog and some great action. You might be flagged by apple in the app for panties and pervert fighting style. But so what. It was fun to read.\nWish you good luck', ""@jensrichard77 Thanks for your feedback broI'm wondering tho how do I make it more mobile friendly, do I have to change the size of my pages to make it work, I'll really like to improve it so more people can enjoy the ride along with me so any tips would be great"", 'One thing could be making it a scrolling comic. But just start with blowing the text up', ""Hmmm I wonder how I'll blow up the text since I make the bubbles as I draw, maybe I'll draw the text bubbles bigger and make the dialogue bigger as well, or I'll just not draw the bubbles as I'm going then do it on the computer, only thing is that it may hide the art and I sorta want any art improvement I make be obvious to the reader.But thanks for the tip, i'll find a way to get the best of both worlds"", 'Then just make it all bigger and use the hight of the format. You are not bound to think in A4 booknpage when you are online', ""I think the anatomy could use some work, the best way to practice it is to either break it down to simpler 3d shapes or study anatomy photos or drawings. \nI believe you're working traditionally with pen'n ink? Try to practice the ideal use of line weight. I can notice that you have some sense of perspective in your art, but currently your art seems a bit flat due to the same line weight used on the characters and the background. The rule of thumb is to usually give the closest object in the panel the thickest lines. It will create the illusion of it being closer to the camera, then give the background thinner lines to make your characters on the front more visible. Made a quick example of how it works:\n\ntut.jpg4000x2600 517 KB\n\nOther than that, keep on practicing, and you'll keep improving, as you keep on drawing "", ""Okay, now some text is just impossible to understand, not only on phone, but on a monitor too. It's too small and untidy and just scribbles.Originally I thought you write the text by hand, it looks like it's scribbled very badly. So maybe try different font. You should first put speech bubbles, not trying to compress text into the whatever space you have later! Because you definitely do this now Also it's quite confusing if I should read left to right or right to left, because the first wall of text on the first page is put on the right part (by the way, wall of exposition text is not really great by itself, people don't really enjoy reading those), but then we should start reading from the left. Most westerners read from left to right, so starting narration on the right makes no sense."", ""I gave it a very brief read cause I'm kinda busy and I'm noticing two things:One, on the same note as @Kelheor, the font you used is messy, small and scribbled, making it difficult to read.Two, the images are rather low quality, likely uploaded at a small size and automatically upscaled in Tapas. It's best if you upscale the images to the maximum size in a separate program in order to maintain quality.\nHope this helps (it probably won't)."", ""OHHH , I'm gonna use it, thanks bro"", ""@Kelheor @Slimy_Boi_Enigma @jensrichard77hey guys I changed the size of pages to 940x1200pls Is the dialogue a lot better now for both pc and mobileI already know what it says since the font was made with my handwriting so I can see what they say no matter what, depending on the feedback I'll also apply the change to the first episodes, I'll probably also change the font style since my font isn't as legible as I thought\n\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nThe Rolling Stone :: ESCAPADE 2- STRANGERS | Tapas\nFor as long as history dates back, humans have ruled as the dominant species on earth, but over time strange phenomena have been recorded, some chalked up to coincidences, hallucinations or lies and others have become legends themselves.

Good call on keeping the power display off-screen because it adds an element of mystery and curiosity.The text is small and speech bubble shape makes the dialogue difficult to read. This is easy to fix with a slightly larger font and making sure that the edges of the bubble don’t overlap with the text as it does in panel 3 of page 1.Again, the opening panel on page 2 is excellent. You get an immediate feel for Chris’ home life and the news report does a great job of summing up the world and his relationship to his father.The exchanges between Anna and Chris are well executed but the text and speech detracts from the dialogue. The speech bubbles on page 3 detract from the aesthetic of the page. Their positioning could be rearranged to better utilize space and the larger dialogue bubbles could be broken up into smaller bubbles for easier reading. Chris’ motivation for becoming a hero is unclear, but it is early in the story and I am more than willing to let that develop and come out as the comic progresses rather than having it info dumped from the get go.On page 5, would the criminal suspect Chris has super powers? If so, being a criminal, would he have experience dealing with powered-people in his previous misdeeds? Or are powers rare enough it is uncommon for street criminals to come across heroes?Chris’ first outing as a hero hits all the right notes and scenes but the showing of his power is a little confusing. I wasn’t quite clear what he was doing and I wouldn’t mind the pace being a tad slower to better showcase his powers and how he uses them even though it is an action scene just to get a better idea of what he is doing. I assume the ‘VOIP’ is him teleporting but wasn’t sure when he first caught the robber. Overall, you have an intriguing story and premise, the character interactions work, and you’ve laid the foundation down for a fun world to visit. The text size is the main hang up, it needs to be bigger for easier readability."", 'read through your comic. the art is very good and the art style is really unique. my only complaint is with the text. there’s quite a few typos, formatting errors and it could use some more punctuation. maybe proofread the dialogue a little more? other than that it has a compelling start\nif you want to take a look at my comic here it is:\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nMirror Monster | Tapas\nAfter Josie manages to trap herself in another dimension with a magical mirror, she has to make sure to keep clear from the sinister criminal Erena and her helpers while traveling around the dimension with the mirror, to find a way to get back to...\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""This actually not that bad this comic has some like the art style reminds me a bit of frank millers artist style hell I could even see a potential of us crossing over (my comic is also a superhero comic) if you like you can read my comic i recommend you read season 2 because that's the one I'm working on Rn \n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nMr.INK :: Season 2 episode 1 cover | Tapas\na superhero comic about an uninteresting guy doing interesting and heroic things.

I think you're lettering is very well done, I'm a big fan of a supernatural aspect within the modern day, a talking dog is always fun of course and I think the shading is often really well done. I found you did a very good job at world building, I found myself pretty interested and wanting more as I was reading and overall I think it was a very good reading experience. Sometimes I found the perspective looked a little bit off but in general it was a good time and I'm interested in checking it out more."", ""So I read through your first 3 chapters, started the fourth and then skipped ahead closer to the end. I really enjoyed your comic, I think it has a sense of humor to it, an interesting premise and some fun characters. My initial issues had to do with the lettering, I wasn't crazy about the font you originally used and the text was not centered often. But after skipping ahead I found that all those issues were resolved  which is great because it leaves me without much negative to say based on what I've seen"", ""At your recommendation, I read through what you have for the second season of your comic, after doing so I kind of just skimmed over your first part. It's an interesting premise, the second season almost reminds me of a plot I would see in an anime with how over the top it is with these three girls controlling the school (which isn't a bad thing because I like over the top) and I think you're characters you have are quite interesting. I do however think there are some points that could use improvement, I don't think it would hurt to work on the lettering a bit, the font is very thin and the text bubbles could use some improving. I find a lot of the time as well your backgrounds are empty and flat and could maybe use a bit more colour as well as some extra detail. Now like I said I did skim through the first part and I've noticed a huge improvement between the first and second parts which is great and if you continue to improve I'm sure you'll only get better.  I think that improving the lettering could make a world of difference and really help to make it more visually appealing to the reader. For sure though I hope you keep at it and keep practicing."", 'So I read through Arrival and I really enjoyed it.

A review of mine would be nice but you don't have to if the comic doesn't catch your attention.\nThe first pages look like the art and the comic-making were done by two different people. What I mean by that is the art looks professional, but the red/blue background and the thick black lines and the wonky typesetting and speech bubbles look amateur. The bright white text bubbles also stand out a lot on the desaturated, dark art, making them look even more incongruent with the art. Starting page 3 things begin to look a lot better but the typesetting is still weird at times. Try to keep an equal amount of white space on all sides around the text. Also, consider making impactful/ emotional speech bigger/bolder, and putting it in spiky or tilted bubbles. The text is also kind of small.

394,Review my comic? JETX,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, I am a little nervous about asking this. General bad thoughts and I guess I want to punish myself due to lack of confidence in myself as a creator. But mostly because I don't get as much feedback as I thought I would (Comments are fairly scarce) and being new to this whole online scene I guess thats normal?
I guess what I am trying to say is I just want to know what people think of my comic so far. I DID want to save something like this for when the first chapter was finished but as I said, I guess I feel like punishing myself because my brain is being weird with negative thoughts..
Anyways, Heres the comic:

Not that its much of an excuse but I have about 5 months worth of backlog/buffer ontop of what is already posted.And please feel free to tell me if I am being stupid or an idiot for thinking this way or anything. Again, Its probably just me.
PS: Sorry for talking and saying so much.
PPS: Sorry for the PS message >3<' I am just rambling now I guess, I am sorry.","['I can see why you feel confused and concerned. I was actually pretty surprised when I saw the level of polish of the comic and the small subscriber number that doesn\'t quite seem to match the level of effort and polish.\nQuick impressions:\n\nThe comic is quite decompressed, so not a lot happens per-page in the first couple of pages especially, which is fine, but since pages are posted individually, it feels very slow to get into.\nEvery single page has a large call to action banner underneath, and since the pages are short, it feels like I\'m constantly being interrupted in my reading with an advert. Especially since the pages aren\'t made up with a decent gap between the panels and the ad.\nAs soon as the two pages of a bunch of unrelated seeming stuff are out the way, we\'re hit with LOADS of text. It\'s centre-aligned in the square boxes (you want that to be left-aligned) and doesn\'t have enough breathing space between the box edges and the text. The balloons also have the same padding issue, it makes it feel even more like it\'s this cramming in of loads of text. \nThis is less a criticism and more an observation... the art style is probably a hard-sell on Tapas. It sort of makes me think like... ""Megaman meets Garfield"" with this style that feels like a cross between very slick, brightly coloured, spiky manga and knobbly old newspaper gag strips. It\'s not badly drawn, and it\'s very polished, it\'s just an odd style and I\'m not 100% sure who the target audience for it would be. It reads like it\'s for children with the bright colours and simple plot that feels like an old video game or the Sonic the Comic I would read as a kid, but then characters say ""Shit!"" like it\'s nothing.\n\nThere\'s nothing inherently wrong with making something very personal for your own enjoyment, but I think there\'s a high chance that the target audience for this will be hard to find on Tapas, and that\'s likely the biggest obstacle for it on this platform. I\'d actually expect more success somewhere like Facebook, with an audience of thirty-somethings who don\'t normally read comics, but would like something like comics they read as kids, but made for them.', 'Well i\'m subbed to your comic but i wouldn\'t mind giving a review as well. \n\nSo right off the bat (after the chapter cover) we have a couple of action pages of what seems like a prologue (65 million years ago does feel kinda prologue-esque). \nWhat i like about these pages is that it is purely show-don\'t tell. It\'s waaay different from all the dull fantasy prologues that go like ""the holy war between angels and demons"" or ""hi i\'m a hybrid cat angel girl whose parents were killed and now i attend a magic high school with my crush"".\nI do agree with some of the points @darthmongoose made though. I won\'t go in detail as these points have already been made but i do want to point out some of the important ones.\nOn page 3 there are a couple of panels with text. One of the things working against you is the bigger bubble with text on the right. It draws my attention and leaves the lesser crammed panels unattended. I\'m not saying that you should remove that text bubble but maybe figure out how the readers eyes\' should flow through the page.\nAlso i feel the pages 18 & 19 are a little bit crammed with text. Not too big of a problem but like i said before, the sheer quantity of text bubbles take away my attention from the visuals on the page. \n\nTo sum my advice up, i\'d say: try to find a balance between text and visuals. A picture says more than a few sentences. For example, instead of saying there are five more crystals, you could do this:\n\n1581934240751.png1000x1000 37.8 KB\n\nApologies i suck at drawing earth and also i drew this on my phone but you get the idea, it\'s show don\'t tell. That would be my advice to you.', ""Thats okay, And thank you for being a subscriber it means a whole lot me!And drawing something regardless even if its on your phone is still pretty cool!\nSo don't have as much plot dumps I suppose they're called and more just try and show things happening? Than being silver-aged comic strips? I didn't know they were a problem. Ill try to cut down to please folks >3<'\nIm sorry you don't like pages 18 and 19. Is it just the amount of text? How much text should there be? Did I reveal too much already of things? Is it too much? Im sorry if its too much. As I said above this paragraph Ill cut down and try to improve better >3<'\nThank you for saying things though I appretiate it alot!\nIm sorry again for saying alot. Im not normally good with talking much about this kind of thing. It makes me very nervous and trying to improve. >3<'"", 'Do you also think the upload speed per page is too slow for what it is?? Im sorry for spamming with a message. Just wanna make sure that things are good. >3<', ""Thank you for the reply. And thanks for complimenting about the effort and level of polish, I guess thats a good thing? Im not too sure how to interpret that one. ^^'\nDecompressed as in that Id need to upload more pages a week perhaps? Im only doing them weekly because of things happening irratically but I can change it to twice weekly if that is what would benefit it. I haven't done anything with showing off artworks and stuff besides just drawing them so I havent ever done this before. >3<\nI actually use swearing sometimes with setting tones, or more so than not. As apart of my own vocabulary. (Probably a bad idea). I mostly don't know what my target demographic actually is considering most people just ignore what I do and I don't have much confidence. I mostly draw and write the story as something I want to see and to help me cope with my social anxiety disorder and my own insecurities.\nIf the banners and stuff is too much I can take them off or something! I don't want that to deter anyone from enjoying reading comics or anything. Like if it annoys folks Ill take them right off if thats the case. Just I didnt know if it bothered anyone because I don't know how to communicate with subscribers or readers because I suppose its really small what I've got now. >3<\nAs for the art style, Thank you for the critique with it or I guess observation lol. You and someone else a long while ago on the forums said Garfield so I guess its a Garfield style? lol. I mostly like drawing cartoons and making things cartoony mostly because I don't really like real anime styles when it comes to drawing. Is the bright colors bad for people? I admit I am really bad when it comes to colors. I use too many reds I admit. >3<'\nAnd I am sorry for the amounts of reading text as well, I just don't know how to start anything off really well, or at all. So I am sorry there is alot of text. I do want to improve when it comes to story telling and getting opinions and thank you for the review.\nBut I do have my own doubts with my abilities, I mean. As you said, it'll be hard to find an audience that'll enjoy what I draw if I dont really have anything like that in mind. Or I just accept it isnt good I suppose. ^^'\nThank you for the review that I asked for. Heheheh .. ^^;\nPS: Again! Im very sorry I wrote so much and don't mean to sound mean. >3<'"", ""Don't worry about the text too much, text is good! My advice is just to prevent your characters from being squashed by the text bubbles And hey, you already did amuch better job regarding text bubbles than this page from HxH:\n\n20200216_084332.jpg1152x1821 947 KB\n\nAs for the upload speed i'm kinda in the same boat as you especially since i started colouring digitally."", ""That makes me feel a bit better, I was stressing out for nothing I suppose lol.\nI guess I just still gotta be better at art then if the style deterrs people.. ^^'"", '\n\nZak:\nPS: Again! Im very sorry I wrote so much and don\'t mean to sound mean. >3<\'\nI wouldn\'t say you sound mean at all. You see almost overly apologetic for your work more than anything. \nI think in terms of decompressed storytelling, you might find that the pacing of your comic would be suited best not to more updates, but actually to fewer or less frequent updates made up of multiple pages stacked (long scroll format). I\'m actually in the middle of trying switching from two single page updates a week to a single update a week made of two stacked pages myself, because people read webcomics differently nowadays from when I used to draw them and seem keen to get larger chunks of content.\nI think the thing to think about is ""What do I want to get out of drawing this comic?"" and I would say to keep in mind that a large factor in your comic\'s low readership has nothing to do with the actual quality, it\'s just a very different sort of comic from the kind of thing people on Tapas generally are into in terms of both style and content. If just making a comic for you and a few friends to enjoy is enough to make you happy then, wow, that\'s awesome, you just do you! But if you really feel the need to build a bigger audience to help your self confidence, there are two questions to ask:1. Where might I find the kind of people who would like this so I can promote it? (my bets are Facebook and Reddit for this one)OR:2. If I wanted to build a bigger audience on Tapas, what changes could I make to appeal more to the audience that\'s here? (You\'d probably want to tweak things like the style and format, I\'m not sure if this is best because I think you\'re making something really personal in a style you love working in, so I\'d only suggest this if you really care a lot about bookmark numbers).', 'Well, I DO want more readers as much as the next person. Or it could be more audience interaction? Im not sure. Its a passion project for sure and I do it as a way of coping with my confidence and anxiety. I do want to get it printed one day so I could try to go for a more a long scroll format, but Id probably just combine two pages into one update maybe. Im unsure.\nI guess deep down I asked for the review so I can see bad comments so I can beat myself up mentally for whenever I feel down on myself. Which is most of the time. Ill take what you said to heart and try to improve.']",2/17/2020 3:41,https://forums.tapas.io/t/review-my-comic-jetx/41230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just letting you know that I'm running a inksgiving race where the supporter can support one of my characters to win the Grand Prix.The names are:Blue, Miss Blue, Yellow, Red, PurpleWho will you give your support to?"", ""Ooh this is an interesting looking comic.\nOverall, it's pretty polished in terms of the quality of the art and how it's put together, with a consistent art style, good inking and colours, but there are some things that jumped out at me:\nThe speech bubbles at times don't quite leave enough breathing room for the text inside them, and the thick white stroke on them set to outside positioning gives the tails this rounded, snubbed kind of look. They'd look a little more polished and finished if you made them a little larger to give the text breathing room, avoided tangents caused by the square bubbles sitting on panel borders and set the stroke's position to centre or inside.\nLack of a proper establishing shot makes it really hard to drink in the atmosphere or the situation the protagonist is in. The camera is always pulled right in on him, not really showing much of his situation, and because the shots are always pulled in so tight, when there are close-ups, they're robbed of impact, because they're barely any closer than the majority of the shots. I can't really get invested in the mystery of what's going on because I don't feel like I'm getting a really strong impression of where the protagonist is (it looks like a school, but it's full of dead adults and the main character also looks like an adult, but he doesn't seem confused by this?).\nSometimes the expressions of the main character don't really seem extreme enough for the awful situation he's in. He looks mostly a bit bewildered and surprised while waking up under a pile of corpses, getting told he's to blame by a dude in an extremely gory state, then seeing him die, and then witnessing somebody getting eaten by a dog. I don't feel as horrified as I probably should because the protagonist's expression and bodylanguage are more like he's in a weird scenario rather than an utterly horrifying one that'd probably cause most people to throw up or have a panic attack.\nI felt like the colours were very bright and warm and generally sunny feeling for the tone of the bloody scene that was going down, and it robbed the scene of some impact. I understand that the scene is happening during the day, but some harsh contrast in the light and shadows, and less warm, soft colours would add a bit of weight and power to the story.The blood feels very watery and thin because it's so pale and transparent, so it doesn't really evoke the horror of being covered in human blood because it looks fake, like watery red paint. The overuse of premade splatter brushes makes it hard to miss that they've been used. Maybe use them more in conjunction with other techniques, and try to get a bit more richness and depth to the blood.\nOverall, it definitely has potential, it just feels a bit like it's trying to do horror while pulling punches on being horrifying. A little more atmosphere and intensity would really help sell the scenario and tone."", 'it would have to go to blue ', 'thank you for the kind words, and checking out my comic, once ive had some sleep i will come back with feedback for you, so far from what i saw the art looks great so looking forward to reading it.', 'Thank you very much for such a detailed review, I defiently agree with the speach bubbes and will give it a try, i was trying to make them unique and make sure that they could be read on mobile easily. But with your suitations i think i can make it work. \nI actuelly already have up to Chapter 20 Drawn out, and there are a lot more establishing shots one everytime the scene changes or room changes , the 1st episode is kind of puporsely done this way, so you dont have a clue whats going on and later will find out. \nWith the experssion and everything and how he is not too shocked by the situation is also explained on in later episodes, the series will go between past and future events and the main charecter starts to become more emtinal due to a friend in the series. \nThe colors i also agree, orginally it was ment to be a horror story with intense scenes and builds up, but this later changed to more of an action story. Honestly this changed due to when this was being published by another website they wanted everything PG. \nAgain thank you so much, the feedback is great, and i will take on boared defiently with the establishing shots and speech bubles.', 'I left a short review in the comments for you, but I think the most important review comment is that I subscribed.

The art is good and consistent. It's a really interesting hook to start a comic with. My only thing is that there is a fine line between comedy and horror, and so it would help a great deal to swing more horror if the color scheme wasn't so friendly? Unless you want it to be on that fine line as a dark humor. Personally, I enjoy that type of humor, but if that wasn't what you were going for, the timing might desire more establishing shots to build up to the horror reveals to make them more scary.\nAnd you don't have to drop me any ink, ps, mines not unlocked yet "", 'It’s funny you should say that, since I was just studying the paneling in yours!

407,Tablet suggestion (Guide),Reviews | Feedback,[],"As we all know Black Friday is soon and even before that day there are already specials and as many artist here or new to the world of tablets will try to get a new tablet for drawing. 
Now we all want that nice one with screen which would be either a cintiq (most likely out of our price range  ) and Ipad or even a Microsoft surface. But this might still be out of price range, specially if you are just starting out. This is why I am making this tread for alternative and of course views on all this tablets (traditional ones and tablet ones as well as 'starting out' ideas). Let's start:
Traditional Drawing Tablets


amazon.com



Amazon.com: Huion Inspiroy H640P Graphics Drawing Tablet with Battery-Free Stylus and 8192 Pressure Sensitivity: Computers & Accessories


$39.99






Price: 39.99Discount probability: Right now it has a discount of 10% discount, so you might see a higher percent discount closer to black friday or even a lighting deal of sort.
This baby is a GOOD starting place, not only do you get amazing pressure sensitivity you get amazing support in term of been able to connect to a Mac, Windows or even Android device! Is also a good starting point in term of size. I suggest if you starting out to not go with a big size one, it will be even more overwhelming. A simply small size is good, price is also really good. You could find cheaper ones (even from Huion), but this one I recommend highly cause of not having to be tether to computer and been able to use your cellphone or even tablet! Sadly no IOS support.


amazon.com



Amazon.com: Wacom Intuos Graphics Drawing Tablet with 3 Bonus Software included, 7.9""x 6.3"", Black (CTL4100): Computers & Accessories







Price: 79.90Discount Probability: This is in the Best Buy black friday shopper actually and will be at 50.00 including the software. Just Clip Studio paint is value at 50, making this a great value.
This is the begginers tablet from Wacom, it is lacking compare to the Huion one in pressure sensitivity (it only has half of Huion (4096) but is still an amazing tablet. Based on my own experience with Wacom, this can easily last you 10 years or even more of heavy use!
Screen Drawing Tablet


amazon.com2



Amazon.com: Huion KAMVAS Pro 12 Drawing Tablet with Screen Graphics Drawing Monitor Full-Laminated Pen Display with Battery-Free Pen and Adjustable Stand 8192 Pen Pressure(GT-116): Computers & Accessories







Price: 229.00Discount Probability: Highly unlikely. This kind of drawing tablets are rarely discounted.
If you want a screen, you can find 'affordable' screen tablets. Another one from Huion with amazing 8192 Pen pressure, sadly this one is only compatible with Windows 7 (and up) and Mac. No Android function this time. Is still at a good price range for this kind of tablets and size is 12 inches, but if you REALLY want a big screen, you can also try:


amazon.com2



Amazon.com: Huion GT-191 KAMVAS Drawing Tablet with HD Screen Graphic Drawing Monitor Pen Display 8192 Pressure Sensitivity with Adjustable Stand - 19.5 Inch: Computers & Accessories


$299.00






Price: 299.99Discount Probability: Highly unlikely. This kind of drawing tablets are rarely discounted.
Price is of course steeper, but not by much. Now if you want the Top of the line  (but still in a budget) you know the next entry is:


amazon.com



Amazon.com: Wacom Cintiq 16 Drawing Tablet with Screen (DTK1660K0A): Computers & Accessories







Price: 549.95Discount: HIGHLY unlikely. 
We all know Wacom IS the name everyone knows when you mention a drawing tablet, even to non-artist people. This also come with Clip studio (a 50 dollar value). 
Stand alone drawing tablet
This kind of tablet are not that common outside of the Ipad and Surface, which might still be expensive for some, so I am going to give a recommendation for people starting out with a budget.


amazon.com



Amazon.com: All-New Fire HD 10 Tablet (10.1"" 1080p full HD display, 32 GB) – Black: Kindle Store


$149.99






Price: 149.99Discount probability: It'll find a way to advertise is in discount even in your dreams! This thing is always going in sale (Even as low as 89.99) during black friday, cyber monday and probably even in your birthday!
I know what you are already thinking 'This has no stylus support, what are you saying?!?' but I will recommend a disc based pen:


amazon.com

$14.99






This of course lacks what we all seek in a drawing tablet: Pressure sensitivity. BUT for starting out and get a feel of drawing you can get this (or any Android tablet for that matter) to start out. For example, I made this drawing using this as an example (is not perfect, but is not that bad I believe).

Is the cheapest form to keep a screen and draw that their is out there. If you really tight on budget, but want to somehow get a tablet for drawing as starting point, this might be your best way. There are going to be a LOT of tablets in special, but do try to get a good one (avoid the RCA or walmart exclusive ones).

Amazon.com : New Apple iPad (10.2-Inch, Wi-Fi, 32GB) - Gold (Latest Model)


$299.00






Price: 299.00Discount probability: It will be at 250 in most places during black friday.
There isn't much to say here, the new Ipad products are excellent for drawing and with the newer Ipad having Apple Pencil support is one of the best form to get a good 'price' with high quality. Price is in quotes cause of course you have to factor in the 99 dollar the apple pencil cost. There are alternative, but most good alternative range in the 70 to 80 price range, so might as well go with the Apple Pencil itself.

Amazon.com : New Microsoft Surface Go (Intel Pentium Gold, 4GB RAM, 128GB) : Computers & Accessories







Price: 399.99Discount: The Microsoft store might have it at 250 or 299 during black friday.
The last alternative is the Microsoft Surface Go with also a great drawing experience, the price is a bit higher than the Ipad, but you do get windows allowing for more options when it comes to drawing applications. The pen is also another 99 price tag, so is still an expensive choice, but if you are able to, highly recommended.

I completely forgot to add this tablet!! This has everything included from the get go, stylus, screen protector and case! From the many reviews I seen is a really good beginners tablet and one of the cheapest!!
Conclusion
I hope this helps you all determine which would be a good table to get based on your budgets and needs! If you have question or some of your own suggestion let me know!","['While my tablet is still functional, this is still pretty helpful! Might graduate to screen tablets in a few years, so thanks.', 'Same here, I have a HuionPro which still works amazing, but I do plan to get an Ipad to be able to draw anywhere instead of just at my computer.', 'I very much recommend Huion tablets. They’re really great quality and way cheaper than Wacom. \nThis is the one I use: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07G81XV64?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title4\nIt’s got a massive surface area—larger than a sheet of printer paper. \nI had a much smaller Huion before this hand still use it when I go out. I can’t recommend them enough', 'I’ve got the iPad Pro and I like it a lot. It is really nice that I can bring it with me anywhere. \nBut I’ve been eyeing wacoms for a while too.', ""Ipad Pro is the best choice for Ipad. I just use the more budget conscious tablets and reason I mention the regular ipad.\nWacom is the pinnacle and if you can get one I can't say no to getting it. There is a reason they are the top brand, but if you looking to save some money I highly suggest checking the Huion brand that has high quality at much more affordable pricing."", ""Very informative guide  I got my wacom intuos bundle from Amazon, too. Don't let the reviews fool you, the packaged art software is very easy to download. You get two years worth of Clip Studio Paint, free."", 'Reviews in amazon can be to hit and miss. The intous is the succesor to the bamboo and my bamboo lasted me for 10 years!! They make great tablet, even the beginners one are good.\nClip studio is what I use and it is indeed a great software, the inclusion of 3d elements make it great for people moving from traditional to digital.', ""One day I will not be destitute and I'll get a screen tablet </3\n(Currently am drawing with a tablet that's pen is broken in half and the cord is broken hell yis)"", ""I ended up going with the Cintiq 13HD. I preferred the smaller size so I can easily have it on my lap since I don't have a desk. I compared reviews between the Cintiq and Huion. Some people were saying the Huion's cord was much bulkier and the tablet was heavier which put me off to it since I knew I would be lap drawing. The Cintiq cord is still kind of a beast though since it has the outlet plug, HDMI, USB, and the actual tablet attachment.\nSome people were saying the attachment isn't so good though and it is a bit flimsy. Sometimes it does get knocked out a bit during drawing and needs to be readjusted."", 'Surface pro and CSP are the weapons I take to war with me.', 'That’s good to know because a friend was asking for suggestions that are fairly priced and not apple and I blindly suggested the surface.', 'This is probably well knownBut if you use a macbook, do not buy an hdmi powered tablet with the intention of buying an hdmi - USB converter. I bought a Cintiq and never managed to get the screen to work. \nThe product is pretty decent though... stupid buyer error.', 'Nice guide Dak  \nI can hop in and talk a little bit about the Huion GT-191 Kamvas list above, as that\'s the exact model I upgraded to last December. Overall it\'s been a massive upgrade over the little Wacom Bamboo that I had been using since 2012 (a non-screen tablet with... I think only around 1,000 levels of pressure lol). That one certainly got the job done but moving up into a screen and 8x more pressure has been fantastic. The quality of the tablet itself is really nice, it\'s durable feeling and has a robust adjustable stand. It\'s also large enough to comfortably use as a 2nd monitor even when not drawing xD\nThe downsides that I\'ve noticed after a year of using it: as some reviews I looked at prior to purchasing it said, the lack of hotkey buttons is a little bit of a downer (granted I rarely used the 4 my bamboo had either... but I think now that was mostly because I was a digital art newbie xD). \nAlso I\'ve heard this about Huion tablets before, but it seems to experience somewhat frequent disconnection issues, at least on my computer. If I walk away for too long without powering it off first it either becomes unresponsive or changes my cursor into this weird little dot that still works but is strange. Sometimes this can be fixed by heading into the tablet software where it\'ll say ""Device Disconnected"" and running Administrator Privileges to kickstart it again, other times I simply need to restart my computer after which it\'s fine again. \nLastly idk if it\'s just my incompetence in the matter or the screen itself, but I haven\'t been able to properly color match it to my main screen after 11 months of trying lol.\nAll things considered I\'ve been very happy with it this last year though, especially for the price. It didn\'t break the bank too too hard and was a massive upgrade over my previous tablet ', ""@Mari Amazing you can output your art (which is amazing) i with such limitation! Hope you are able to upgrade soon!! \n@cavechan If you can afford the cintiq that is the way to go indeed!! The bulky cable do suck, but is a evil necessity in those kind of tablets!\n@skicoak I was almost going with surface, but a long came an ipad air deal that I couldn't refuse (289 whne is usally 499).\n @Maps Surface is a great choice if not interested on apple. Similar Android tablet (with stylus support) are just way to expensive. Only one I can recommend that I feel a bit stupid I didn't list it is the Piccasso Tab. Is an android with stylus (already included) and 1024 pressure sensitivity price at 219.\n @LCT-COMICS Thanks for this tip! Suck that problem happen though \n @Rhonder Thanks for your own review!! I do have the problem of disconnect with my own HuioPro, but is mostly cause of the cable, since is not integrated it can become unplug from the tablet, specially if you use the hot keys and touch it from time to time cause of the location of it.\n As for color matching, is hard, heck even same model monitors can't 100% color match. This means two completly different models will even have a harder time, more so uf one has higher brightness output than the other."", 'I bought my iPad last year at Black Friday for $250 from the local Target...I had to pick up an Apple pencil later(I had bought an Adonit stylus at the same time, but they dont work with Clip Studio; does work with Procreate). Still trying to get used working on it; I\'m doing okay, but I just need to work with it more, as well as download a few more brushes.\nI\'ve had my Intuos tablet since 2015...the stylus is wearing down, but I\'m going to stick with it a little longer coz I want to get all my debts paid up first. Next tablet I want to get is the 16"" Cintiq for $750...I use CSP on the laptop as well; the plan is to [eventually] use my laptop & iPad to pencil/ink pages, then use the laptop to color/letter.\nThe main reason for getting my iPad was to eventually eliminate carrying my laptop to the day job, but I still have to- especially since I\'ve fallen behind on my comic making schedule. Once I do catch up(or finish out my current chapter) my plan will be to use my iPad to scribble out standalone art pieces & bolster up my Patreon page.\nOh yeah- if anyone wants a stylus, I have an Adonit Pixel stylus that I\'m willing to part with(for a price); it cost me $60 bucks...I\'m willing to let it go for a reasonably lower price.', 'Cintiq is mostly the dream of all us using tablet xP Though many artist are also using the Ipad Pro for convenience factors of course. IF Wacom ever release a stand alone tablet...that be the dream xP', ""I've used Wacom Bamboo (then Intuos) for years now, and they've always been extremely durable for me. The Intuos I'm currently using has touch capabilities, which I actually kind of love? It's not necessarily a drawing feature, but it's made the rest of my workflow a little more convenient.\nI recently picked up the Huion H430P for travel. It's tiny, and the texture isn't entirely to my liking (too slippery), but the lines I ink come out a lot smoother than my Wacom. Also, some of the Huions come with battery-powered pens, which I imagine would forget constantly."", 'Would probably be ill advised for Wacom to release a stand alone- especially now that not only have Surface & iPad cornered that market, but their affordable pricing would put Wacom to shame.', 'I\'d like to add that if you want a drawing monitor for your computer (Mac/PC), I think the best deal is probably the XP-Pen Artist 22E Pro. It\'s more expensive than the listed tablets at about $400, but there are occasional sales and I think it\'s worth it if you want 21.5"" of drawing space. I haven\'t experienced any bugs with Affinity Designer, Krita, or Inkspace so I can wholly recommend it.\nHere\'s a tip: On Amazon there are two listings for the Artist 22. Both are $400 (Amazon has a 10% off coupon to make it $360 on the listing).  One is the 22 Pro and the other is the 22**E** Pro. They are almost identical, but the E variant has 16 extra programmable buttons, so it\'s a better buy.\n\n\namazon.com2\n\n\n\nAmazon.com: XP-PEN Artist22E Pro Drawing Pen Display Graphic Monitor IPS Monitor 8192 Level Pen Pressure Drawing Pen Tablet Dual Monitor with 16 Express Keys and Adjustable Stand 21.5 Inch: Computers & Accessories\n\n\n$399.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n']",11/8/2019 12:13,https://forums.tapas.io/t/tablet-suggestion-guide/38637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beside being known for industry work. It's kinda sad that in a way looks like Wacom is a Monopoly company. What do you all think of wacom? -pros/consWhat about the other brands too? Like Huion or Ugee? -pros/cons,"[""While I agree that Wacom costs way too much. I've been extremely happy with both my Wacom Bamboo and Wacom Cintiq HD 13. I almost bought a 22 inch Huion, but lots of people who are into line art gave it horrible reviews. Jonathan Rector (Jesop King) went into great detail on his youtube channel. The screen / pen just isn't accurate enough for good line art.\nThe Bamboo is entry level, cheap, and worked fine. I prefer my cintiq obviously, but there was never anything wrong with my bamboo. It tracked perfectly. It did not hold me back in any way."", ""i personally had an awful experience with huion. i had an old bamboo fun tablet, and decided to save up for a display tablet. i was originally going for the cintiq 13hd, but bought the huion gt 220 instead. \nthe tablet worked great the first day, aside from having to go out and buy an hdmi adapter there were no issues. immediately the next day the thing started making loud popping and crackling noises while heating up and for 2 hours after shutting off. every day after, it never stopped. after about 4 nights of having to move it to a different room while i slept because the noise would keep me up at night, i tried for a replacement. oops! since you bought it through amazon we wont send you a replacement and neither will they (even though it had a replacement policy set?). they expected me to return and rebuy it, with about $20-30 sucked out of the refund money. like money i earned through commissions. right after i got the refund i just dished it out for the cintiq 22hd and havent had a single problem since.\nluckily i'd also had about $1k in allowance money saved up over like 7 years? my parents never actually gave me the money they just kept piling it up in a bank account so i was able to use that for the cintiq in addition to what i'd saved on my own.\nedit: i did forget to mention that it was really badly packaged. they put it in a box way bigger than it with no padding so the defects might've been from it being tossed around in the box? thats what i thought caused most of the issues (though i've heard other stories of huion products being poorly made/breaking easier)"", ""I'm not really a fan of Wacom.

I think it's mainly because you can see where your hand is going so you don't have to hit ctrl-z as many times to get the lines juuust right. I normally only finished like 1 full-color thing in the past and it took me about an hour to do just a sketch of two characters with my intuos pro but with the cintiq I can hammer out a sketch in 20 minutes or less.\nOnly problem with the 13hd is that it's cable is extremely finicky. If you don't plan on moving it too much then that shouldn't be a problem, but replacement cables are hell to come by since they're practically sold out everywhere except for One Site (that isn't even wacom's).

GENRE: chinese-fantasy, a slice of life, BLCharacters: a flower fairy and a dragon (in human form) [I know, so original]
Ep 1 is just of them meeting in the forest.
The flower fairy is off to give his blessings to some trees so they flourish, he bumps into a dragon in man form. He thought it's odd to see dragons at this time of the year, as they have all migrated to warmer regions until mid-spring. So the fairy made some small talk and parted ways. The dragon, being alone and all...thought since he's got nowhere to be, might as well hang around the fairy for a bit. The dragon then catches up to the fairy to follow him around.

The Primordial B Plus | Tapas
An above average school paper leads to an unlikely chain of events, and to startling discoveries!





Hi, I just spent several months revising and improving this comic book, and would like to get opinions on the results.

414,Back from hiatus to review more webcomics,Reviews | Feedback,[],"it's been a long time since I've written a review but after doing a lot of preparation I'm ready to come back to webcomic journalism with a shiny new website https://webcomicnetwork.com41.I exclusively cover webcomics, unlike most comic journalists who will only occasionally entertain a webcomic to fill gaps between mainstream print comics. I don't just write reviews because my process is very in-depth and can take a long time for longer webcomics so I try and write other things that are useful and entertaining to both webcomic fans and creators.but reviews are what my old blog was known for.so I'm ready to do more reviews and it's my policy to never refuse a webcomic that asks for a review, this does mean the waitlist gets long sometimes, but I always treat each review with the same amount of respect so I never rush.
also, I have a unique scoring method for webcomics and I'd be interested in your thoughts on it https://webcomicnetwork.com/Articles/three_factor_rating_system15it breaks up the core elements of a piece of work into 3 separate scores, that way a style over substance webcomic won't be affected by the same judging criteria for substance over style, hopefully, this will make ratings less ambiguous.","['Would be lovely if you reviewed my webcomic called The Frolic:\n\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nThe Frolic | Tapas\nFirst storyarc of The Frolic called ""Home"" is a tale of a somewhat eponymous detective Frolik, who tries to stop a serial killer fixated on killing young parents.

415,Another Comic Review/Praise Thread | Story-Based Comedy,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hiya!
I want to read more comics and motivate fellow creators, so here's another review/praise thread~
What I'm looking for is story-based comedy. Anything from fairly simple slice of life stories to complex fantasy settings is A-OK, as is any amount of comedy as long as it's present at all. (""That one sassy character"" counts.)
If your comic fits the bill and you'd like a review, please respond with a link and I'll get to it whenever I can. 
Some notes -1. I'll only review one of your works, and only comics.2. By default, I'll only point out things I liked because we all work hard and praise is awesome.3. If you'd like a more balanced, ""proper"" review and/or advice, please tell me. (FWIW, I have experience regarding monetization, features, working with Japanese indie creator-based companies, and anime style works are my ""specialty."")
tl;dr I want to get attached to your characters and laugh with/at them. grabby hands","[""Well there is my comic Life in Staffinburg which is between comedy and drama. I wouldn't mind having a proper review done on it please.  \n https://m.tapas.io/series/Life-In-Staffinburg2"", ""Someone once said they considered my comic a comedy so I guess Ill throw it in as such.\nI honestly wouldn't mind getting some feedback or opinions on it.\n\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nIvolice and the Emissaries  | Tapas\n[Updates Fridays]\nA new semester of school begins for young Ivolice Bartlett.

Feedback is always helpful. ^_^ My comic is primarily fantasy/action, but Raul (who comes in at the beginning of chapter 2) is a fairly comedic character and I think there's a decent amount of comedy in some of the character interactions.\nI guess I'd ask for a middle ground in terms of nature of review haha? In the longterm I'm definitely interested in knowledge about monetization and features although it's not an immediate concern, so I wouldn't mind hearing some critique towards those ends. But I'm also a bit stressed right now so I don't wanna get overwhelmed with stuff I can't easily improve on.\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nThe Broken Ones | Tapas\nThree dysfunctional adventurers - a shady psion, a rebellious pirate, and a distrustful con artist - are forced to work together when the new king tasks them to reclaim the castle town of Oganthir after a long and bloody civil war.

Great characters with entertaining interactions and lovely diverse designs, even (if not especially) among side characters. Incidentally, Raul is my favorite not only because he brings in a lot of the type of comedy I like, but also because I\'m strongly biased towards chaotic high charisma characters lol. I really appreciate how easy the characters are to understand from the moment they first show up, while also hinting at more depth to come as the story progresses. The way the dysfunctional trio ends up meeting (and having to work together) is really fun and backed up by their strong dynamic - shoutout to boss lady Bree who will hopefully be able to keep Raul\'s sass in check and get Rowan to talk here and there lol. She has my favorite design out of the bunch, can\'t resist a cool pirate girl.\nTo me characters are the deciding factor in whether I\'m invested in a story or not, and The Broken Ones does them really well. I\'m sold whenever I get this feeling of ""I\'d follow these dorks on any journey they\'re on"" - which I did pretty much as soon as the main trio met. The character writing and overall character design is easily the comic\'s strongest point imo.\nI space out easily when it comes to story details (that\'s entirely on my brain, not your writing!) so I don\'t feel confident in commenting on my overall impression of the plot itself, but what I can say is that I definitely enjoy the pace of the story progression. The way I see it, there\'s a perfect balance of keeping the reader engaged and giving us enough time to breathe inbetween the action to understand how their world works. There\'s a lot that\'s conveyed purely visually (I\'m loving those magic/action effects!) without the need for huge lore dumps, which is a big plus.\nOne more thing you\'re really good at is giving each update a fantastic ending in the form of a cliffhanger that makes it hard to stop reading or a light-hearted moment that reminds you of the strong character interaction. It seems to me that you\'ve already got an excellent grasp on what\'s important in a comic and what makes each update worth looking forward to - you never seem to shy away from difficult poses or backgrounds, I\'m not seeing any ""filler"" panels, legibility is good on desktop and mobile, updates are consistent without any big breaks. Kudos to both your work ethic and the work you deliver - it\'s a lovely comic!!\nRegarding your interest in monetization and such, I think you\'ve got the numbers for the Tapas ad revenue program, but it\'s...not much of a secret that ad rev for small creators is absolutely dead, so unless you\'re very dedicated to make something for extremely broad mass appeal, I wouldn\'t bother on that front specifically. Glancing at your comment section here and there, I think you\'ve got a small but dedicated audience that really enjoys these characters and I can see this comic (and/or potential future work) gathering a community that would be willing to chip in a little via Patreon or Ko-Fi - this is heavily case by case, but it\'s often far less about having crazy subscriber numbers and rewards on Patreon, and more about letting your audience be a part of your personal narrative and regularly reminding them that there are ways to support what you do if/when you do decide to set up a profile on those types of platforms.\nIn terms of getting featured, you\'ve got a good number of the basics down - full color, legibility on mobile, consistent updates are all things that work in your favor. Long episodes in scrolling style are generally preferred on modern platforms, so if the prospect of getting featured eventually (and appealing to the mobile-only audience) is very important to you, it could be worth reformatting the pages. It\'s not the absolute be-all and end-all, and you could find yourself featured for completely different reasons, or on different platforms - don\'t be afraid to reach out to website staff, especially if you\'ve got some sort of event going on. (Streaming the comic creation process for charity? Hosting a webcomic D&D session? Events like that are great for getting people involved and possibly being talked about later!)\nIf you\'ll allow one last suggestion, I think the art would benefit from even more confidence in its shading or experiments with the lineart. During the intermissions I noticed that your art really pops without the shading, probably because the solid black lineart lends itself well to either no shading or cel shading, whereas the actual comic frequently uses much more subtle air brush-y shading. The shadows on the recent pages are a lot more defined than on the early ones though, so maybe this is already something you\'re working on! There are so many fantastic visual elements in this comic, particularly how the color choice sets the atmosphere and details like the magic/battle effects, I\'m really looking forward to seeing how it\'ll continue improving throughout future updates.\nAnd...I think that\'s about it! Thank you for posting, this is exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for and I thoroughly enjoyed it ^^ Can\'t wait for the update in a few hours! I\'m really glad to be able to follow their (mis)adventures now.', ""@LannaEXP Wow, I'm just popping in here to say that I think it's great how you're doing such detailed reviews!

I\'ve got ad revenue on and...yeah pretty much what you said. But I hadn\'t thought much about some of the other options outside of Tapas that you suggested, so that definitely gives me some great food for thought! ^_^\nHow to handle the shading has definitely been one of the main aspects I\'ve wrestled with - my schedule adjustment when I started Chapter 4 was mainly motivated by wanting to give myself more time to try to get the shading looking right, because the air brush-y shading in the earlier chapters was really bugging me, but I couldn\'t easily intuit how to make it look better. Now that you mention it though, I\'m intrigued by what you mean in terms of experimenting with the lineart. Is there something specific you would suggest? I\'ve been finding lately that doing the solid lineart is really time consuming and hard on my wrist, but it actually isn\'t an aspect that I\'d thought about experimenting with til now.\nAnyway thank you again for the great feedback, it pretty much made my day!

Is there something specific you would suggest? I've been finding lately that doing the solid lineart is really time consuming and hard on my wrist, but it actually isn't an aspect that I'd thought about experimenting with til now.\nI'm glad you enjoyed the feedback ^o^ Regarding the lineart, personally I'd probably try making thinner lines (maybe using a less solid brush?) and focusing less on how 'clean' they are. If you can afford to draw on higher resolutions, the downscaling is gonna help smooth things out and might give your wrist a bit of a break. (Colored lineart could also look great, but that often ends up being even more work, so probably not ideal right now.)\n--\nFor the next review, I read all currently available episodes of @AceRagz's Life In Staffinburg!\nFirst of all, incredible improvement on the art from the first to the most recent episode! When I started reading, I didn't expect it to go from traditional with minor digital editing to full color digital with such gorgeous lighting on the latest page. If you can find the time inbetween updates, maybe you could update the first episode with the current look (or otherwise show a sample of what the art looks like now). First impressions are really important and people love color and a 'clean' look. It might help draw in more readers.\nI enjoy the character designs, even more so once the comic adds color as it helps distinguish them more and shows off some cool design elements that remained under the radar in b/w. Throughout the comic, there are a lot of panels that are just close-ups in repeating angles which I'd suggest toning down a little bit. The designs are fun and the faces are very expressive, so the close-ups are good but the balance between those and more varied panels is a little out of whack. There's this one panel focusing on the threatening look of a big open jaw which worked really well - in fact a lot of the fight-based scenes were great, made fantastic use of the characters' animal features and conveyed the feeling of threat really well. It's also worth noting that we get a good sense of the environment the characters are in. The inside of the bar is particularly well-done.\nThe pacing, to me, is really enjoyable - things are moving forward while also taking the time to give relevant flashbacks or well-timed comedy (like the final two panels of Another Chance Maybe?). I think the drama suffers a bit from too much exposition and repetition in the dialogue; the characters often sound like they're explaining the situation to the reader more than like they're actually having a conversation. This could be fixed through a little more editing and really asking yourself what the characters would actually say versus what the reader needs to learn in this scene (and how that could be conveyed visually instead). The speech bubbles are often a tad long when it feels like the characters all display raw emotions that would probably be expressed in much shorter lines.\nLooking past that, the characters and their emotions are at the core of every drama of course, and they absolutely do shine in this story. I get the feeling that these characters have been developed for a long time and it shows in their overall interaction and how their history together is portrayed. The premise of having gained and then lost fame lends itself really well to interesting conflicts between different types of characters - the misconceptions of what being famous means, the jealousy, the ridicule, it's all present. It's reminiscent of some drama plays I've read and enjoyed lots; everything is kind of gritty and depressing, but just like in real life, there's awkward moments and situational comedy happening here and there. The atmosphere is absolutely on point.\nOverall Life In Staffinburg feels like a classic dramedy in ways I don't really see anymore nowadays, with many interesting elements in its main conflict and character interactions that I think will really shine with a little more polish. It's already shown strong improvements since it started a few months ago, and there's a lot of potential there. Keep up the great work!"", ""This was what I was hoping for when I asked for a review! Thank you so much for all your suggestions towards improving my work. I truly appreciate that. I plan to start implementing some of these suggestions as soon as I can to help improve the comic.

I left a lot of comments on your story already, but I generally don't like to leave critiques on the actual story cause I think it's bad etiquette, so I'll leave you one here, instead!\nTo start off, like I wrote on the story, I think you're a really fantastic writer and you have great instinct for describing scenes and lines of action in a way that is fun to read but is also easy for the reader to imagine which is great! Similarly, I think you're doing a great job building up and developing all the characters so far! Railynn has a defined personality, motivation, and I root for her! I also like Pik; he seems pretty ruthless, but also cold and intelligent which I like! I also really like that you didn't just dump a lot of inf on the reader by having a full paragraph about what faeries and all these other magical creatures are; you incorporated it at a good and logical pace.\nOne personal, nitpicky critique of mine is that I think the characters' physical attributes may be a little overdescribed. Otherwise, I think you're off to a really good start. My other suggestions would be to skim the story and look out for typos and certain sentences/descriptions that could be cleaned up a little.\nIt's pretty early on, so I don't have many critiques. Something I would look out for concerning Railynn is to consider how powerful she is, however. It's early on in the story and she's wicked strong (physically) I would just make sure that you balance out her power with some character flaws which it seems like you're already doing a good job with. You can also consider the kind of damage she can do to anyone she loves since she has such considerable power. \nOtherwise, keep doing what you're doing!

Chapter one wasn't eventful regardless of the event and as i continue, the dialogue keeps pushing me away."", "" This doesn't really tell me anything other than the fact, you read one chapter. You could at least give me something to go out off. Like how to improve the pacing."", ""With all due respect, and i'm really trying to give you the benefit of the doubt every few pages, reading the dialogue and ignoring it's problems. If it's not the dialogue, the pacing drags the story like a rhythm. Not much of a romantic story, or even fluff. Here's what i think it's supposed to be: a romantic dramedy. It's not very romantic, drama feels empty, and there is no comedy.\nI recommend you either develop a more engaging plot, fluff this out, or scrap it. Sorry to be blunt, but it's only my opinion."", 'mm, I\'m not really a huge romance person, so feel free to ignore me, but it does seem like if you\'re gonna draw something, (because it\'s SO much work) there has to be a set-piece to it. Like this will be 15-30 pages (I\'m guessing, because long format is so long) so it needs something visually exciting that will make you want to keep drawing it.\nAs it is right now, it feels like mostly people talking to eachother, which isn\'t bad at all, it\'s just that in comic format all that talking back and forth is boring to look at if there isn\'t something else going on in the background to break it up, and that type of dialogue is more interesting as a book, and it can be written a lot quicker than a comic. So that part when you added the archery during their conversation--that was good for a comic, that would be something visually exciting to look at.\nThe party could also be a fun Great-Gatsby inspired set-piece since it\'s 10 grand, but it\'s only there in the beginning. And then later, there is the museum date, which could also be a cool set piece? (like most romance movies take place in cool cities just so they can make it visually interesting although it\'s mostly talking) But, overall, I think this story is mostly about the dialogue so...I don\'t know if it needs to be a comic as it stands right now. Unless it were suddenly taking place in London or Paris and had the Eiffel tower in the background to be a cute set-piece.\nLike it might be a fun illustrated short novel? So you draw some scenes that are visually exciting, and then the rest is just--written out dialogue? So like in between a comic and a book?\nBut overall, it\'s a very sweet story where nothing all that bad happens. Like, the only tension is her overcoming her ex, and dealing with some awkwardness from her parents and that\'s smoothed out pretty quickly. And while she does run into her ex during her archery date, and I\'m supposed to think that she\'s overcome the past, it isn\'t really clear that she\'s ""over"" him. I mean she passed out when she saw him so...she\'s not. It didn\'t seem like it had an ending yet. She still has to resolve her ex fully.', ""I think you can build on this by adding more tension. That's whats missing for me too. External conflict needs to happen, and happen earlier than it does. \nSuggestions given your setup: a fistfight breaks out, a robbery happens nearby, hackers want to use her phone to do something crazy, urban fantasy involving killer Black warlocks, a gangster kidnaps a small boy and what does she do, running away after she witnesses a crime her Congresswoman is involved in. Lots of options.\nYou have colorful characters, good depth, and nice dialogue. I say keep it up if you like what you've written."", 'Ironically, when I had an ex who cheated on me. That line of questioning filtered into my next relationships. I never really got the closure from that until about a year ago. Back to the task at hand....how do I build the whole getting over the ex thing. Also I might have set my goals too high as I wanted to do fifty chapters. XD.', ""How do I improve pacing? I really don't see anything wrong with the dialogue. I'm not scraping the story. I'll add to it.\nBut how do I improve the pacing?"", 'Thank you . External conflict....I should be able to think of something.', 'Well if it\'s pacing you wanna fix you always have to consider the writing like food your feeding to someone. You have to satisfy some hungers with either something of greet quantity and good value, or something of small quantity and great value. It\'s very tricky to do this and as long as you understand what your characters would do in each situation, where the story is going, and how this can all stay glued together in the mean time, you could maybe make a good story. \nAs it stands, every small event you put in front of readers just feels like you\'re too afraid or too inexperienced to venture into each action. The romance feels like an awkward dance that somehow gets connected cause two people really wanted a kiss. \nThe ex drama feels odd since you keep introducing Renee\'s ex into the story like either someone we need to hate but can\'t get rid of, or some odd problem that makes us sick.(why did she pass out?) It seemed like Renee and Jason had an awkward relationship as well and he cheated cause of that. This is probably not why he cheated but that\'s what i\'m feeling.\nHer friend either has no time on her hands or she\'s living vicariously through Renee cause her help feels like a friendship based on obsession. Her actions were just to help the main character and nothing else. \nThe comedy feels off like adult speech in a kids show format. Which brings up the dialogue as a whole. If it\'s meant to accent the comedy, you need comedy. \nAnd that archery scene didn\'t make sense to me cause the rules of the game kept throwing me off. First, if the loser is making breakfast or lunch, shouldn\'t the winner get a free meal? Seemed like a bizarre way to add more bonding time between Renee and Trevor. And the winner of the game was determined by questions, not the archery. So what was the point of the archery. I get you could get people bonded over similar hobbies, but if I like racing cars with someone and the only way i can cross the finish line is if i win some trivia during the race, i\'d be confused. \nHospital scene was bizarre in it\'s circumstance. Don\'t know why Renee passed out. If it was really cause Jason causes her to feel so much stress to the point of unconsciousness, i\'d say she either isn\'t over him or she\'s a lightweight. Either one could be understandable if we knew more about their relationship other than the breakup. \nAnd the birthday scene was uneventful, regardless of how you described it. If you were going for a ""will they, won\'t they"", it didn\'t go anywhere cause it was obvious they would be together. Not cause it\'s a trope, but because there was nothing keeping them apart. Not even Jason. And coming from what I told you above, that doesn\'t make sense. Unless this is one of Renee\'s flaws.\nAll these moments needed not only something more, but something less awkward. It\'s like when you go for a driving test but you\'re going slow and still somehow swerving.', ""Ya, I know how it is, I always start with a long story and cut out like...half the script once I realize I have to draw it. I think you began to illustrate her getting over her ex with imagery when she broke the glass at the party--that was a nice visual note. But, from that point on it was like Renee was taking some steps backwards, as she began to have a relationship with someone else. Like showing is more important than telling, and although she says she's over it, she's still thinking of Jason, she's still running into him, she clearly hasn't told her parents that he got another girl pregnant because they think he's a wonderful boy and put his face on her cake, youknow?\nLike--for an idea I'm just gonna throw out there, you can ignore this--but Jason loves archery as much as her, so what if when they split she stopped doing it? It's really common when you're not over someone to still avoid the things that the two of you shared--let it be music or a game or a TV show or whatever. One of the signs that you are recovered is when you go back to something you once loved and you don't feel that heartache anymore. So that way, you can show visually--look, she's overcoming her past, and she's reclaiming her territory, and she feels powerful. And yeah, it can still hurt to talk to that person...but probably not to the point of passing out. Once you're over someone it mostly just feels like regret, youknow? No longer that knife pain."", '@rajillustration Ah, I should probably go back and edit that. Your idea is wonderful and I should probably include this. Well, some portion of this.

","[""This is an interesting one to review. It's a very well drawn and written superhero comic that makes great use of public domain characters like Phantoma, but I also found the structure really confusing. Pages and segments seemed to repeat in places, and the sections with the ads interspersed, while a fun nod to print comics, felt hard to get through.\nI think the biggest hurdle for me was the lack of a point of view character. It was like reading the space-opera-esque 80s X-men stuff, like the Dark Phoenix Saga, or one of the big DC multiverse type stories, but without establishing an emotional connection to anyone in order to make me really care about the outcome or understand the stakes on a human level. The prose was extremely well written, and it reminded me of the epic melodrama of Claremont or even Moore's work in a good way, but there was so much of it, pages and pages of feeling lost in a huge, dizzying multiverse without an emotional anchor, which with the repetition of pages made me feel like I was wandering in circles.\nThe art is great, I sort of wish it was in bold, pulpy colours, but I understand that colour would be more work on top of a comic that already has excellent, detailed line work and strong use of values. It nicely balances a modern digital look with a pulp feel, so it's hard to complain.\nHonestly it's really just the repetition of pages and lack of a PoV character that make the comic hard to get into. I absolutely wanted to enjoy it because everything else is very high quality here.""]",9/25/2019 11:29,https://forums.tapas.io/t/requesting-a-review-of-the-power-of-stardust-issue-1/37523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
420,Review my Webtoon,Reviews | Feedback,[],"This is the third time I'm uploading this comic onto Webtoons because the first two times I went on a long hiatus and deleted the comic twice.

The Adventures of Marty and Jeff
The glorious planet of Eden has been hidden from humanity for thousands of years. Without it, the Nimra Stream Galaxy cannot remain in paradise. A great number of Luminous Children have been sent out to find it yet have failed to do so for many...





The Adventures of Marty and Jeff49","['Hey, I\'m no pro but  I think it\'s nice. It\'s got a pretty cool concept that can work if done right.. The prologue was just kind of exposition-y. Like the mention that ""not all luminous are children"" could have been just said by a character later on.\nThe art is very basic but I do feel a sense of effort and inspiration. (looking at you BNHA freckles) Good luck on improving it. You seem to be aware of it, but I suggest looking at anatomy references from time to time.\nAlso, since you\'re on a webcomic platform, I suggest chopping up the dialogue a bit between multiple panels since it\'s too wordy. I mean, personally I got used to that since I grew up reading manga... but if you are aiming to be featured someday, webtoons love short dialogue. Also, try taking out lines that don\'t really matter. Simple bantering okay. but dropping too much information too quick is a no-no.', 'About INTRODUCTION: I know it\'s basically a prologue, so the info dump isn\'t totally out of place, but grammatically, it reads either as a first draft or as if written by a grammatically inexperienced person. Try to spice up your sentences, be a little more creative, and try to remain coherent.\nAn example would be the parts where you mention how adults can also be Luminous Children... I don\'t know if that section is even necessary, but the way the sentence is paired with the ""one purpose"" of the Luminous Children... They don\'t really belong together.\nAbout PROLOGUE PT. 1: I\'m not gonna say much about the art... It needs work, but everyone does, so just keep doing what you gotta do. The dialogue is extremely clunky and unnatural. You can communicate the same information with fewer words. I don\'t know if this is intentional, but I don\'t like Marty so far...\nFor example, ""We still have a few more miles to walk, unfortunately."" could easily be broken down to ""Still a few more miles, unfortunately."" There are plenty of examples of these kinds of overly long sentences.\nPROLOGUE PT. 2 pretty much has all the same problems as Pt. 1.\nOverall, it\'s an interesting premise. Dialogue needs work for sure. Sentence structure also needs work. Keep improving your art. I\'m not quite sure why these 2 installments need to be apart of a ""prologue"" and aren\'t just chapter\'s one and two already, but that\'s no big deal.', 'Thanks for the feedback. I will be sure to make improvements.', ""Thanks for the feedback. I will make sure to improve and apply your advice. However, I will say that for Marty, I intended for him to be this rambunctious, silly and over the top character, but as the series progresses he learns to be more laid back, restrained, and considerate. I've got most of my inspiration from the character Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece (if you know who that is.)"", ""I mean you've done a pretty good job considering this is new ground for you to make a comic so I don't want to get picky about the art at all. Storywise, there's some parts that are somewhat illogical to me, like having them walk 32 miles unsupervised and without food (which small children who are like 10 years old cannot physically do) although the Dad has a car. Like yes, the Dad wants his kids to be strong or whatever but like that's basically child abandonment. I would look at the logic and ask if some things are necessary if they only make things a little more confusing, especially when you have this young 10 yo kid punching out his Dad (which most 10 yo would not be able to do) and then the Dad grounds him not because he got punched out, but because the kid was disrespectful to his machine? The characters are somewhat confusing on what they decide to get upset about."", ""In terms of art, I think you need references to help you as I can see that you're doing this all without it.I feel that the style you're going for is Shonen Manga.So what I suggest is that, before you continue, go and brush up on some other shonen manga and use them as a reference when you're composing shots. I didn't say copy mind you, referencing is different. I want you study the shots in each panel and figure out the feelings they convey.\n\nviz.com3\n\n\n\nVIZ: Read Free Shonen Jump Manga - Official & Simul with Japan\nThe world's most popular manga!

The drawing needs more practice especially the background and anatomy and or perspective. The basics needs more work as far as i can tell', ""The 32 mile walk, Marty punching his dad, and the parents getting upset at Marty for not liking their machine was put in there really only for the beginning to be silly and ridiculous. I intended it to start out funny and lighthearted and then gradually get serious within the next few chapters. Those weren't meant to be taken seriously. I appreciate the feedback though."", 'I gave the comic a read on my break at work, so now that I\'m home here\'s a quick review \nArt:\nOff to a nice start so far! I\'ll skip straight to some specific areas that I think could use some additional work/attention beyond the things that you\'ve already identified (i.e. anatomy, etc.). The first area that could use some additional detail I think are your backgrounds and especially some of the outside landscapes. I\'ll start by saying that it\'s great that you\'re not shying away from them! Some people try to dodge the problem by not including many backgrounds at all, but on the contrary your comic has them sprinkled throughout in most panels which is an awesome start. Specifically what I think could help them improve is just additional detail added to various aspects. For example, the beginning and end of the prologue happen in this grassy hilly area, but it\'s just very basic and kind of bland. The hills are flawless curves with no texture, there\'s no additional things in the landscape besides grass and road, etc. Much like the other commenters suggesting using references for poses and anatomy, using references for backgrounds can be super helpful too  hitting google to look up inspiration can be a huge asset. For example looking through some photos like these:\n\n\n\n\nimage.png661x507 402 KB\n\n\n\n\ncan start to give some ideas of other elements that can be added to spice it up (trees, rocks, fencing, animals, etc.) Similarly the interior scene could use a little definition as well. The scale and nature of the space almost reminds me of something like an airplane building facility:\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nSome ceiling trusses and perhaps exposed structure in the walls instead of being finished with sheet rock are a few small things that would add a lot of dimension and interest to the scene \nAnd then something that really shows off the contrast is how detailed the car is in that scene, since it\'s a 3D model, vs. the rest of the scenery that you hand drew. Not to say everything has to be super duper detailed, especially if you\'re going for a simpler style, but the car definitely stands out. Something to think about.\nTHAT SAID I already see tons of improvement happening across all aspects of the art from Prologue 1 to Prologue 2. The shading improves a ton already, and I see some experimentation happening with the clouds in the sunset, blades of grass starting to pop up and texture the ground a little, etc I\'d say just keep it up!\nStory/Dialogue: \nIt\'s very early on so there\'s not much to say about the story itself, but here are my initial thoughts:\nthe introduction detracts from the experience more than it adds, I think. It reads like a promotional commercial or like monologue at the start of a cartoon rather than the actual start of the story. By the time I was done reading Prologue 2 I had already forgotten what the introduction was even about as I was far more interested in what was going on with Marty and Alice. I fully agree with @liann that the info presented there could probably all be woven into the story more effectively than as an info dump up front. The scene with Marty staring at the Eden poster in the lab curious about what it is could open up a dialogue with his parents in the coming episodes about what it is, for example. I would evaluate perhaps removing that episode so that people can get straight to the good stuff.\nAs far as the actual plot thus far, it\'s interesting enough so far but a few things stand out. as @rajillustration already pointed out, a lot of the details being presented seem random or arbitrary in a non-cohesive way. Having to walk specifically 32 miles, it taking 5 hours randomly, the family waiting outside for Marty for 2 hours... everything just seems kind of extreme and over the top for the sake of it. I\'m not sure how much we the reader get from getting told these random tidbits. Each time I encountered these hyperbolic instances I just thought to myself ""huh?"" or ""wtf no one\'s parent in their right mind would wait outside in the running car for that long without going in to fetch the kid especially when he\'s alone and in the parent\'s place of work"" xD \nFurther I\'m not sure if it\'s intentional, but none of the characters are particularly likeable yet, which makes for a bit of a rocky start. Marty\'s rude and over the top all the time, the parents are like... low-to-mid key abusive, and Jeff started out kind of enigmatic/alright but he\'s proven to be kind of a jerk in the car scene as well. Alice stands out as being kind of the voice of reason and character that I\'ve been able to relate to the most. Like I feel her pain here xDDD\n\nimage.png791x454 129 KB\n\nNothing stands out as particularly jarring (besides the bizarre interaction with the parents in the first episode) but having most of the cast be hard-to-like jerks toward one another, especially in the first few episodes make it hard to relate to them and get invested. Much like the art though, this is something that I\'m sure will improve with time as you get more and more experiences with writing stories and dialogue  \nFinally regarding this bit:\n\n\nolafemi96:\nI am aiming for this series to get moved to Originals on Webtoon.

422,"Promo your comic, get a free song maybe! (Reviews)",Reviews | Feedback,[],"In reference to my last thread17, I said y'all were gonna get reviews. I spent a lot of today reading and didn't get enough time to test any of my ideas out lol but here they are, all together in varying lengths and quality. The ones with asterisks are the ones that I had ideas for, but I'll leave it at that.. since the announcement of which comics I picked to write music for comes out tomorrow.
My reviews of all 42 comics you submitted, in order of how you submitted them!
You're My Muse!2 A short, fun time with a socially awkward kid who heavily relies on his knowledge of anime and manga to help himself get through his barely existent love life?? Pffft. Same. Anyways lol I found myself enjoying this lil gem that's not even two weeks old, there wasn't even 10 episodes when it was suggested, but it managed to get a sub outta me when I don't read BL so like yeah.
Otaku-sama1* Ya had me at gaming, ya kept me with your comedy. The jabs at some of the games really got me lol and it was endearing seeing Panpan's first steps into becoming a gamer, really reminded me of how I grew up learning stuff as I went along. Real cutesy, real nice, man, I subbed. I had small ideas and I wanted to do 'em in chiptune.. But it turned to be harder than I thought, so yeah. This would’ve been one of the songs if I knew how to produce sounds like that.
BlunderlandLooking back on this after reading a bunch.. I remember it being absurd-ish humor with lots of spanking bare booty lol got something you wanna explain there buddy? xD For real though uhhh, some of the humor didn’t land for me, sorry to say. It actually weirdly reminds me of Family Guy, for some reason? At around 50 episodes that’s when I checked out, real apprehensive about subbing. I figured that if the rest of the comic was like what I just read, it probably wasn’t gonna be for me. Of course, maybe stuff changed by the time you got to more recent episodes, but yeah, those are my thoughts.
Life in Staffinburg There’s a lot of moodiness, drinking, and trying to get over a girl. Which is relatable, even though I don’t drink lol it’s a drama, through and through, but it's a bit of a dreary one. Aside from that, I wanna mention that it reminds me of Bojack Horseman and how it explores some depressive emotions. (As far as I know, anyways. I’ve yet to watch it.) So if you're a fan of that type of story, maybe this one's for you to check out.
Home is a Distant WishSmugglers in the future find a man smuggling himself and get real offended xD Real talk, I don't remember the details of the story, but I strongly remember the pink-haired guy. He's a sassy boi, and I liked his overall demeanor and attitude. Worth a sub though, and I needa go back and reread it.
Hexameron2*“It’s kinda like Stranger Things or IT!” ..I bet you get that a lot lol but it’s true! Seeing kids deal with the dark scary stuff of the world is always a fun concept to mess around with. I'm glad to be coming around to it as the first arc just finished recently. I'm digging the chemistry that the kids have together bc it really feels like they're all friends. I also appreciate the spooky vibes and fun times, you hit a nice balance of comedy and horror. Subbed for more!
There Was a War1* Snappy review: Lots of history, lots of brooding from a prisoner, and lots of two girls having cute chemistry together. Very pretty, and I really like the color choices. In short, I really liked it, and I subbed to this!
Hue Are You?1 Some of these robots feel more human than actual human characters in other Premium comics, change my mind. (Not gonna name any just so we’re clear lol) Ok, ok, but in all honesty.. I wasn’t really rocking with it at first. Real talk, I thought the art was bulky, and that that was a bad thing, but come to find several episodes later, I can’t really imagine the art being any other way that would fit. It’s actually charming to me now, because I grew to like the few characters and their designs that the story featured so far. So, because it ended up being a total turn around on my initial thoughts, I subbed to it. 
The Bride of Arran So, soulmates are supposed to be a thing in this universe, and this prince and some random lady are the ones for each other. She's not into that due to her past, and that certainly complicates things. His men come get her though, and that's sorta where we currently are. An interesting premise, for sure, and I wanna see how the plot unfolds. I personally want her to not end up with the prince, but we'll see! Subbed.
Celestial Chronicles Shion* The thumbnail alludes to a romance and that's what I assumed it was gonna be, but so far it's been a lot of action, and you know what? I'm not disappointed in the slightest. It just works, man, and with where I left off it seems like our main character has some visions and stuff to deal with. Stuff I wanna see continue on in the future, obviously, bc I subbed.
Keith and Jeremy's Mystical MysteriesA really short and sweet review. Snarky with promise of mystery! I'm liking it, and I’m digging the art. You get a sub from me!
Memento Mori - Sins* Was looking forward to this bc of you mentioning your character playing Chopin, and my hype didn't disappoint based on the story.. however, the amount of episodes left much to be desired! I wanted to see more madness unfold as the protagonist, deals with.. the guys.. (they're with the mafia, right?), but it gets cut at a good moment since you're still putting the episodes out. Easy sub for me.
DRGN / Edible Green Tea / Alpha AlpacaThe only one who recommended 3 comics and as such, I'll be blunt and quick with my thoughts! DRGN, a strong idea of your own, I assumed it'd be a big story, but at 9 episodes long, you decided to reboot it already?! Didn't see the point in subbing unless you planned to put the reboot there as well. Edible Green Tea, first episode has a Jojo reference, the dogs are great, and it's got quick snappy humor, sometimes it's a real bop, subbed. Alpha Alpaca issue 1, bit of a classic superhero, it drags on a bit for me, narration's fun though. Issue 2, Pup Team Epic was fun! A bit dependent on references, but whatever, it made me laugh, would sub to that as its own thing.
Forest SpiritsFurry forest dude runs away from burning village and runs into a girl doesn't like him, and they proceed to spend the entire next day together to meet a mean mom and a nice grandma. That's the plot right now. Not too much of a story yet, but it's interesting enough to watch 'em grow a bond together, so I subbed to see where it goes!
Rocky the Rock1 People are dumb and they follow a rock, meanwhile others die to that same rock, 11/10 best meme. Subbed.
The WASP / Tiger on the Storm* The hardest and easiest reads for me. I have a huge aversion to history, and I read them at my most exhausted for one of the days. Bad idea. Came back to them later with a fresh mind and few episodes left on both and it changed my approach. The WASP felt like a more informational look at a series of women in military, along with detailed descriptions and images of aircraft. Super educational. It was harder for me to get into due to the fact that everything felt disconnected to me, but that's sorta the nature of sharing different stories. Tiger on the Storm, however, is an easier read as it follows one man basically writing down his eventful days in a journal. Definitely felt more engaged and I ended up subbing to this one.
ROYAL Super quick review. High school anime kids beat the crap out of each other and a teacher does weird stuff to a student. I'm a sucker for shonen so 10/10, subbed. 
Detox*A magical Latina drug smuggler in the future gets caught in a riot and hides away with the goodies, she delivers said goodies to a group she's chill with, but not all of 'em. I wonder whyyyy. Now it's day of the dead and she's incognito. Super interesting premise, I'd be down to see more the plot for sure! Just gonna sneak a sub in here...
Crystal CrownIt honestly felt like we went from the beginning of the story to its final arc in such a short span of time, but weirdly enough, there's more after that? There were times I felt like it was way too rushed, sure, but at the same time, the fact that it takes no time develop certain aspects actually made me interested in seeing how stuff played out with the little build up that there was. Ya weirdly won me over xD you get a sub from me!
A Rough Sketch1Honestly, the description speaks for itself. Lots of pop culture, gaming and sci-fi references and memes. All of which I was really into, but what stood out to me the most was the One Year Later pair of episodes. It's always refreshing to see someone take a break from doing funny stuff to just be real with the audience for a sec. I personally loved that, and wouldn't mind seeing more, but that's just me. Subbed~
LnR1*A slow burn romance for sure, and despite that, I found myself wanting L and R to just skip past development and get together already. I'm sorry, but their chemistry is too good to keep 'em apart! But it's not all romance,though! The titular characters have their own fulfilling lives outside of love, and the family bonds that they share with the supporting cast are very present here, and not only are these present.. they're just good, and convincing. Subbed before I finished my reading through it~
SISUVery short comic at 4 episodes, the comedy is very slapstick style which is kid friendly, but the subject matter might not be? xD I had a good laugh at the title of the first episode, ""Titpad"", and the recommendations being so far away from the comedy in the comic lol So, I don't know how to review this properly, what I thought was funny came out of everything else outside the actual comic. I'm not sure if it comes off mean (in which case, I'm sorry!), but those are my real thoughts!
Hearts a Mess / Who Are You?Two BLs and both are quick reads! Who Are You? is the much quicker one of the two and the story is very minimal, as it's 5 episodes in they're very short. Hearts a Mess is longer and has more of a story to sink into, in comparison. One's a heartbroken guy who'd rather avoid catching feelings for another guy, the other.. well, he's got no hang-ups about getting closer. I'm not exactly attached to anyone in either story yet, but I can safely say that both stories look promising! 
Looking for Oasis* Dimitri might've lost an arm, but he's gaining friends..? Pretty even trade. A sweet woman and her creature brother take in this stray man, and help him get on his feet, which when you think about it.. that's pretty wholesome. Far as I remember there's not that much of a plot where I left off at, but I can smell it comin'! Subbed!
Flower Field1I don't remember too much of this one, sorry to say.. my head can only retain so much plot of everything apparently lol I do remember this one messing around with the lineage of a kingdom with someone who was adopted however. That much alone seemed to be interesting enough though, so subbed.
CicatrixSurprisingly, not the shortest entry here lol for a single episode though, it does a good job of setting the scene. We're following this boy telling his side of the story for what seems to be a crime he didn't commit? Not entirely sure, but there's definitely an investigation.. one that I'm interested in seeing unravel a potential mystery. This gets a sub from me!
EverdreamSo, so far there's no big overarching plot that I can see yet, but it feels like these separate stories are gonna all come together at some point, and truth be told, I'm here for it! I'm enjoying all the character interactions so far, as well as the little hints of the past or the world that we get. Good stuff, man! Gonna give it a sub!
Unearthing Hope Overly simplified review, schoolboy in a fantasy world encounters a dwarf girl during a sexy parade, he becomes an assistant for her shop, things get magical and then gay for our protagonist, and there's scary stuff the next morning. All this in 3 episodes. It's super pretty and the most visually appealing out of all these comics in color, at least I think so. I recommend it, bc I subbed real quick
SENSE*Since there's not much to cover here, I'll leave this short and to the point. I'm into this, and I'm not gonna get into plot points, but to be real with you, it looks like it has so much potential to be a really interesting story. Easy sub.
LottaAn isekai anime- ah, it's cartoony, never mind. Gold at the end of the rainbow they always say, but little do they know that there's an alternate plane of reality in between dimensions! Lotta and her pet raccoon (it's a red panda, raccoon just sounds funnier lol) explore this quirky fantasy world where I've inexplicably given everyone Irish accents! A fun read for sure, and I love Gragnor's standoffish nature tbh. Subbed.
Grimoire AthenaeumNot much to say.. Guy gets texts from an ex-boyfriend he's not over.. Then he moves in to work with him as if he definitely wouldn't be playing with fire. It's a BL, but there's wizardry?? I saw floating fireballs, dunno what that's about… Gonna sub bc I'm curious to see how this all goes together~
Radioactive Underground Quick review! Sci-fi ragtag group of nerds with diamond heist! Sign me up! Potential ships? We got 'em, babyyyy. Bopping ways through several security guards? It's right there! You ask me what I think, and I raise you a sub!
Oddly Vanilla*Short stories can pack a punch, you know.. Short reviews? Not so much. It's kinda hit or miss on the stories so far for me.. I either love it or feel indifferent. But one thing remains the same, I really enjoy the narrators introducing the stories. It's definitely one for me to keep an eye on, so I just had to sub.
Teach a stray dog how to love 2.0Yori almost gets mugged, Rokudo stops the dudes, now Yori is being pushy pushy with friendship, not knowing that Rokudo's in a gang. Honestly? I don't like Yori lol he's a cinnamon roll type of character, fine, but he needs to learn to take no for an answer oh my goddd the amount of times Rokudo rejects him multiple times but he's all like ""but you need a friend uwu"" just.. ugh I don't like him lol it's not for me, but hey, I like the gang stuff, so there's that! .. But this is a BL, so we're probably not gonna focus on that xD
Melissa and Julianna Comics!Super cartoony slice of life comedy stuff. You got a girl essentially laughs at everything, and her bestie who broods about everything, and a grandma who'd honestly wreck you up whether she meant to or not. The comedy's a little more on the simple side, which.. having this as my final read after all this isjust.. very welcome. Simple is good sometimes. Subbing is good too.
Frontier-0 Origins2* I'll keep it brief enough.. Loved it from the first pages, gave me a balanced dose of laughs and feels. There's just something about it that I latched onto real quick, dude. Subbed before I finished reading all the way through. I think this one might be my favorite all around!
Burning Shadow Another quick read, another quick review! We get lore, then see a girl go to a market, and later, she flies to a friend's house. That same night, she fights this stalker, and she probably dies. Roll credits. RIP IN PEACE. I had fun reading through it and spamming you with likes lol it looks promising for sure! Sub!
Wrath of White WolfA very dense fantasy world, with quite a bit of lore behind.. everything? The story's a bit of a blur to me, but I feel like that's what happens when you're trying to talk about over 40 comics in one go. I remember raids, and that's it really, but the progression made sense, and I'd keep reading it if not for this list of others to get to lol. It's very detailed black and white imagery, which.. dude, some scenes where the focus is just on the landscape is beautiful. Specifically, whenever you draw plants, ohhhhhh my god, the linework is something else. Subbed to continue reading!
Knights Chronicles Y'all like giant mech battles, right? It's got quite a few here. How about aliens? This comic's got you covered. Enslavement of humanity? That's a check too. I personally preferred the parts where it was showing humanity struggling to keep up with.. the aliens.. in the war, but it seems like you wanted to take a different direction after a few chapters. While I didn't like the change from such a big scope being narrowed down to following one character, I can see it working for other people!

And with that, I'm gonna leave this here, and get to work on my musical ideas immediately  This was real fun, you guys, thanks for participating in this little project~ ","[""thanks for the review not as bad as i had feared. I will be the first to admit mine is a somewhat misunderstood comic as my British humour is often not understood by American Audience. The comic started out with the comics of my youth in mind and if you read old issues of the beano and Dandy from 70's England you will see characters such as Dennis the Mennis (the English version) and Rodger the dodger getting in trouble each week and mostly ending up with dads slipper across their hide. I wanted to keep the spirit of this comic element alive but sadly in these days of PC alot of people find it more uncomfortable than funny, hence i changed the format of the story to a more adventure spin and have had to plan scenes that are only for the paid issues in book two (book two is more about adventure although i do have to keep that sidekick of mine in line) anyhow thanks again for the review (i normally hate them but not this one)  I hope you will give blunderland book 2 a shot it's been written in a different way."", ""thanks for the review!! you're too kind \ngood luck music-making, im really exciting to see what you make!"", 'Thank you so much for the review!', ""Thank you for the review  !\nIndeed I was not been able to publish many episodes by now, probably because it's not my full-time job and I put a lot of heart in each of the pages.I want the design to be ok after all!

423,“Selling” Free Comic Reviews! (Closed),Reviews | Feedback,[],"Update: I'm capping the reviews until I get the next few updates of my comic finished. 
Alright, so I'm not really selling reviews. 
Today, I posted the third episode of my new comic, called Removed. This might not seem like the biggest deal, and there's a good chance the word ""whatever"" is on the tip of your tongue. Well, episode three is a bit of a big deal for me, because episode three is the furthest I've ever gotten in posting a comic. Some of you might know me from the Tapas Times last May, and while I loved the idea of a newspaper comic, I had to drop it with of school getting in the way. But now I'm back, and I've been working to be more productive than ever.
So, in celebration of this momentous occasion, I'm offering free reviews for YOUR comic! 
The catch? 
I'd appreciate it if you gave my comic a peep. You don't have to subscribe or heart or anything, but just give it a chance, and if you like it, you can stick around. I won't really know if you got a review and didn't lay a single eye on the webpage, but it'd be lovely if you'd be willing to give me a chance. Removed is a horror/thriller comic based in the world of a certain recognizable video game (although it should be noted that the game isn't essential to the storyline, so you can read it without any prior knowledge), and you can read it here13. 
Alright, so how do you get your comic reviewed? 

Give me that sweet link to your comic
Write a sentence or two about the atmosphere/tone you're going for, or just genre if you don't have a specific tone
If your comic is over 50 updates long, pick which 50-update-span you'd like me to read. While I'd love to do an in-depth review of every comic, I'm not sure it's entirely realistic for longer comics. 

I'd also like to warn people in advance that I tend to do my best to go as in-depth as possible, so I might be giving you a few paragraphs to read. The negatives paragraph also always turns out a bit thicker than the positives, but don't let this scare you- I often have less negatives than positives, I just like to spend more time describing ways to improve. 
If you'd like me to keep an eye out for anything in particular, feel free to also add that to your comment. And if you really like both your review and my comic, maybe share the comic with a friend or give it some love over on the Top Webcomics List2! Thank you, and happy posting!

I\'ll start with the room to grow, and then end on a positive note with the things I really liked. \nSo for starters, the first thing I noticed about the comic is the font. Comic sans is a really fun font, but I\'m not entirely sure it\'s what you\'re going for. You might want to check out some other sans fonts closer to the font Marvel uses (called Benton Sans Extra Comp Black according to Google). Another aspect of the typesetting that could be worked on is the boxes and bubbles, and fitting the text inside of it. Occasionally the text seems like there\'s not enough or too much to fill the space, and they\'re sometimes positioned in locations that feel ""off."" You could fix this by doing your bubbles after the text is down, which allows you to size them around it, and then if you have the text and bubbles on their own layer you could use the transformation tool to move them to a compositionally-pleasing spot. To move from typesetting onto visuals, I noticed some panels are rather grainy and low-res. Since I don\'t know your process, I can\'t say how this happens, but drawing to full scale or saving small drawings that you want to expand as png files could remedy this. And on the topic of quality, this isn\'t major, but the re-using of panels gets to be a bit much sometimes. While there\'s nothing wrong with re-using a panel or two occasionally, if you\'re going to have a long dialogue sequence, you might want to just go in and change each copied panel a tiny bit, even if it\'s just the character\'s mouth, to make it less noticeable to the reader. Lastly, I was slightly confused on an aspect of the worldbuilding: while Frank seems bewildered from just learning that demons exist, it\'s also established that there are groups in place who exterminate these demons. I would recommend making it apparent if demons existence are common knowledge or some sort of secret. \nI hope that wasn\'t too much negativity to throw at you, because I did really like a lot of aspects of this comic! First of all, as I mentioned, the backgrounds. The panel backgrounds, in the beginning episodes especially, do a great job of establishing the setting and really add a lot to the atmosphere, especially the very brown color scheme that really sells the idea of the wild west. The dialogue also really helps with the atmosphere- the characters speak like where they\'re supposed to be from, and the accents are well written in. I also really liked the combination of cross-hatching and simple shading, especially in more dramatic scenes that also had a lot of hatching showing some kind of movement. The additional lines set the mood of intensity really well. I also wanted to praise some improvement I noticed from the beginning to the latest chapters- the pages became slightly more compact so the gutters weren\'t gaping white holes anymore, and the lineart felt much smoother. Both of these changes were really cool to see. And, last but not least, some things I just really liked were Annies hair (the detail in the stray hairs were really cool), the introduction (the writing just hooked me in), the half demon explanation sequence (really interesting visuals) and the demon itself (great job at making a real spooky boy). \nSorry that I just practically wrote you a whole essay, but I hope I wasn\'t too harsh and I can\'t wait to see where your comic goes.', 'A for all ages weekly superhero comic strip.

I don\'t know, but I wanted to say that even though it wasn\'t my comic I really appreciated the amount of time you put into that! You did a really good job of articulating your opinions and things that person could improve, while also balancing your negative comments with positive ones. \nAnd if @perkibd0 would value a second opinion, I\'d say I agree with everything Baguette said, good and bad, though I\'d also add two comments about the art: \n1) You draw people from the same angle, straight on, a lot. It would really bring some variety into your panels and some motion into your action scenes if you changed up the camera angles a bit more. You did do it a bit in your action scenes in the latest chapter, which is cool to see! Though you still draw faces like the same two ways every time, and don\'t have a lot of spine-twisting poses. But I can see clear improvement in your art. \n2) The ""flounder-mouth"" thing when you draw characters from the side is extremely jarring. It just doesn\'t look like a mouth to me, it looks like a hole in the cheek. That kind of thing is usually done in low-budget anime, where they can\'t afford to draw chin movements. It\'s a cheap shortcut, and you\'re a good enough artist to not have to rely on that sort of thing.', ""I am interested in where your comic is going, I will subscribe to it.\nAs for my comic, its a middle eastern fantasy.

The use of color emphasis on the first few pages was so much fun to look at, and I'm such a sucker for a cool gif. I came up with a few things to say, but overall, I really liked your comic. \nIn all, there were only three things I could come up with for room for improvement. For starters, while the coloring is super cool, it could get a little hard to look at in certain places, namely places where the background color has the same value as the foreground color. Since the lineart isn't always crisp, it can be hard to see where one shape ends if the shape is too similar to the background. Something else that I noticed was that even though the way the speech bubbles were broken up helps with the overall aesthetic/pacing of the style, it felt difficult to read because it made. the text. feel. like it had to. be read like. this. Which is fine for more dramatic bits of dialogue, but gets a little tiring when characters are just talking back and forth. Lastly, something I noticed especially on the first few pages was just how overwhelming the page as a whole looked. I really like the yellow-and-black color scheme, but when paired with so many different speech bubbles and white spaces and character poses it just felt a little cluttered. However, the biggest example of this problem I could find is all the way back on page 2, so it's good to see that improvement has been made in that department. \nWith the negatives out of the way, I wanted to say I really love your art style. The sketchy-ness of the lines and the way to colors are laid down makes it look almost effortless, but just the use of colors as shadows and the detail put into backgrounds show that there's so much more going into each page. The changing color schemes help establish different settings without having to spend too much time on opening shots, and I know I said it before but the vibrancy of these colors is just really really fun to look at!! I also really like the flow of the page overall- the pages are more traditional-comic layout but they utilize the added space of webcomics with bubbles and characters popping into the gutter, and it really helps add to the composition of the page as a whole. I subscribed to the comic and I can't wait to see more of your awesome artwork in future updates!"", ""My favorite part about your comic was the drastic improvement from  the beginning to the most recent update. There were at least a handful of issues that I had to go back to and delete from my notes because they got cleared up later, and that was awesome to see. \nSo, the negatives. For starters, something that's drastically grown so far and has room to get a bit farther is the text bubbles. While the text in the initial chapters clearly looked squeezed into its bubbles, the most recent chapter looks much more natural and clean. What I'd like to add to this is that you don't need to cram your text in. While the newer speech bubbles fit all of the text in, it often looks a bit crammed, like the bubble is almost touching the words. A good rule of thumb is that the amount of space between each word should be the same as the amount of space between the piece of text closest to the bubble, and the bubble itself. The other things that I noted generally fell under two topics: colors, and consistency. The colors do also get a lot cleaner through the course of your comic, but the recommendation I have here is to create a general color scheme. Whenever there are panels with a bunch of random background characters or set pieces, it sometimes felt like there were a lot of different, random colors going on. I would recommend just swatching a dozen or so colors and eyedropping these to fill in crowds and backgrounds, to add a sense of coherency to the colors. Now, onto consistency. When it comes to long-running webcomics, consistency isn't the biggest issue- it can be hard to keep things the same issue to issue, and the reader won't notice unless they're bingeing several episodes at a time. However, it is important to keep all the different elements on one page consistent. There were a few times where the size of the characters or text changed around, or the thickness of the lineart would double for one panel and then shrink for the next. You might want to just pay attention to how all your panels look together as a whole, and I would say that closely looking over the preview that Tapas offers you when you go to post a page has definitely helped me in this regard. \nNow, onto the positives. First of all, even from the beginning, you have a solid, recognizable style that does a really good job of showcasing the character's expressions. The expressions of the characters have been important thus far to the plot of your story, so it's really good that they're so apparent. I also liked the detail put into your backgrounds- the backgrounds have a lot of depth and really show off the settings, and it's impressive that you can post so regularly while making these backgrounds.The lack of lineart in the background is also really nice to keeping these backgrounds from looking too overwhelming. Lastly, just  a shoutout to the writing- while I got strong Star Wars vibes, it was never too similar or on point to Star Wars to feel like a total rip off. The dialogue was also really snappy, which is always fun to read. \nThanks for your submission, and good luck with your comic in the future!"", '\n\nBaguette:\nFor starters, while the coloring is super cool, it could get a little hard to look at in certain places, namely places where the background color has the same value as the foreground color. Since the lineart isn\'t always crisp, it can be hard to see where one shape ends if the shape is too similar to the background.\nI know this is a problem for me, and other people have pointed it out as well. It can be hard to see if something is confusing or not to readers, because obviously it\'s never confusing to me, I drew it. It\'s definitely something I\'m trying to be more aware of. \n\n\nBaguette:\nSomething else that I noticed was that even though the way the speech bubbles were broken up helps with the overall aesthetic/pacing of the style, it felt difficult to read because it made. the text. feel. like it had to. be read like. this.\nPart of it is me trying not to overwhelm readers with paragraph-sized bubbles, part of it is me wanting to have pauses in speech, and part of it is me just not planning well and running out of space. I still like small speech bubbles, so I won\'t get rid of that entirely, but I didn\'t realize it can be disruptive to people reading it. So I\'ll try to constrain myself to dramatic bits. Thanks for bringing it up!\n\n\nBaguette:\nI really like the yellow-and-black color scheme, but when paired with so many different speech bubbles and white spaces and character poses it just felt a little cluttered.\nYeah, I think with the week-long gap between updates I wanted to fit as much ""stuff"" into one update as I could in the beginning. I felt like if I didn\'t have something interesting every page, people would leave. But I\'ve realized now that people actually do like my comic and will stick around, and I shouldn\'t sacrifice pacing for my impatience. I\'m glad you think I\'ve improved.\n\n\nBaguette:\nThe sketchy-ness of the lines and the way to colors are laid down makes it look almost effortless, but just the use of colors as shadows and the detail put into backgrounds show that there\'s so much more going into each page.\nThank you!\n\n\nBaguette:\nThe changing color schemes help establish different settings without having to spend too much time on opening shots, and I know I said it before but the vibrancy of these colors is just really really fun to look at!!\nThat\'s exactly what I was going for!\n\n\nBaguette:\nI subscribed to the comic and I can\'t wait to see more of your awesome artwork in future updates!\n<3']",9/6/2019 20:46,https://forums.tapas.io/t/selling-free-comic-reviews-closed/36788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","[""I reviewed the prologue of your novel! One of the things I like is how you describe certain objects. Like you don't describe them with flattering, beautiful words but with vulgar words like flesh and vomiting. That creates a certain feeling and I really respect that choice."", 'thank you very much~!', ""thank you very much! It's a bit different later on but anime is the vibe I'm going for."", ""The very first thing I noticed was that you introduce a lot of characters very quickly. In the prologue alone, you mention 16 names: Miyuki-sensei, Haniel, Dagiel, Gabriel, Uriel, Cassiel, Lucifer, Asta the Titan, Lariel, Samael, Azrael, Raziel, Azazel, the Mother, Trizael, and Salsa. I'm sure that not all these characters are important to the main story (at least not right away), so I would recommend slowing down the introductions significantly; no reader is going to remember all these people! They may eventually get to know everyone, but if the classmate isn't important after the prologue, why name them? It adds a bit of confusion.\nThe angel classification system also seems to be complicated. You use 14 different terms denoting rank: Virtue, Axia, Third Sphere, Ninth Rank, Falla, Second Sphere, Fifth Rank, Archangel, Knights, Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Power, and merangel in the prologue. There is little explanation given for them (except for Axias and merangels), and the average reader won't have any previous knowledge about angel classification. A bit of explanation here describing spheres, ranks, and classes would be beneficial.\nI do like the basis of the story, however. It seems to be interesting from the very first episode, and I would keep reading if I weren't so tired right now. Keep writing; you're very creative "", 'The mother is what they call God because god is female identified.

Malfunction (short story) | Tapas
The last time humanity will flourish before it's gone for good.


A short story I made a little while ago. 
It's weird.
And there's a bunch of little mistakes here and there..
but I still like it.





This was kind of an experimental thing i did a little while ago. Half of it is told as a picturebook and the other half is a silent comic. Id like to know as many people's thoughts on it as possible before I start doing my other, much larger stories.
More specifically, I would mostly like to know how well everything comes across. So far everyone ive showed it to has liked it for the most part and im pretty satisfied with how it turned out (even though its apparent that I rushed some parts)  but I can't really tell whether it makes sense or not to others.
Because theres a few parts that, while make sense to me, I can see being questionable to someone else.Im gonna try to avoid explaining things because I feel like if you didn't get it, it means i didn't communicate it well enough, and thats what I'm trying to improve on.
Of course you can also just tell me whether you enjoyed it or not and stuff. Any feedback is helpful ouo)~","[""It's pretty good as is! The style is consistent, it has a very obvious mood and theme it wants to communicate, and the art is really pretty. The attempt to escape the machine area seems to be the most visibly rushed part, but it's still fine. It was really enjoyable, though it's up to you to do something like this again in the future or try this style with a new project, in the end."", 'Thankyou for the response\nHaha yeah theres a lot of weird skipping in that section..I am thinking of incorporating certain elements of this into future projects', ""oh this is so cute!! Except for the part where he, ya know, killed the kid's parents, but I get that he's a robot and doesn't understand. That kind of makes it better. I love your art, the idea, and am going to keep reading!!"", ""This was a very gorgeous comic! I loved both the picture book and silent comic structure.\nThe only critique I have was concerning the text. I know that you already replied to somebody who had brought up similar sentiments in the comment section of part 7, but I think it's important to reiterate that even pictures books follow a certain format when it comes to paragraph line spacing, especially since it can impact the flow and visual storytelling of the story and artwork.\nA couple of times I found the text and pictures visually combating for attention. There just wasn't enough breathing room between some of the sections. I'd just suggest observing more picture books for reference. I'm sure, if you're ever interested in looking into it, you'd have fun with experimenting with what you can do.\nAll that being said, it didn't detract from the overall understanding of the story. I highly enjoyed reading this! I'll be looking forward to seeing how your future projects comes along!"", 'Thankyou~ glad you enjoyed it\nOkay I see what you mean. I probably should have took the scrolling into consideration on some of those pages.\nI have read alot of picturebooks although I havent seen any picturebooks in the webtoon format before. If you know any, Id like to read em.', ""I haven't seen any personally but I'm sure there are some webtoons that use that kind of format. Finding them in the sea of comics is just the hard part. If I ever come across any I'll let you know!\nIf you ever create another webtoon like this you can always just get beta readers to judge the flow of the story. I'd be happy to help and I'm sure others on the forum would be too!

428,Boba Wants to Read and Review Some Comics!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello! 
This is Boba, my Shuppet, and lately they wanted to read some new comics that don't usually pop up in the Tapas Home Page and say some nice things about them. Because Shuppets typically feed on negative stuff, I promise all we shall leave you are nice things that we really like about your comic, so we hope you can share to us what you've made with your heart.

Please link us to your comic!

Give us a short 1-2 sentence blurb about your comic. If you write it in a way an epic movie trailer narrator would read it, even better!

What Pokemon would your comic's main character would like to be with and why? What's this question for? Partly because I'd like to know what kind of Pokemon you would associate your child with, partly because Pokemon are cool.

That's it. Oh, and because this will be a casual thing and I do not have the best internet connection, I might not get through to everyone's comic that fast, especially if you have a lot of pages. Because we WILL read most, if not all of it. We're open to any sort of comic, be it long form, strips, mature content, go for it! Thank you!

Korobela (african love potion) | Tapas
'what you wish for is not what you'll get, but what you recieve will come to you doubled'

can you make some one love you using voodoo?
and are you willing to face what will come to you?
do you think forced love can ever be true?
are you running...





","[""I read the first chapter just now. Before I get to that let me point out that it is completely normal to experience a drop in numbers from chapter 1 to 2 (and even over the following ones). It's just that people might find a title or thumbnail interesting, click on the novel and read the first chapter and just notice that maybe they had different expectations and this just isn't for them. It doesn't mean the novel is bad or something is wrong with it. It's just a normal thing of people trying something and finding out it's not for them while others will try and read on.\nNow, onto the first chapter  I wouldn't say it's bad. I actually like the writing style but what I noticed was that to me, it read more like an introduction. I'm being told what this Korobela is but I don't have a story yet. (I took a glance at chapter two and that seems to start there?) I could imagine that this could be a problem because people don't know what they're getting into and what they should expect of the story overall."", ""Some sentences are too long. The last one on the first page is basically a whole paragraph. As well as the first sentence of Cleo. I just lost the narrative thread in the middle of it, like, why do I read this much description in one sentence? It just goes and goes.  I'd say you also use commas where some other punctuation marks should be, but I am not well-versed in English punctuation to point exact problems out."", ""Alright, so, I went on to read chapter 2 and 3 too since they're so short  Here's something more. By the way, I do apologize, this probably reads very confusing since I haven't ordered my sentences yet.\nI'm normally totally in favor of short chapters but these seemed very short. The first and second one especially since nothing really happened. Chapter 2 is similar to chapter 1 in how I'm being told something (there's that woman, she makes that potion, her life is like that) but I'm still a bit lost. I do see a connection between chapter 1 and 2 since both deal with the potion and after chapter 3 (just a guess), I could imagine that maybe the second woman would go and get one and then all hell would break loose.Of everything I read now, chapter 3 was the most interesting in terms of content because here, I have a character who wants something (namely that celebration with her boyfriend) and then things happen that make that unlikely so there's a bit of conflict. The latter part is also not just being told but there is something happening (contrary to chapter 1 and 2).I think that if maybe chapter 1 and 2 were combined into a slightly longer one (maybe without some details about the woman since that doesn't seem very important yet) so that the actual story can start sooner, that might help a bit.\nOne thing I had trouble with in chapter 3 was the length of the sentences. I think there were some but it felt like just one endless sentence to me. I think it would be good to shorten them into smaller parts and also have some paragraphs. It's really hard to read as it is now."", 'So I need to Fix my punctuation and reduce the run on time with the sentences I have. I can do that.thanks for the review.', 'Ow I see now, that makes sense. I can see how that can make things confusing. I did think that it might be a bit hard to follow,  my bad, so basically one of the biggest mistakes I make is sentence structure and loosing the narrative?', ""Ah, sheesh, no, I meant my comment might be confusing since I hadn't ordered my thoughts yet  The narrative was clear to me as in I knew what was happening.\nBasically, I agree with the others too about the punctuation, run-on sentences, and paragraphs. Then I also felt (I feel like @joannekwan covered that better than me) that the first two episodes were very much just me being told something while in number three something was happening so I felt it was better.My idea was to maybe combine episode 1 and 2 and take some details out that aren't important yet. The reason basically being what Joanne Kwan already said "", 'I think your premise is really interesting, and got me to read more, but your writing style was so distracting to me that I stopped a few pages later.\nI can tell you\'re overflowing with ideas, but you need to slow down. \nTake more time to proofread your story. There are a lot of grammatical issues, especially with your sentence structure. I think your biggest problem is with run-on sentences- that\'s when you string independent clauses together without a connecting word. It\'s kind of how Trump speaks, so maybe listen to his speeches to get an impression of how that kind of writing sounds to a reader. \nFor example: ""Korobela is suffering, burning in the pits of hell whilst walking on earth, it burns you more the more selfish you are, there is no escaping the consequences of you actions when it comes to korbela, not even death can save you from the physical and emotional suffering, you souls have been forcefully tied together and will remain that way for the rest of eternity""\nThis does not need to be all one sentence. Also, it\'s really repetitive. You have some good imagery, but pick and choose what you want to write and let your metaphors stand alone. You\'re like a woman thinking that the more bracelets she puts on the more beautiful she is, while in reality having one understated piece lets that piece shine. \nAlso, vary your sentence length. Put some short ones in there, let them breath. Read this thing.1\nPay attention to the words you use and make sure they\'re correct- ""it"" vs ""its,"" for example. And use capital letters when starting dialogue. Also, paragraphs. Especially on page three- no one wants to read a wall of text.\nI would edit the sentence from before like this:""Korobela is suffering. It\'s burning in the pits of hell whilst walking on earth.There is no escaping the consequences of your actions when it comes to Korbela- it burns you more the more selfish you are, and forcefully ties your souls together for the rest of eternity."" \nIn the argument on page four, I like the dialogue (I think it flows well) but your punctuation needs work. There\'re huge run on sentences in the beginning. You need to capitalize the beginning of sentences. Use ellipsis very sparingly, as they can look very juvenile. Instead, use interruption or the dialogue itself to imply pauses. Finally, don\'t put a bunch of exclamations all next to each other (""misunderstanding!!!???"")- again, it looks juvenile. Have you ever seen that kind of thing in a published novel? It really contrasts with the mature dialogue in that scene. \nA lot of people here seem to think that a good story will shine through bad art and writing. I don\'t think that\'s the case. If you don\'t write well, it doesn\'t matter how good your story is, because it\'s the telling that matters. There\'s a reason people read books instead of wikipedia summaries.

    I'm new to the webcomic scene (a few months). That said, I have seen an astonishingly vast number of people, across all webcomic forums, ask for meaningful critiques and receive few or no responses. The ratio of requests to answers is heartbreaking. Even here, which seems one of the more active forums, the Review category is comparatively tiny compared to its counterparts. Lots of people are asking, and comparatively few are answering.

432,New BL comic about war and duality of idologies,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello guys, would you mind to give a hand and help a beginer author?But only if you're trutly interested, ok? I don't want to bother you. 
READ HERE17
SINOPSIS:This is a mini serie of comic strips telling the story of Elih, a pacifist boy who was oblied to enroll the magic army. Where he met a man called Vax, known by everyone as ""The Deadly admiral"". Vax is a psychopath who entered the army when a young man, to be able to commit murder without being hunted by the justice.
This duality of ideologies will change Elih's world brutally.
The comic's cover is inspired by the Ying Yang symbol, to represent the duality of both main characters. The interest between them is a thing, but there's a psicological plot happening in the background, because I believe romance for romance feels empty and fake. the characters will pass through mental dilemmas that will challenge their believes. 
Note: English isn't my main language, therefore, please be understanding to possible mistakes. Thank you and have fun :3

It's a story about a serial romantic falling in love with a guy who is just the opposite. The format is short, daily chapters, and it is ongoing. I will warn you though. I'm writing in the very controversial first-person perspective. Shocking, right?  So, if you don't mind it, please read.
Also, I started this series to improve my writing and commitment to storytelling, and I know reviews will help me do that. So, I ask you to read the story so far and point out any flaws in the grammar, plot elements, pacing, character development, and even the tags, description, and visuals. Any reviews, even the flames, are appreciated.
Thanks so much!

100 Words BL | Tapas
Capturing feelings in 100 words a day. A story about encounters, love, and the aches and pains of life. 
TRIGGER WARNING: Chapters labeled [TW] may contain situations that are upsetting to some readers.





","[""I've read what you have so far, and I have a few thoughts for you!\nI'm actually working on a similar project of 100-word drabbles (and I'm very familiar with drabbles in general) so I know a little of how difficult the process can be.\nI think your exposition is really well done, and I find that Desmond's moments when he recalls his past relationships are clear. It reminds me a little of the writing from The Hazel Wood, detailed but allowing the reader to fill in the gaps themselves, which I'm fond of.\nI do think your flow is a little stilted, at present. The structure of the chapters without dialogue are pretty much all single paragraphs, which can be visually challenging to read. It might be a good practice to have paragraphs that are only a few sentences, so you can break them up with blank lines between to improve the visual. In addition, many of the sentences were around the same length, which made the pacing a little monotone. Try experimenting with emdashes, semicolons, italics, single-word paragraphs, etc to keep the eye dancing across the screen/page.\nFlow and pacing aside, I didn't notice any technical issues. While I'm personally never fond of first-person (but I wouldn't say on Tapas it's controversial, as the majority of novels here tend to favor that POV), I do think you're pulled it off very well. I'm already invested in Desmond's journey for love! His friends sound super cool, his exes not so much, and I'm uncertain how I feel about Charles thus far. I'm so nervous that he's falling in love with a guy who just wants someone to keep him warm for a night haha but it's a great premise!\nTL;DR break up sentence and paragraph length, experiment with other forms of punctuation, keep your exposition and description as flawless as it already is. Very promising work, here!"", ""Hello!I agree with Pan's advice.I like your premise and writing style, I haven't seen many short format types before. It's interesting since it's seems to take inspiration for how poetry likes to set up it's ideas.\nFirst-person perspective is controversial? I haven't heard that before. What are the reasons for that?"", ""@Pan Ahhh!  Thanks so much for such a detailed response! It's way more than I thought I was going to get, so I really appreciate it. I'm going to try breaking up the paragraph in the next chapter, and switching up my sentence structure. Pacing is difficult for me so these tips really help.\n@An_Alias Thanks for reading! I was actually super into poetry before I ventured into long form storytelling, so it's a huge influence. As for the first-person thing, I've posted first-person content on Ao3, and FanFic before, and it didn't go well. There were some really bad comments, and I wasn't as confident in receiving criticism at the time, so I took it all down. Maybe it's just my experience though. I'm glad I seem to be pulling it off this time around! "", ""Huh. I think the perspective is a personal preference. Personally I find it hard to empathize with characters in third person, and you're coming at this from a more personal/emotional angle, so don't stress about it too much!

","[""Unfortunately I don't have time to sit down and read it all today, but I went through some pages to see about the first impressions. Your use of color is great and the lettering is readable and nice, but maybe it's not catching on because the expressions are a little lacking? Your character designs are dynamic but if the reader doesn't see much aside from slight eyebrow/mouth movement and very little body language, they could have a hard time identifying with the characters and sticking around.\nThis is just a really quick glance though, someone else with more comic experience could probably give better advice."", ""Thank you for that, did you start at the beginning or pick up at a random spot?  I'm hoping to improve on this exact thing in the current chapter."", 'Hi, here is my opinion, I hope I can help a little, I don\'t represent the whole audience so take this with a grain of salt. \nI read your comic though my mobile and I am a user with tired sight. \nMy first impression is that the style is very unique, the backgrounds are gorgeous and you really invest time in coloring and planning beautiful scenes. I like the corporal language of the characters and how they emote. \nIf I had to point out what I think can be improved is that I think each page is very monotone. There are too many panels and none of them stand out. Don\'t get me wrong they are beautiful, and this is only an ""issue"" when you read it on the mobile. (If this was a printed comic it would be fine) You scroll down and there too many dialogues, and many panels that look the same and casual readers might expect something that catches their eye. \nMaybe have fewer panels, but more variety in the camera angles, close-ups to emphasize an emotion. Most panels look as if we were looking at them from afar As I mentioned at times there are too many dialogues and on my mobile, they look very tiny to read comfortably, this might not be a problem for readers with bigger phones or better sight XD  But also, let\'s be real many users are too lazy to read the whole thing. \nIn my opinion, the ""problem"" is not the story, you could take better advantage of the format to make your work look more appealing.Webcomics have a different rhythm and formats than book comics...it took me a reboot of my series to understand that.  \nKeep up the good work! I hope you find some utility in this thread.', ""Very insightful, thank you! I will take that into consideration. I think I kind of approach my panels like storyboards, trying to show the rhythm of how a scene would play out, maybe that's been a mistake. I'll try to approach new pages with your feedback in mind thank you."", ""Oh, also I'm going to start posting them as a stack of panels rather than as a page. I was just talking to my co-author about this and we think it'll make everything much easier to read."", ""I think your art is quite good and pretty darn cute! You have a lot of talent. A few tweaks might make your work resonate more.\nHere's my four cents.\n1) You might want to go with a more mobile friendly format, so that the font is bigger. Also, you use a lot of words and some (not all) of the panels feel a bit crammed.\n2) I like your art, but think you might benefit from a crisper line, more contrast, and colors that popped more. Your panels tend to feel on the dark and muddy side. I like dark and muddy, but for your type of story cleaner would work best.\n3) You can draw and compose, however, a lot of panels lack depth because the foreground tends to merge with the background. I think you need to vary your line and tonal values to better separate foreground from middle and background. \n4) Most of the stuff on Tapas feels like parts of a graphic novel; your comic feels almost like a daily strip. Embrace the compositional possibilities that the web allows for. Blow everything up and go dramatic!\nHope this helps! Good luck."", ""I picked around the last 10 pages and went through them as if I found them on Fresh, to see the most recent art.I also like A4 comic way more than vertical scroll, which is why I didn't point it out like the other users, but font size is a thing to keep in mind for mobile users - even if it's readable on both mobile and desktop, a distinct border around the bubbles can go a long way."", 'I\'ve never hard the term ""A4"" but I prefer to read pages than individual panels as well.

Leaving The Cradle | Tapas
Because one error, humans are now standing on the verge of an alien contact. 
A meld of hard SF and space opera genres.





Genre and tone Science fiction, serious but not epic... Maybe with occasional funny moment here and there.Summary of the plot up to nowAn alien exploratory fleet arrives in solar system, discovers humans and decides to check us out. Accidentally they underestimate our tech levels, which leads to their shuttle being shot down by our military. Sole survivor is then being found by a gang of humans that camped in the woods where and when the craft fell.Thing I'd like to be criticizedWell, I already know that I'm horrible at drawing faces and I'm already trying to improve at that, but additional helping kick is always welcome. Feel free to draw over my art if you think that'll make your point across better! I also worry about my pacing - sometimes I feel like I rush things too fast. 
But in general be merciless to EVERYTHING, it is my first and quite possibly the only comic project, so I want to do it as best as I can.I'm not native English speaker; Volunteer proofreader begun checking texts after page 12.","[""Ok. There are several things which have seem weird to me.1. How aliens could underestimate humans so much that they didn't know about Anti-aircraft warfare systems? What did they investigated during the whole month from the orbit if not the possible dangers? Also, why with such a level of technical development they haven't protect their shuttle? I can't say this all is theoretically impossible, but just weird for me.2. Why does their shuttle look so alike to humans shuttle? Probably with more high technologies and materials they could come up to more effective flier. Again, it is not impossible, just questionable.3. Lifespan of one of the races is noted as 1±∞ seconds. But how a negative lifespan of 1-∞ = -∞ seconds is possible? Can they move backward in time or something?\nWell, at this point my criticism have dried up. Overall, your comics look good and interesting. I like the aliens designs and their main ship and interested in which direction will story lead.It seems like you draw it slowly because every panel is made very neatly and diligently. So you could think about changing something to speed up the process of drawing. Maybe omit some of details, or something. But it also can be left as is, and it will be good too.\nGood luck with your comics!"", ""Hello, thanks for the criticism! I'll comment on the points you had mentioned.\n\n\ntired_programmer:\nHow aliens could underestimate humans so much that they didn't know about Anti-aircraft warfare systems? What did they investigated during the whole month from the orbit if not the possible dangers? Also, why with such a level of technical development they haven't protect their shuttle? I can't say this all is theoretically impossible, but just weird for me.\nYes, It got me to that relatively recently that it was indeed weird. I decided to shuffle around some ideas in the comic and change the plot a bit, so story now have some justification to it, stemming from characters actions, that will be revealed a bit further in the plot... Although I'm not sure if it will add plausibility to the situation or will subtract from it even further. X)\n\n\ntired_programmer:\nWhy does their shuttle look so alike to humans shuttle? Probably with more high technologies and materials they could come up to more effective flier. Again, it is not impossible, just questionable.\nWell, Buran was pretty much identical to Space Shuttle too. Laws of physics don't particularly care what planet are you from, so they dictate shape of an object that wants to enter atmosphere and remain in one piece. So I rolled with that, partially because of the aforementioned logic behind the shape, and partially because of my anger about end of the space shuttle program and labeling it a mistake.Plus, strictly speaking, it is already more effective than human one, since it can accelerate from Jupiter to Earth and back without refueling, and have VTOL and SSTO capabilities.\n\n\ntired_programmer:\nLifespan of one of the species is noted as 1±∞ seconds. But how a negative lifespan of 1-∞ = -∞ seconds is possible? Can they move backward in time or something?\nI was using statistical meaning of the symbol, not mathematical one, I think? Meaning that maximum lifespan of Azinarsi can be anything between infinitely short and infinitely long, since they're digital.\n\n\ntired_programmer:\nIt seems like you draw it slowly because every panel is made very neatly and diligently. So you could think about changing something to speed up the process of drawing\nWell, in fact, the longest phase of the drawing is the initial rough sketching, actually. I usually can do line and coloring in two days or less (all hail LazyNezumi Pro, our lord and savior!), so economy there wont achieve any significant reduce of the speed at which I'm making the pages, but it will definitely affect the quality."", ""I went in to crit your faces since you said you were horrible at them and was pleasantly surprised- you're definitely not horrible at faces! There's one thing I think that's holding them back and that's the structure and expression in the eyes. You're drawing them a lot more like eye-symbols than eyes which can make the side views look a bit off.

Anything can help, and if you like please don't hesitate to subscribe!","['first impression by reading summary: summary too long.. too detailed. I\'d rather just find out as I read\nsecond impression: holy wtf the art??? it\'s absolutely not to my standard to stay.\nThe actual criticism: You know, if that ""loses his dad to the battle cause and he believes vengeance is the answer"" was illustrated as a short prologue chapter, it would have been nicer than explaining it all in the summary because then I wouldn\'t feel like you\'re treating me like.... a primary school reader.\nFinal thoughts: This is way too rough. I normally would only pick at things that are easily fixed up within a week or so to improve readability or attractiveness, but this has too many rough edges in terms of presentation. The writing itself needs work. The art has a chance to improve, but the way the story is introduced needs to be much clearer.', 'Thanks for your constructive criticism Will take it all into consideration.', 'On the cover page the art is blurry for some reason. I don\'t know if this is a problem with the way you saved the file, or the way you drew the art, but since some of the art in comic is crisper, you might want to assess whats happening there- this is the first impression of your comic! The image quality should be some of the best!\nIn chapter one I notice a lot of areas where the blood has jagged edges to the lines. I suggest drawing it in a way closer to your line art as it\'s aesthetically jarring compared to the soft lines everywhere else.\nMaybe it works better on a phone, but on my computer screen the second text box, ""Bloodthirsty"" is cut off, so the section reads:\n\nThey had no weaknesses and they were,\nThousands of years ago, our forefathers,\nwere able to cage up the kind and Queen of these Afreets.\n\nAnd only AFTER do scroll down and see the ""blood thirsty"". Essentially whats happening is the text boxes are not flowing naturally, and it\'s confusing to read. I know technically you\'re right because these boxes are in the same panel, but the panel is so long that I don\'t see the second box and my eye is draw sideways. If you have two bright yellow dialogue boxes side by side, that\'s where the eye will be tugged.\nHowever the art in this section is the nicest in the chapter, in my opinion. It has the most mood and the demon feels intimidatig.

439,Looking for Proofreading help (trading for art?),Reviews | Feedback,[],"Putting this on Reviews since I'm not sure it's exactly for collaboration.
Hello! I'm doing my first long form webcomic project here on Tapas, Splitting Image. However, I'm having a bit of trouble with the starting script past the prologue, and with some advice from other users, I'm here to ask for a proofreader to see the script on the first two chapters of it! It's not prose or anything, but I'd like advice to know if the pacing is appropriate and if there are any big problems I need to fix before I go on with this.
edit: for clarification, I actually have my script done-ish for several chapters already, it's just Chapter 1 and 2 that are really making me unsure now that I wrote the rest.
Unfortunately, money is tight so I wouldn't be able to pay, but I can make a trade with art! I do illustrations and my specialty is fantasy art and character design, and since a lot of people here work on novels and comics, maybe I can give some (simple) fanart in return? Here's a few examples of my work below.

Boil Frogs Slowly | Tapas
Guys being dudes and making bad decisions.







You don't have to read the whole thing! If you only read the first couple paragraphs and leave a review I still appreciate it!
What I'm mainly trying to work on are the scene and character descriptions. I can't picture things in my head, so writing a scene and having it translate correctly to the reader can be a challenge. That being said, I welcome reviews on all other aspects of it too!

Feel free to be brutally honest! I really want to improve my writing.
Leaving your review in the comments is preferred, but a PM or here works fine too!


Plot Summary: The story is about a boy (Jack) getting pushed into a relationship. That relationship turns out to be manipulative and dangerous. His partner isn't exactly who people think he is. When it becomes clear there is an active serial killer in their town, Jack can't help but become suspicious.","['Hey! I really like what I’ve read. I like the content since I’m a sucker for “darker” storylines.If I could give any advice, it’d be to find ways to maybe make your sentences longer or flow together a little more. It seems like you have a lot of short sentences which can make parts feel a bit abrupt/choppy. I sort of have the opposite problem where I go back and try to break senteces up .But I definitely like what you’re working with. Thanks for sharing and welcome to the forums!', 'Thank you! I will keep an eye on my sentence structure and keep that in mind when I go back to edit!', ""Before I jump in, I noticed you gave us a great summary of what was to come, but you only have 'Guys being dudes and making bad decisions.' I tend to read the summaries to see if they interest me, and if I saw the one you have for your novel description, I wouldn't read it. However, the one you gave us in your post gets me interested in what will come of his relationship. I highly recommend using the forum summary for your story's actual summary.\nEdit: @An_Alias  I noticed you have two characters' actions in one paragraph a lot. Here's a link1 on when it's best to paragraph. Keep in mind you don't have to follow these rules to the letter, but there are some more common ones that make it easier for readers to understand what's going on."", 'I agree! Thank you! I kind of forgot what I had put there ', 'Hey-o! I read a bit and I\'d love to give you a little critique as requested ^^ Gotta say, I\'m really glad you\'re looking to improve your writing! Being open to honest feedback and not taking offense to it is a huge step, and one I had trouble accepting when I first started writing XD Good on you! Anyway, on to my review!\nI noticed right away that you\'ve got pretty good chops for interesting writing. What you have is compelling enough to keep a person reading, and it\'s got a decent, unique voice. I\'ll get to the parts you specifically requested critique on in a bit, but first, a few technical aspects to go over.\nDialogue Tags are the ""he snapped"" and ""she gasped"" after a direct character quote. Your novel is in first-person, past tense, which creates quite a few ""I said""\'s. If you\'re going to include a dialogue tag spoken in a neutural tone, make sure to end your quote with a comma instead of a full stop. For example:\n""Stop that,"" I said.\nIf you have a full stop at the end of dialogue, followed by a tag, it can really break up the flow and make the text more difficult to easily read. Another thing I saw is you have a lot of dialogue tags. A good rule of thumb is, if it\'s obvious who is speaking, leave the tag out. So our above sentence becomes simply\n""Stop that.""\nIt\'s also a bit more powerful! ""Said"" is an invisible word, so most of us tend to read over it without much fuss, but every now and then your characters will need a different tone of voice. If you want to emphasize the way a character delivers their dialogue, then it\'s acceptable to add a more colorful word than ""said"". Still, if you can do without the tag, remove it!\nHere\'s another technical thing that will help with readability: If you have a large paragraph that goes over more than one subject, split it up. In the paragraph where we see Chris\'s description, Chris says something, then our main boy dumps into description as the narrator, then Chris says something else. You can split that paragraph into three pieces to keep your reader\'s eyes scanning the page. I\'ll place the paragraph below for reference, changed with the basic structural edits I would suggest if I was being paid to edit lol:\n\n""That\'s my fault,"" Chris said, yawning.\nHe had about an inch of hair, from what I could tell, though his eyebrows were MIA. Dark circles stained under his eyes. He\'d always been sick, but it never felt right to ask.\n""You got suspended? Didn\'t you just transfer to our school?""\n\nThat\'ll help a lot with flow! Paragraphs that are too short in clumps are obviously no bueno, and you have a decent balance and understanding of general structure already, so you\'re ahead on that one.\nNow! For what you asked for lol I\'ll focus on description in general, rather than specifically character description (because I firmly believe they should be structured the same way). I\'ll use the above description of Chris for example. It\'s a very decent description already. I especially like how mentioning the dark circles under his eyes and him being sick often tie in together. For the less-observant reader, that tells us his health is causing sleeping issues, which is GOOD DAMN BUILDUP, LEMME TELL YOU\nahem\nThis kind of description is rich and detailed, but also static; the story stops for a moment so we can get the details. This is totally fine, but if done too often, can take the reader out of the text and remind them they\'re reading. The goal for all authors is to produce a product that consumers can lose themselves in. (I do static description myself all the time, and I\'m still working on making it flow better. This is a more advanced tip that a lot of very experienced writers haven\'t mastered, so feel free to set it aside and continue doing the already-wonderful descriptions you\'re doing!)\nA good way to get around stopping the story is to describe your location/person/item as the story continues, never stopping the action. I\'ll provide a before and after example of my own writing for context, so you can get an idea of what I mean.\n\nBefore\nThe man that gets out is slender, with brown skin, long, lean arms, a wide, toothy grin, and cleanly combed hair. It’s dyed the color of autumn leaves, and hangs around his chin. It’s early for winter wear, but the driver loops a multi-colored knit scarf around his neck as he shuts the door, covering all of his skin.\nAfter\nA man exits the car--though he\'s slender enough to fit through the window--with a wide, toothy grin tugging his cheeks as he smiles at Art. Even though it\'s too early for winter wear, the man loops a multi-colored knit scarf around his neck as he shuts the door, covering every inch of his brown skin. The breeze catches his hair, dyed the color of autumn leaves, and by the time he reaches Art, the ends have settled by his chin.\n\nIn the first example, we get a rich description, but the story stops for the narrator to tell it. In the second, we get a description that happens while the narrator notices it. It\'s the difference the narrator seeing aspects because of action, as opposed to stopping to look for a while.\nOF NOTE, this kind of stuff I only ever notice and edit after my first draft. It\'s totally fine to write basically whatever comes to you, and to edit later. Not a single writer I\'ve met in my life can do this on the fist try haha. I wrote an entire 80k word book and then spent like, two months doing nothing but editing it. Editing is where the magic happens!\nWOW I DIDN\'T MEAN TO WRITE THIS MUCH I SWEAR LMAO\nI\'m really passionate about helping people develop their writing skills, and I want to reiterate how impressive it is that you already have a voice of your own in your text. Voice is something everyone talks about, and it can be developed, but some people already have it. And you, friend, already have it!\nMy final advice is to just pay attention to technical grammar/punctuation stuffs, but otherwise keep doing what you\'re doing! It\'s an impressive beginning and you\'ve gained an eager subscriber. I hope this helps you further your goal of improving!\n(Forgot to say this earlier: I really love the title, it\'s so foreboding and cool lol okay byeee)', ""Thank you so much! I want to let you know how much I appreciate all of your advise! I'm a little overwhelmed by it right now \nSeeing it explained makes it easier for me to know how to improve! I'll defiantly be editing the whole thing pretty roughly  "", ""I KNOW I'M SORRY IT WAS A LOT\nIt takes time to develop a style that works for you! I've been seriously writing for maybe ten years and I think I'll always be chasing improvement. The only way to go is up!"", 'Also! Don’t let editing stop you too long from writing more. I know I need to clean up a ton of grammar in my novel... but for now I have a flow with my story that I’m not trying to break. When I get downtime I’ll work on fixing grammar in my past chapters.So keep it up!', ""It's good!! I was worried I wouldn't get much advise, so I'm in a state of shock in general lol"", ""Got it! \nI might keep writing to get to my first major plot point before I go back to fix things. It's not far off from it rn"", ""If you ever want more pointers, I'm a bank of writing knowledge useless in the real world :' D"", 'Will do! Definitely let me know if anything else come to mind as well!', ""The summary hooked me tbh, and I'd orefer seeing that than what you have now ngl"", 'I did change the summary on the novel, but it looks like the forums are slow to update ', ""The reason for that is once a link is dropped, it remains that way forever. If you want the summary of the link you provided to match the one you changed it you, you have to edit your original post, delete the link, and put it down again XD Tedious, I know, but that's the way it be"", ""Oof, okThe UI doesn't seem to like me right now so I'll try that again in a bit"", 'Really enjoyes your work. The pace is smooth, the writing style is well nice to read and original. I would try to spaceout the layers of the story just a litle bit more. Other wise,it was a pleasure to read it.', ""Thank you!ok! One of my problems trying to writing it last time was I had too much non-plot stuff going on and the plot got lost, so I was trying to cut the fat. I may have over compensated  I will watch that!

i feel like it was hard to find an audience this comic since it falls somewhere between porn and experimental art. i think readers that were looking for porn got bored with it, but readers that would otherwise like it's experimental or romance themes were immediately put off by all the nudity. anyways, i'd love to hear what you think if you have any thoughts...

I\'ve just finished to read the ""First date"" and the ""Second date"", so I can share some thoughts, which I had when reading it.\nFirst of all, I was curious, why did they swim among the ice (according to the first pannel of the first issue)? Weren\'t they cold? But I didn\'t see any answer to it. I was also surprised, when the dark-haired girl seated on the wave, but then I\'ve understood that it\'s kind of joke. ¯_(ツ)_/¯Second, it was weird (espeically at the beginning) to see the cartoonish art on the photographic background. I wanted to ask, did you consider adding filters to those photos, to make them more consistent with the foreground objects? However, after some time of reading, I\'ve somehow accustomed to it and started to think that maybe it\'s just a legit part of the style. By the way, I liked the water reflections at the ""Third date"" series of issues.Third, your comics is funny at some moments, but at another moments I just didn\'t get the jokes and why do they do what they do, so my attention flew away. ¯_(ツ)_/¯\nIn general... I think, that it can find its audience (however, probably not so big, as more usual slice-of-life things). I myself is more into plot-driven comics, but many other people like to read short cute slice-of-life stories about the couples, and your comics has its own unique style and some weird charm, which makes it stand out from the rest of the comics of this type. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nGood luck!', 'That was a really sweet story aww!! I love how you’ve written the characters, they’re so full of personality and charm :DDD hopefully you’ll write more of these fluff-ish stories, they’re really fun to read ^_^', 'wow, thanks so much for your thoughts and taking the time to write up your response, i really appreciate it! \nyeah, i admit there was a lot perplexing attributes in the narrative and art. i supposed i am being a bit indulgent with my experimentation... i mostly wanted to see where it would go.\ni did enjoy only using photographic backgrounds, i was just being lazy at first, but it was really fun to try to compose them into the frame, and after i while i got a bit better at it and i did use filters to merge the characters with the colors in the background, or more often bring the background up to support them.\nanyways, knowing well that there are aspects that are a bit eccentric and hard to follow, i really appreciate the feedback as i am really curious as to what impression my experimentation is making on the reader.\nthanks so much!S<|', ""thank you so much! i really appreciate it, and hope to write more about them soon, next time with a more flushed out story! i'm glad you enjoyed and the eroticism didn't distract from their personalities and the dynamic of their relationship.\nthanks!S""]",6/9/2019 14:55,https://forums.tapas.io/t/just-finished-wlw-comic-sleepy-giantess-good-morning-would-love-your-feedback/34356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
443,Which perspective drawing is correct? Need help,Reviews | Feedback,[],"My skills in perspective drawing are not so great. Sometimes, I'll get it, but later I'll get confused all over again.So, here are two images of a school with a bench near a vending machine, assuming they are both perfectly parallel to the sidewalk:

Is the general image of the scene in one-point perspective or two-point perspective? I feel like the background is in one-point perspective but the bench and the vending machine are trying to trick me.
Are the sides of the bench supposed to be parallel like in the first image, or are the sides supposed to converge into a vanishing point somewhere like in the second image? If so, is the vanishing point I drew in the image a good estimate of where it should be?
Is the vending machine supposed to connect to that LEFT vanishing point I have in the image?? Or does the vending machine have its own vanishing point somewhere?? (I already have the right side of the vending machine connected to the right vanishing point.)

In normal 2-point perspective both vanishing points are on the horizon line, so the one in the second image isn't placed well. \nAll lines that are parallel in 3-D space will converge to the same vanishing point.

","['Hello! I read through your comic, I\'m not really the best at reviews, but here\'s what I can say;\nWhat I love about your comic is, for one, your logo! It\'s very eye-catching and well designed! I also really like the flow of the comic it\'s fairly easy to read and the comedic aspect is also very amusing, It\'s a very strong start, those aren\'t really that easy to make, but you pulled it off! \nWhat I think you could fix, is mostly the colours, maybe look into colour theory a bit to see what goes together? Try not to use extremely saturated colours. Also maybe work a bit on the anatomy of your characters, try to make your characters have a less ""stiff"" pose, and go for more natural & fluid ones! ^ ^\nThis is my comic;\n\ntapas.io5\n\n\n\nSurvivors: The Fallen Kingdom :: Prologue  | Tapas\nSeries will be updated once a week, I hope.

', 'Hi There,\nI also like your logo - especially how you made the B look like it was a flag. That was very creative. I also like how you went away from the stereotypical black text in a white speech bubble. As well as using the white outlines in the prologue. \nI think you can work on proportion/ anatomy. Have you tried life drawing/ cafe sketching?

I am still indeed working on colors. I do stay away from extremely saturated color (except for the red xP) still learning what colors work well together and so on! I do try different poses, but I do have to work on the clothes flow to go with the poses. Now for your review!\n-Story-\nI like from the start that instead of the usual 'Elements' it has something different in terms of the magic. It gives it a different take as once will expect something different than the usual 'fire vs water' kind of battles. The prologue seems interesting, has a bit of greek feeling to it (Trojan War) and the power of Telum seems rather interesting.\nThe comic is just starting so can't give more about the story, but what you have planted as the hook is intriguing. The main character's personality traits are well establish from the first pages too!\n-Art-\nI feel a nice mix of two styles (western and japaness) it does lean more toward the mange style, but there are still influences of other style and mix in a good way. I like your color choices and good in not using fully black as it allows for nice depth for shadows and highlights. The soft shadow effect works really well and you make sure to use 'hard shadows' for parts that would never cast soft shadow. \nOne thing is the teacher itself look the same as another student (doesn't look adult). Try incorporating elements that would make character look adult to maybe distinguish ages and so on.\n-Misc-\nI like your font quite a bit, is easy to read and you space out the bubbles well. Enough to be able to follow them easily and know how the conversation is flowing. Not a big fan on the glow effect being white on white text, if using that effect in future try making the glow more blueish to create a bit of contrast.\nOverall I like your comic, easy to read, has interesting hook and nice art. I am assuming battles will be involve so can't way to see the action scene!"", ""I'll give it a shoot once I'm free, right now I'm working on an animation, here's ma thing\na comic about police officers, Comedy/action is the name of the game.\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nUNDERCOPPER | Tapas\nPiloud city: probably the most dangerous city of the country known as Vecaduzla. but this city has something other cities doesn't, numbnuts without self preservation instinct as cops.

Most of my time drawing is doing the comic so not been able to do much drawing to develop my skills ;_;\nI actually been reading your comic already in webtoon! Found it about a week ago! Here is my review:\n-Story-\nI checked out your comic mostly cause the art was catchy, the story element on the start are a bit slow which is understandable giving is the start and is a bit of a setup for the character and their traits, yet it lacks a big hook outside the image of her fighting a dragon. I think during the 'unlucky' part of the rain it be nice if say she goes take shelter for a bit from the rain in a bus stop or something and there she sees the 'book' not wanting it to get damage she takes it with her. That would make the unlucky part something to do with the story itself as right now it feels a but like padding.\nOutside of that once she is transported I feel in love with the world and the character you introduce (love the web dweller!). I like the mystery of why she got there to early and of course the moment she was actually suppose to arrive. Your method of slowly introducing the lore and world is nice pace, not a bombardment of info, just slowly and naturally reveal.\n-Art-\nAs mention, I was drawing by the art. The chalk like line and the colorful elements was a nice change of pace. It has a storybook quality to it that looks nice and distintive! \nI would say sometime the proportion seem weird in some angles from time to time (based on the proportion use on the comic that is).\n-Misc-\nReally liking the flow of the panels and the lack of borders goes really well. Text is easy to ready (even in mobile) which is a huge plus!\nSeen as you had me hook even before asking for review I really like your comic overall and can't wait to see her become the slayer she is bound to be!"", 'Thank you for your review! That is very cool to hear that you were already reading it \nThe first chapter was a big struggle for me and I do acknowledge that I could make some changes to make the pacing smoother, so thank you for your input there - I will take it under consideration. Thank you soo much I am glad to hear that the lore is interesting and I am not bombarding the reader with too much!\nThats true about the proportions! I am trying to work on my skills - especially with perspective. So I will definitely keep on that! I am glad the style is coming across as intended. \nThank you for commenting on the text - I knew it was a risk using my own writing instead of a font, but I am glad that it is legible even on mobile.

He...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'Cause a promise is a debt\nConcerning to Artstyle:\nYou\'ve got nice ideas for composition, but still lacking some skills. I can tell that your biggest references are anime/manga, that\'s good. What you should do is to practice anatomy and drawing overall. I can tell that You\'re aiming to create some atmosphere with the backgrounds but the characters needs some work. My advice here is to warm up every time before starting to draw, 10 minutes only, you can practice gesture drawings in those 10 minutes or copy a drawing from an artist you really like and try to decipher their method. It is important to study anatomy for artist but if you don\'t have fun doing it there\'s no point on doing it.\nAlso would be nice adding contrast in the linework, heavier lines for the objects on the foreground and thiner lines for the background elements.\nLastly, try to define different expressions for every main character, this will give them some depth and help the reader to easily spot them. \nConcerning to Story telling:\nIt\'s very nice, at the begining gives some airs of epicness to end up being really funny with that prologue, it certainly seems as your goal; ""being funny"". You got some quirks here and there that achieve this. What I feel you\'re lacking is character development, try to show a little bit more of their personalities but with little as possible, focus the invisible camera for a little bit more of time so we can get to know them better. \nNote:\nBe careful with text, don\'t add too much text in a single text globe or in a panel, this can be overwhelming for the reader.\nAlso I\'m attaching some tutorials taking in consideration other reviews you got \nUnderstanding color: \nUnderstanding Color\nGesture Drawing:\nHow to Draw Gesture', 'Wow, thanks for review and links  I am checking your comic to review I thought I could had it done by tonight but yours is a bit longer than when I last saw it so taking a bit more to check everything and do a good analysis for review.

It's comedic and enjoyable! Although you can improve on the anatomy and poses of the characters, try to make more dynamic and fluid poses (Well, atleast I attempted to on mine), it will make it less stiff! The colours are debatable, some people want less saturation, but in my opinion, the saturation fits the style and theme of your comic (although it is just my opinion and many might disagree)"", ""Hey hey! I think I've seen you around SJ? Your names deffo familiar! Anyway, since I've got a bit of time on my hands, here's a review-for-a-review? \nArt StyleYou definitely have a good foundation in art and it shows, but I think you may need to brush up on your anatomy and color theory! There's plenty you can pick up with life drawing classes, of course, but if you're struggling with poses or even references from different angles, you can also try 3D modelling programs like DesignDoll or EZ Poser.\nYou've definitely got an eye for composition though, and there are places (especially at the beginning where we're introduced to the lore) where your skills shine. Keep it up!\nPacing and Storyline Not a lot of comics start out with humor and zaniness from the get go, but I like that you started yours this way (even parodying epic shows) and that you never let up on the weirdness and comedy. I do think you need to slow down a little bit because I feel like we're going at a break-neck speed.\nThere's not a lot of time spent getting to know the characters beforehand, so we're moving from one scene to the next without really knowing the characters or location. \nI think to fix this, slow down your story, especially at the beginning, as we're trying to get our bearings so to speak.\nHope that was alright ^^ \nMy comic is here, looking forward to your review!:\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nAnfange | Tapas\nWhy did her parents send her to this school?

Love the banter between the character and the dialogue keeps thing funny and interesting! Glad it starts out right in the action, grabbing ones interested from the start. Seeing as it rarely takes itself serious I don't think any mega character development is that needed at the moment. In the future is probably needed to flesh them out a bit more, but for now is easy to know the character and their personality.\nReally glad female cop are just as crazy and interesting! Whoever plays initial D is bound to drift even if they are riding a bike! (Next they need to play Forever Young!).\nThere is no much  more to say as there hasn't been a long or deeper story at the moment outside of the two 'crime' moments. Be interesting to see past relationship between all the cops, rookie years, etc, etc.\n-Art-\nThe art compliments the story quite well, it also gives a vibe of 70/80 astethic (the world that is, the art ir more modern style). I notice car seem to be quite important (at least so far) but at times they look a bit like boxes, I think added a bit of curves to the line art in the car will make them look more pleasing. I am sure by now you probably read all of Initial D so maybe try re-creating some of their car races as practice (if you aren't doing that already). \nI like the various tricks you use to give the sense of speed to the chases, great use of speedlines without being overpowering. Beside those I would try incorporating some tone details (dots, lines, etc) for better contrast in certain parts.\n-Misc-\nNot much to say here, I like the one page format and your text is easy to read. I like the flow of the panels as it feels natural!"", ""Your comic's art style is fun and colorful. I would suggest using software to add outlines, textures or shadows to your sound effect text. Or maybe buy alternate fonts online.\nAs others have said, use 3-D posing to reference anatomy.

The lines can make far-out scenes look a little flat, but having characters closer in the scene with thicker lines and characters farther away with thinner lines help to break up the flat look.\nI'm probably the last person to critique a comic, to be honest  but I've been looking for some more critiques on my comic Maximum Chaos.

Not sure what people are refereing to exactly. Is it the proportion of the character, their head/face. I haven't done shirtless yet so muscle can't be ;_; I am honestly a bit confuse on what to improve in that regard.\nNow for the main curse, the review! \n-Story-\nI like the start making it a nightmare sequence (a classic, but still works great) as it already foreshadows the dangers that will clearly hunt them. After that it slows down giving a good glimpse at school life a bit and nice use of intense moment causing flashbacks at first, but then they seem at any moment a flashback or visions can be seen. The story just started so there isn't that much to go with, but the fundamentals of it are being planted nicely and the story seem interesting.\n-Art-\nYou  have really clean outline and great use of various thickness sizes making details stand out quite nicely. Love the colors, the stand out without being overpowering, specially the haze like look you give in flashback, dreams or vision. It makes it easy to follow what is going on during moments where present and visions intertwine together. \nI would say the backgrounds perspective sometimes seem a bit weird and clash a bit with character or items. Is not often that it happens, but in some scene is noticeable (well in my case since I was analysis, I don't think most readers will notice as they don't stare at a panel for 10 minutes!). Outside of that nitpicking your art is great and it goes really well with the story!\n-Misc-\nI like your panel composition, I know you go for some claustrophobic moments sometimes and the panels help give that feeling. I do notice some chapter are longer than others and one could tell by seeing the 'page' count on the episode title, but for some it might seem they miss something when it goes from about 3 pages to suddenly one. Of course this part is hard to control but I think keeping it to one and letting the reader use to this style will work instead of the multi pages episode (mostly is to create consistency for readers expectations).\nOverall you already had me before asking for my review (was sub for awhile) so I really liked your comic. Can't wait to see why she is getting those vision and what really haunts them."", ""Thanks  I am slowly working on getting better with outline. It feels tricky to get it just right, but will indeed play with the thickness of lines.\nHere is my review!\n-Story-\nLove the premise! I like the constant use of puns from the character as if they having battles this way. The idea of language being the focus point is quite original, I did wish when they speak some words would be 'block or censor' as to drive in home the power of Babel and their influence on the way people speak. The story is just starting, but the concept and initial story elements are good.\n-Art-\nThe art is quite rough, it reminds me of the avatars popular during the use of MSN (Microsoft Messenger, RIP) in a 3D format. They seem low polygon with quite hard edges, specially in the cheek area and the joint seem to be two pieces together. There is nothing wrong with a chibi format or 3D, just feel the approach could be improve as you got quite a nice concept. If you want to continue Chibi style you can check Final Fantasy Curtain call for inspiration that has a similar feel but more modern and 2D to the style you are using now."", '@MK_Wizard @ghostieblu @danitasibert @Kaito26  I will re-review yours during the weekend since I have to check my original review and see if anything needs to be added based on your new content.']",9/24/2018 12:52,https://forums.tapas.io/t/reviews-for-your-comic/27433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
447,Hey I’ll do some comic reviews too!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Yes! I feel like critiquing some comics (only comics for now please, I'm much more used o critiquing illustrations than novels) so if you'd like a review please read ahead. I know there's a few review threads and thought I'd jump on the bandwagon.I'll only be taking 5 at a time and I'll critique them at my own pace so it might take a few weeks. If 5 people have posted before you and not been critiqued yet please wait until they have, that way you aren't waiting months for a review and I don't get overwhelmed. I'll put a list on the bottom of the post.
A few other notes- I tend to crit art using paintovers or redlines, if you don't want me to draw on your art please don't post.- If you're sensitive to critique please let me know, I don't want to upset anyone but I will be honest. - Everything is my opinion, feel free to disagree or correct me if there's something I got wrong.-I don't have time to read really long comics so crits will mostly focus on art, readability, and layout rather than themes or story telling.
OK! When you're posting please answer the following questions so I have a better idea of where you're coming from.
- Genre and tone. Genre is the category, tone is the overall feeling- so the difference between romance/drama and romance/comedy. Drama can have light moments, comedy can have serious moments but these are framed by the tone overall.)- 10-20 pages you'd like critiqued (print page size, if your comic is scrolling format ~100 panels or so. I'll read more if I can)- Summary of the plot up to that point-anything you're worried about or would like specific critique about- whether you're a native English speaker or not (this is for how much I critique the dialogue tone)

Or if you want to look at just 10 pages, the 10 newest pages please :> There was a several month gap between pages 1-8 and 9-current, so I feel that aspects of my art have come a ways since those early pages.Plot Summary: The main cast starts out in the middle of a treasure hunting mission. They defeat the monster and collect the treasure, but we see the MC choke when trying to cast his water spell. Since they live in a super dry climate, it makes it hard for him to use his water magic. When they return to the guild to collect their reward, the MC talks about his future ambitions and how he worries that he's dead weight for the team (and thus wants to improve to stop being dead weight). Then it skips to that night where we see a new character infiltrating the city and trying to pull off a heist.Specifics: Hmm, I have worries about my plot pacing xD I wrote this out to be a short story (it concludes around page 50~60) and worry that I edited it together sloppily and that the pace moves too rapidly. Art-wise I realize there's several issues that need work in the future haha. My head profiles pretty much universally look iffy, proportions are okay but need work, foreshortening is often sketchy, consistency page to page is lacking, etc. I created this mostly as a comic to learn how to comic, so I think my progress thus far has been pretty good,art-wise, but there's a long way to go still xDNative English, Y/N?

Starting a comic when you don’t have much art experience is really difficult but it’s a great way to improve quickly.I’m going to start by saying the things that I really liked, then give you a few tips and what improvements you’ve made already that made the comic a lot better.\nWhat I liked- -You’re not afraid to draw what’s in your head when it comes to action and backgrounds. You’re really good at “set dressing” which is adding details that make the world look real, road markings, cars, other people and it’s obvious you put a lot of work into this.- it was really smart to make your main character Russian too,  any grammar mistakes come across as part of the character-The first person panels are a really cool idea, keep experimenting like that, it’s what I love seeing from comics.\nImprovements you’ve already made--Changing the text from handwritten to type was a great idea, it’s a lot easier to read now and much more consistent- the backgrounds are less scribbled and more of a solid colour, the solid colour works best with your style so try to stay away from strong textures.\nThings to work on ( I did a few examples for this one so take a look at the image below)-I think your panels would look better with a strong border to contrast your thin lines and make your art stand out more. I’d also leave a gap between your panels and the edge of the page, try to line them up so one panel is close to the next one so your viewer’s eyes aren’t jumping from left to right across your canvas.-try to plan your shots to what needs to be seen. I picked out one panel in particular where 2 characters are talking but I had to read it twice before I noticed the woman in the background. Make what’s most important the most obvious, if 2 people are talking make them both obvious. It doesn’t matter how good your art is, if people get confused when they read a comic they’re a lot less likely to get invested.- your lines are very sketchy. A lot of newer artists do this because sketches tend to look better than clean lines by themselves but it adds a lot of clutter and confusion to a comic. Try to practice clean lines, which will make colouring easier and take you less time when you can do them quickly.What program are you using to draw? It seems like you’re colouring over the lines sometimes when I think you’d be better colouring under them.\nDoing anatomy and scenery studies are great for improving but that will happen over time when you continue to work on your comic so I picked out things that will make your comic easier to read right away.\nHope this helps! I was really impressed by you attention to detail, I can tell you really like working on your comic!\n\nimage.png1786x700 394 KB\n', ""Hello, I'd love to get a critique/review for my comic Maximum Chaos1\n1) Overall fantasy action-adventure with comedic qualities in through out \n2) I think my 3rd chapter is a good start for a critique and see what.\n3) its apart of the intro, but so far Marc was living his normal daily life while his runs into April (his wife) they get into the crosshair of a gang that currently robbed a bank.

I only have about 5 panels per page, so it should glide by pretty quickly. But if you have time It'd be great if you could tell me if the first chapter drags anything down storywise.  \nSummary up to that point: Frances, an aspiring jazz musician, is heartbroken when she realizes that she got put into the lowest ranking jazz combo at the university (?? music school??) she attends. \nSpecific areas I'm mainly concerned about the characterization of Frances. So far she has a clear motive (at least I hope it's clear): to become a famous musician. Her flaws are pretty obvious: she's impulsive, self-confident, insensitive, and the other characters find her annoying. I'm mainly worried that my conflict isn't clear enough or isn't strong enough. So far the conflict is introduced as Frances getting put in a terrible jazz band, but it's not very strong and doesn't allow for much character growth.. Here's what I WANT to portray:Frances quickly becomes obsessed with becoming famous after identifying her external challenges (the Leftovers band). I want to show a slow journey into madness kind of thing, where she starts taking increasingly impulsive risks so she can rise in the music industry. But I'm not sure how to do that. But in the end, what really stops her from ruining herself this way is Azzi, who Frances befriends. It's kind of a story of two outcasts finding each other in a way. Idk. I guess I just need help figuring out how to portray these things organically in my story.\nNative English speaker: yup.\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nLeftovers | Tapas\nA jazz musician with a dream to make it big finds out that she's not that great.\n\n(Don't forget to play the music if you're on desktop! :D)\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""The Librarian Arachnid Slayer\nHeya! I read the whole thing because I'm subbed on Webtoons and hadn't got round to it yet. Same as the last review I'll cover the things I like and then give you some tips to improve.\nWhat I liked-- Your story moves at a good pace, it’s clear and has defined arcs so I think you’re doing a really good job.  Your setting is obviously very fantasy inspired so things like magic and mythical creatures don’t need a lot of complicated explanation, meaning the minimal amount you have at the moment isn’t confusing. Don’t feel the need to explain any more than you have to, I’ve found that most of an audience will pick things up quickly given the right set up.- your font choice and speech bubbles are really cohesive with your art style and fit in really well with the comic-your colour palettes are really lovely and give the comic a light hearted feel, Also I’m a big sucker for textured brushes, I love your use of them throughout the comic.- your long panels give an epic feel to important scenes and they aren’t overused which really builds up the excitement for what’s going to happen next-your dialogue feels really natural\nThings to work on (again I’ll add some paint overs I did below, all of this is art because I can’t see any major story problems yet)-I get the feeling you aren’t very confident in drawing perspective. The few times the backgrounds have perspective it feels like you’ve tried to draw it in 1 point but wanted to draw it in 2 point. I overlaid a 2 point perspective grid on your marketplace scene. A few of the lines match up well but a lot of them really throw the rest off. I think doing quirky, off-perspective backgrounds can be nice but only if it’s intentionally done, learning to draw in perspective is really important for variety between panels.- Try to think about your values a bit more when you’re planning panels. Your colour choices are lovely but your value choices can make everything look a bit confusing. Try to add in atmospheric perspective where you need to.\n\nimage.png996x512 802 KB\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to change your local colours. This is especially obvious in the dark where the characters still look lit by daylight. The problem with using flat colours for everything is that you aren’t getting lighting effects from light sources which is really going to make your glowy, magic effects look really cool. I really like the flat colours so I wouldn’t add cast shadows in everywhere but I would change up your colour palettes, if you’re worried you could always save a palette of each character in different lighting conditions- night, sunrise, sunlight, indoors etc.\nyour facial anatomy could do with a bit of work. It’s difficult to critique a heavily stylised style but I think eye placement can be an issue in some of your panels, and because eye placement is off eye focus is off too. Try to practice sitting the eyes on the front of the face, I noticed quite a few times the eye was off to the side or too low. I’ve done a few edits of this and also I think darkening the top of the iris could help the focus a bit but that’s personal preference.\nimage.png1536x832 975 KB\n\n\n\nHope this helps! Sorry it always looks like I write loads of things to improve but I don’t want points to be misunderstood!"", ""@craftymarten Thank you for your in depth review! I am glad to hear that the overall pacing and style is hitting the mark \n\n\ncraftymarten:\nI get the feeling you aren’t very confident in drawing perspective\nHaha this would be an understatement! I am terrified of backgrounds and I also have a bad habit of leaving them to the last minute so they are often rushed as well. I am really trying to push myself to draw backgrounds more so I appreciate all your tips!\nI have been using the perspective tool in procreate for grids but I find I start getting to involved with the drawing and forget to check if my angles are correct...\nYou also make a good point about the values! They are something I haven't put a lot of thought into but I will strive to do this more going forward!\n\n\ncraftymarten:\nyour facial anatomy could do with a bit of work.\nI also agree!

You are able to paint your reader a scene of whats happening in a smooth way without doing an info dump. That is one of the hardest parts of writing a first chapter and you\'ve already done well. On the other hand, I have noticed three areas I think you need to improve on.\n1.) Your opening scene is too longEven in a traditional book it is best to keep your opening scene short. Your purpose is to introduce setting, character, and why a reader should continue reading. The reason I set my limit to around 1,000 words is because you need to accomplish those in about that length. Not all, but some readers will lose interest if you take too long in the first scene. I would suggest introducing something that clearly ends the scene, and moving the rest to your next episode. \n2.) You need a stronger hookThis goes back to ""why a reader should continue reading."" Within those first 1,000 words your readers should gain a basic understanding of the situation and be excited for what happens next. I could tell where you attempted this by introducing the ""I want to be a hero"" line. Also, you have already introduced some romantic interest and the MC\'s motivations, However, none of it came across as impactful or alluring. This is the most important thing for a first chapter and should be taken seriously.\n3.) You need better transitionsAt multiple points I had a hard time following the narrator\'s train of thought, as well as the MC\'s emotions. I think a little more internal monologue from the MC would help address this issue. The dialogue became confusing at points because focus of the narrator switches too often. To me the MC appeared to have drastic sways in emotions, which may appear more natural with more monologue of his thoughts. This is probably the least important thing as well as the hardest to fix. Therefore, it is up to you how much you want to focus on it.\nI hope this helps you! I will say again that I think your overall writing is quite excellent.', 'I honestly thought there would be more requests. However, as I said I will be unavailable for the next 12 hours. I will do my best to critique the novels that are requested during my absence, but I make no guarantees.', 'I promise to critique yours when I get back online', 'Thank you for your consideration ', ""Here's mine:\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nCrimson Love(BL)(COMPLETED) | Tapas\nMark is passionate and doesn't let his flaws hold him back.Akio is flawless on the surface.However,when they both cross paths,they are lead through a series of rape,drugs and even murder.Could these individuals be hiding more than there seems to...\n\n\n\n\n\nI actually have been looking for critiques since I am new to writing.It would be very kind if you can help me to find my mistakes."", ""I know you aren't currently online and you might choose not to, but I'd like to try anyway.\nIf you're willing, I'd really appreciate a critique on my novel.

Also, to be clear, the ""first chapter"" I focused on was your prologue since that should be the first thing the readers look at. Overall, the writing makes sense and is relatively easy to follow. I can see that despite not being a native speaker you are able to connect with your readers, obviously as your comments and subscribers shows. That being said, there are some things you can work on.\n1.) You really should get an editor or at least a native speaker to read over your writingAfter reading the prologue I noticed multiple mistakes that will force readers to either guess what you meant or re-read the sentence, because it didn\'t make sense the first time. Most of these mistakes are using the wrong tense or wrong conjugation. \nExamplesWhat you wrote: ""Lucky she had the pot exactly on the glass table in front of her sofa,...""What it should say: ""Luckily she had the pot exactly on the glass table in front of her sofa,...""What you wrote: ""...it was fortunate that she has not yet choked.""What it should say: ""...it was fortunate that she had not yet choked.""\nAs I said, you are connecting with your readers and these are not huge mistakes. Therefore, this is not a high priority. However, it will still detract from your meaning and make some readers lose interest that otherwise would not have. I suggest using a tool like Grammerly, if you can\'t find an editor, it will catch some of the mistakes you are making, though probably not all. You can even use the forums to find one. I am currently editing a comic for someone in exchange for drawings of my characters. \n2.) Don\'t overdo the detailsI understand the importance of creating an image for your readers. However, if you overdo the details it will seem like ""droning"". As authors we sometimes need to come up with creative ways to describe a scene. In your case, the ""droning"" was mostly occurring in the first 2 paragraphs where you are describing the character and setting. Doing this is fine, but it\'s not the real purpose of a first chapter. You should be focused on creating a hook that makes the readers want to read more. You have a pretty good hook, it just comes after this. Leaving some mystery, especially with the character, won\'t hurt you one bit. This is probably the hardest thing to fix, but something that, if learned successfully, will drastically improve your writing.\n3.) Don\'t throw out too many things the reader\'s won\'t understandI know I just said to leave some mystery. However, there is a fine line between some mystery and complete confusion. Fortunately, you are teetering on that line, but not quite over it. Some things don\'t seem to be confusing to us as writers, but they can somewhat throw a reader for a loop. Introducing new concepts or names is fine, but you can\'t hit a reader with too many at once. It will overload their heads with questions, which can distract them from how you want them to feel. Over the span of two sentences you introduce four new terms, ""Aylar Sub-District, Toryaemae District, Maiyean Regio, and SAR team."" If you were just introducing the first three I think you would be fine since the reader can tell they are places. However, before they form an image of what that looks like they see ""SAR team"" which will break their thought and cause confusion cause they don\'t understand what that is. This is not a major issue, but most readers won\'t get any valuable understanding, feel powerful emotions, or become curious when faced with that. They will just push it into the back of their minds. The best way to fix this is to try to read your novel as if you are just seeing it for the first time. This is difficult to do, but a valuable tool.\nOverall, your ""first chapter"" is pretty good. These are just ways I think will make it better. You keep it short, set the scenario, and the hook in the last two paragraphs is enough to keep most readers attention. The things iv\'e mentioned prevent you from having a strong buildup though. The better the buildup, the more impactful the hook. I hope this helps you and I wish you success.', '@lov2write @naito_official @poppyqueen01 \nI will try to get to your novels when I can.', ""I'd love a critique on my dark fantasy novel.

I also feel sorry it has been a chaotic and disappointing read  I appreciate your patience.\n\nFirst point, I'm painfully aware of that  Thank you for pointing out some mistakes, as I will edit it. It's true that non-native speaker is desensitized to mistakes. I have no beta reader; some among my readers have been pointing my horrendous grammar, but suggested me to edit later on when the entire thing is done. Yet I actually want to do it sooner if I had the ability to or find someone to do it for me, because I can see those judging eyes and embarrassment PS: Is grammarly free? I thought it is paid by its impression.\nI am very aware this is a concerning things even since the draft I made in my native language. I never get to edit it, though  The only reason I describe the woman here especially the focus on her mirror pendant is to enable call back from some future events and when she actually reveals herself (I know some people regard it as a bad move to make cameo of a late-appearing character early on)The tea is just food porn and to give her sophisticated air, maybe I should delete it  In the scraped draft of the prologue, I actually made she said something/talked to someone first before the god awful description (I forgot the details). I personally don't like it, but would it be helpful to add some action beforehand as a shortcut edit until I got a better idea?\nMaybe the temporary solution is cut the sentence up to the name of places? (SAR is search and rescue, I don't know what they're called in English)It's more of part of the news (as in news anchor says that) instead description that  is thought-invoking, emotional, or something. It only serves is purpose as background information that can be called back and will be brought up several times later.\nActually the entire point of this prologue is an earthquake happened and woman with mirror necklace is shook her jewelry does the glowy thing. The question of readers should be why is she shocked and what's with the earthquake.  The real story started eight months after this event with different characters as focus.  I just wondered if I did convey that, if not perhaps I have to throw the entire prologue to an incinerator.\n\nSorry if I ask too much, to be honest I'm very unfamiliar with technicalities of writing .

I will send a critique to you through PM.', '@lov2write about  What You\'ve Given Me\nSo I looked over your first chapter an noticed some things that need improving. However, understand that romance novels are the ones I am least familiar with, so I might misunderstand something. As you can see in my other reviews, I have to try to interpret what you are trying to do/say, while seeing how a reader reacts to what you actually say.\n1.) Unnecessary details / Over-detailedThe first thing that I noticed was that you put out a lot more details than necessary, especially in the beginning. \nExamples""...this morning at 7:03 a.m."" (in paragraph 1)""...Google-provided..."" (in paragraph 1)""..., as far as directions go."" (in paragraph 2)\nI understand that you are trying to establish the cold robot-like thinking of your MC, but it comes across as jumbled, unclear, and confusing. Part of this comes from the reader not knowing about the MC\'s condition (you can\'t assume everyone will read the synopsis). You can fix this by introducing why he thinks this way before your current paragraph 1, or you can introduce the cold robot-like thinking later when the MC\'s condition is explained. Either way, it is disorienting for the reader the way it is now.\n2.) Awkward phrasingAgain, I think you wrote things this way to express his weird way of thinking, but these aren\'t cold or robot-like they are just awkward. \nExample""...anything seemed better than really letting my mind stick to the main problem..."" Both ""really"" and ""stick"" just sound awkward in that sentence. The ""really"" is unnecessary and can be taken out. ""The ""stick"" just needs to be rephrased to something like ""letting my mind burnout by fretting over the main problem"". There are more instances of awkward phrasing, such as, ""my mental attitude attempt"" or ""...that thought centered in my mind..."" There are just better and clearer ways to phrase that.\nIt continues throughout the chapter and is something you will have to work at fixing. I think most of this could be caught by objectively re-reading before you post. If that doesn\'t work, have someone else read it for you and ask them to point out the awkward parts. I do like this part, ""...while waiting for the inhabitants to answer..."" Using the word ""inhabitants"" here implies no relationships to the people inside. However, you soon show that he does have a relationship with them. This is absolutely an effective way of showing his cold personality to your readers.\n3.) No hookThis may be partially due to my lack of experience with romance novels, but I don\'t see anything in the first chapter that would make a romance enthusiast continue reading. You basically spend the entire first chapter introducing character, background, and setting. I cannot express how important it is that you give your readers something to look forward to. How your MC thinks and interacts just isn\'t enough. Without a hook a novel seems dull, which is the number one reason readers drop a novel according to https://litworldinterviews.com/2016/06/03/why-readers-stop-reading-a-book/ Unfortunately, to do this you will have to seriously re-write your first chapter. Although, I think it would be worth it to you in the end\nI\'m sorry if my review seemed overly critical. I think your writing has a lot of potential and your understanding of the human physique shows in your writing which is key for a romance novel. If I had to guess, it looks like you overthink things and constantly make edits instead of just letting the writing flow. Try just writing it all out in one sitting and go back to fix little things after. I think your novel will flow better if you try that and it\'ll probably fix some of the issues I mentioned. I hope this helps and I wish you success.\nI will get to everyone else when I can', ""Thank you very much for the critique! I always look at my own work with the worst light, so anything anyone else says could never touch that. I understand I have a lot to work on, but certain aspects of the English language aren't my strong points, unfortunately. This will be very helpful for when I sit down and start major editing. Especially the hook thing. I've had a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to put some sort of hook in the first chapter or so, when this is more of a slow-burn/build sort of story.

","[""it's freaking awesome, i mean it, i love itI can feel the Steven Universe and Star Wars inspirations and i love that every episode is named after a song of David Bowie, is like you wrote this comic specifically for me, i love SU, i love space operas and i f**ing love David Bowie, if you could add some Guardians of the Galaxy antics, i would really go mad.i just want to ask what is the Aunt supposed to be, because she kinda reminds me CJ from regular show, she looks like a cloud, but the girl is human, so i wanna know...however i really like it, you just gained a new sub"", 'Oh, the mother WAS inspired by CJ! She is a sentient cloud from a not-shown-yet millennial society called the Cloud Theocracy. Also, they are adoptive mom and sister-like-friend aunt (i\'m gonna change the pages where she refers to Nimbus as ""aunt"". I thought it would be a quirky gimmick but it doesn\'t feel quite right).Also, I don\'t think I intend on adding a lot of Guardians of The Galaxy antics in this one, but I do intend on making more stories in this universe.

With the scrolling format you want to give your images room to breathe! For example your disclaimer is right on top of your cover and then you have a very minimal space between the cover and the first panel:\n\nimage.png811x546 177 KB\n\nAlso this is more of a personal preference thing - but I think it's odd that you update the episodes instead of just adding a new one. Not only will a lot of readers miss this - but you are also missing out on a lot of new readers because your comic will appear less in fresh. \nBack to the speech bubbles... this panel is a good example of some things you need to work on:\n\n1.)Font sizes - It's odd that you are using two different font sizes in one panel 2.) Tails intersect messily with the bubble - and the bubble shapes themselves are messy/ uneven3.) Spacing of the text - it would be better to center the text and space it out more evenly. There is a wonderful website that goes into depth on speech bubbles and how to lay them out but I can't remember it right now I will link it if I can find it again! \nI do like your use of different fonts for different characters, it immediately gives them a different feel- but sometimes you sacrifice legibility for mobile users.\nThe use of the same sized panels in two columns gets quite monotonous after awhile. I would recommend breaking up the flow with different sized panels and spacing. This would also allow for more room for your speech bubbles.\nJust an FYI these four panels seem to be duplicated :\nimage.png492x641 317 KB\n\nI do enjoy your character designs and world building. Everyone has a clear design and color palette. I also like that you take the time to add little details in the backgrounds - like these drawings on the walls:\n\nI like that in 'Life on Mars' you started taking the speech bubbles out of the constraints of the panels. It makes it feel more interactive:\n\nimage.png473x632 181 KB\n\nI also like that you started experimenting more with panel shapes and sizes. But the comic still feels claustrophobic. Don't be afraid of negative space! It can be just as powerful and important as the occupied spaces.\nIn 'Changes' your lines are a lot cleaner and the improvement is really evident. \nI hope these helped!

But...\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for that "", ""I felt this chapter did a lot of good characterization work, had plenty happening. Perhaps a bit more characterization up front, though, instead of at the end of the chapter? Because novels aren't movies, or a visual medium, action tends not to be as exciting or engaging in and of itself. It's more the emotional context of that action that makes it interesting.\nActually...Hmm, okay, I know it can be obnoxious to make really specific suggestions, but I do have one! Consider a version of this chapter that starts with the crew first spotting the ship, and her beginning to lead her first raid. With that context, it creates greater tension in the reader. We understand that Marion is doing something for the first time, that she is proving herself. It plants the question in the readers mind: 'Will she succeed, or let down her crew due to her inexperience?' Just a thought if you ever want to go back and revise this.\nAlso, I admit I don't know that much about pirates, but I always thought a lot of the appeal of the traditional pirate was the freedom and democracy aspect. Votes on captains, stuff like that. It seems rather strange in that context that Marion is taking over for her father, which sounds vaguely aristocratic, with the title of captain being passed down to her due to her blood.\nGenerally, though, thought it was pretty good!"", ""Hi Kitty, thank you so much for taking the time to read my first chapter and giving me your thoughts.I did think of starting from when they see the ship but I'll be honest I wasn't confident enough in my action writing skills  I'll probably revisit this chapter when I'm sure I can pull it off. As for Marion, the crew actually voted for her but it's something that I révèle in the next chapter because she had to do something terrible to prove herself worthy.Thank you so much again.

","[""The link doesn't work."", 'Maybe this link will work https://tapas.io/episode/132249724\nWhen I first saw the art style I thought, ""Ok cool, this is going to be a dramatic sci-fi story"". Then the characters started talking and it took an unexpected, but totally awesome turn. Your characters have such personalities and the dialogue is a lot of fun. Love the way they play off each other and I\'m looking forward to seeing what happens next!', 'Fixed the link bud ', 'Wow, thank you for that and also the right link ', 'I love sci-fi and highlight it especially among all genres. Also I really respect people, who can combine art with work. So I have been very interested in reading your work from the beginning.\nI\'ve already said in another topic, devoted to this comics, that I liked the prologue. Now let me specify myself a bit about it: first of all, I liked the mistery atmoshpere and declared conception. As well as, of course, the art style. I\'ve said something about ""strange"" guy\'s expression, but now I reread the prologue and haven\'t notice anything wrong with it. Have my perception been changed or you really have changed the last frame? \nNow, closer to the current topic... I\'m glad to see the continuation of the story. Art here is still beautiful and neatly done. Action poses of the characters are pretty dynamic. But what I didn\'t like so much is the dialog and the conception of this fight scene in general...The main characters are ranting about detached stuff right in the battle, instead of concentrating on the action itself. But by the logic, they\'d better really concentrate on it, because the enemies have ranged weapons, and probably deadly ones (?). Inattentiveness to the deadly weapons could easily lead to the death of MC and the end of the story (well, at least it would be so in a real world).Also I have no idea, why the enemies have entered melee fight, if they have these guns? At their place, I would keep the distance and use ranged weapon before the MC would reach me physically and kick in the face. The whole scene would seems more logical if enemies hadn\'t ranged weapon at all.As a summary, all of this reminds Hollywood action movies about all these super-duper guys, scattering away tons of faceless bad bois single-handedly, and managing to bragging their coolness in the same time. And honestly I\'m not fan of it. Such a things instantly make everything less serious in my opinion.', ""i like the art style, really well done and fitting to a sci-fi story,i just have a problem with the dialogue, it's weird and out of place, for example, they are talking about a tv show where the woman acted (is she an actress?) and talking about the shoes she had wear doing that ... in the middle of a fight... i don't know, it feels kinda random, but, besides that, it looks fine, it has a lot of potential"", 'Thank you for the awesome feedback!!! This is what I was trying to show, is that they are so badass they can have a random conversation while in battle, but the next part will show that all changes once The Three jump into the loop. Notice how they coloring went back to normal once Airith noticed the ships?', ""No, I myself wasn't so attentive to notice that the coloring style have changed when I've read it the first time.  Now I've re-check it and it seems, that after noticing the ships they have become colored with more broad strokes... So is it an artistic reception of some kind, which express changing of the tone of the story?\n\nAlso, I'd suggest to collect feedback to all of the future episodes (when they will be released) in one topic, instead of creating the new ones every time? It probably would be more convenient for everyone. But your choice "", ""The art is beautiful, but the expressions don't necessarily fit the tone of the dialogue. It sorta feels like could replace solemn, serious dialogue in the word-bubbles and the expressions could remain the same.  Winks, smirks, grins, or even bored expressions as they effortlessly blow through hoards of mooks might be more appropriate for snarkiness.\nWhile all of the individual drawings are great, I'm not sure how well they flow together? I'm not as experienced with vertical comics, but the panels feel like lots of large, isolated images that don't necessarily flow together to suggest action.\nSize of a panel plays a major role in how it is percieved by the reader. We linger on large panels to take in all the details, and we brush over small panels. The majority of panels in this feel like large, full page illustrations, which means each of them takes a while to take in and scroll past.\nThere are some smaller panels, but it's not clear exactly how the choices are made. I think a good example of this is the panel of the three ship..plane...things. The ships are a dramatic, new element adding to the scene, and physically large, but their panel is small, so we only get a glimps of them. On the other hand, we get a 'full page' illustration after it featuring just the female protagonist's face. By the same token, many full page panels of just her chest area while we're getting dialogue through here key thingy (which is a cool element, btw).\nThere's also the issue of geography. This is very important for an action scene, so the reader can understand what's going on. We see the two heroes, we see the bad guys, but we don't see where they are in relation to one another. It's like a series of individual pinups of characters that aren't in the same physical space.\nAnd, er, to be honest, I kinda have no idea what's going on? They're going to try to awaken 'Mother', and someone is trying to stop them? \nHope this is useful!

It is supposed to be a heartfelt story about how life changes very suddenly, and how stressing it can be. It incorporates some elements of Steven Universe that I previously thought to be very interesting and nice. Could you please take a look at it and tell me what I'm doing wrong?

Everdream: Stars Hold no Boundaries. | Tapas
https://www.facebook.com/LuccaFerreiraVendramel/
Everdream: Stars Hold no Boundaries is a coming of age metaphor set in a distant galaxy, where a girl named Cozmata lives with her adoptive mom and her aunt in a planet called Juuna. It is a...






PRE PRODUCTION NOTES AND PLANNING (only Chapter 1, 2 & 3 scripts made so far):
CHAPTER 1 (Moonage Daydream)Introduction of Characters and Story (Cozmata and Henry go to the bad part of the city because Cozmata wanted to do something exciting for a change. She gets her and Henry caught up in the Company’s business by being attacked by an Eyebot [The Company being a presumed-dead economical organization that sold weapons in the Federo-Etherian War which happened 15 years before the events of the comic])
CHAPTER 2 (Lady Stardust)Lady Stardust Introduction (Lady Stardust is introduced and is set to have a past with the Company, she warns Cozmata about it and Cozmata gets extremely stressed and anxious, fearful of the Company [EXPANDED ON CHAPTER 4])
CHAPTER 3 (Life on Mars) EV-4 Introduction (EV-4, the EVs, Sassypants and the Director are introduced. EV-4 decides to set off to Earth to understand what’s causing the eliminations of so many Eyebots in so little time [which is Cozmata]. She accidentally gets a Commando Eyebot with her in the Space Shuttle, which she nicknames Sassypants. They crash land on Juuna and are captured by pirates and EV-4 is given the chance to duel for their lives. She shoots before the countdown is over and the pirates get mad at them. They escape on one of the pirate hovers [speeders] and the chapter ends with them going towards Cozmata's house in the horizon).
CHAPTER 4 (Changes)Cozmata Character Development (Cozmata starts getting paranoid about the Company coming to get her and her family, chapter ends with her family reassuring that it will be okay and that they’ll always be together, with EV-4 appearing at the end asking for help outside the house, picking up on where chapter 3 ended).
CHAPTER 5 (Where Are We Now?): EV-4 Character Development - After escaping from the pirates, she meets up with the crew. After getting there, Cozmata sees the eyebot and is aggressive towards her, after EV-4 sees the remains of the eyebots, she says that she sent them and asked who destroyed them. Cozmata says how she tried to kill her and EV-4 says that the eyebots weren’t trying to eliminate her, but probably a Mark experiment, and she got caught in the action. She says that they didn’t see any “Mark Experiment, and that the only ones she were with were people. EV-4 confirms it, and says that they had to be eliminated to destroy any remains of the Old Company and start anew. Cozmata says that she was killing people, and EV-4 shows to not understand what is the meaning of death. Cozmata explains to her, making an analogy to having your memory wiped out, and since EV-4 herself has a great fear of being rebooted, she realizes what she was doing all along. She says that she’ll help to stop these attacks by going back and sabotaging the eyebot database. But that they need to help her rebuild her pod. Cozmata agrees, and she asks where she could stay. It cuts to Cozmata telling Henry about it, and Henry offering a place for EV-4 to stay for the day while Cozmata and the others empty a room for her to stay. EV-4 is taken to Henry’s house, and hidden. As his sister goes to the shop, she brags about the problem in the cash register. Henry asks if there’s anything he can do to help, but she says he’s too young. EV-4 stays the whole day at Henry’s house while his mom and sister are off, and she inspects the house trying to find out what is made for what. When Henry comes back, he explains that everything is made to help his mom on the house. He leaves for a few minutes to attend her sister, and while he’s gone, EV-4 makes a contraption out of home appliances that could help his mom, and that contraption starts running and trashing the house, and they have to stop it. After they do, Henry talks to her about why she did that, and she explains she wanted to help, but couldn’t. Henry says that she is like him, wanting to help but not knowing how. She comments on how she feels extremely guilty because she killed people not even knowing. Henry comforts her saying that she should work on bettering herself in the future. They hear a knocking on the door and it is Nimbus. She picks up EV-4 and takes her back. The chapter ends with EV-4 taking off her helmet and throwing it on the sands, representing her disaffiliation with the Company. It is revealed that Sassypants watched her do that right before the chapter ends, hinting that he is up to something.  
CHAPTER 6 (Wild is The Wind):Keen & Nimbus Character Development (They both go search for a piece to EV-4 in the city. Before they go, Cozmata asks to go with them, but they say she should help EV-4 with her pod. After not finding it, they ask the town sheriff which is an old friend of Nimbus where they could find the part. The sheriff points to the bad side of the city and there they go. They discover a small drug trafficking operation inside a shop in the bad part of the city when snooping around after the piece. They find it, but they've got to sneak towards it. They alert the traffickers accidentally, and while Nimbus tries to talk them out of the situation, Keen knows they'll be killed. Keen notices the water they knocked over and that alerted the traffickers is right under them, so she just kicks the wire extension that kept the lights on, killing all of the traffickers and allowing them to go home safely. When they get out, they go home. There, the chapter ends with them giving Cozmata the part for her to give to EV-4, and Cozmata saying she hoped it wasn't too much trouble.)
CHAPTER 7 (TVC 15):Keen Character Development - Cozmata goes scavenging with her and EV-4, who came along to look for a part to fix her ship. Keen and Cozmata go to a ruin they never went to, before. They walk along the ship, and EV-4 starts asking about the nature of the ships they normally find. Cozmata explains that most ships are of exploration or warrish nature, and most are either Federational or Etherian. They reach a very big room, and in there they go about looking for the parts they need. Cozmata falls through a crumbling floor to a lower level, and after EV-4 and Keen failing to get Cozmata (because they refuse to work together), Cozmata is told by Keen (by gestures) to walk until she finds a set of stairs, and that they’d meet up soon. Keen and EV-4 walk until they reach a big lab. In the lab, they find out it was a Federational ship, and discover that this ship was a lab ship by seeing loads of research equipment. While they wait for the elevator, they listen to some weird sounds from the upper floor. When the elevator doors open, EV-4 screams for Cozmata. They receive no answer. Keen turns on a GPS device on her belt that will take them to Cozmata. They go and reach Cozmata’s GPS, and after picking it up they hear something coming in their direction. Keen pulls out a hand cannon and an infected person came out of the shadows. The person is deformed and walking slowly. As soon as it sees Keen and EV-4, it runs towards them, with Keen shooting it several times. After the creature is dead, they hear Cozmata screaming for them. They run towards Cozmata, and when reaching her, they see her inside a room. The wall behind her had collapsed, allowing her to reach this dead end. A creature similar to the one Keen killed falls behind Cozmata, and Keen desperately tries to open the door, which is broken. She starts throwing herself against the glass separating them. EV-4 looks at Cozmata, then at Keen. It’s her chance of doing something right. She throws herself against the glass too, breaking it. Keen shoots the infected being and hugs Cozmata, with tears on her eyes. Cozmata thanks EV-4, which gets happy with finally doing something good. They hear more sounds, and run back to the elevator. As soon as they reach it, a big infected cluster stops them, making them run towards the stairs. The creature chases them, and Cozmata presses a button that shuts a door on the monster when they reach the floor they came in through. Keen goes towards the computer there was in the lab, and looks for anything that could kill the monsters. EV-4 tells her to step aside, and using her technical skills, hacks into the mainframe of the ship, rigging it to explode. They run off, but right before the entrance, the floor collapses on Cozmata again. But this time, Keen catches her, and EV-4 catches Keen. They manage to run out of the ship and it explodes when they are far from it. Before they go back home, Cozmata thanks EV-4 and Keen puts her hand on EV-4’s shoulder, and the chapter ends with them going home, EV-4 feeling like she was ready to start again. 
CHAPTER 8 (Let's Dance):Nimbus Character Development – Cozmata and Henry arrange a date between Nimbus and Gary; a courier who has been Nimbus’ crush for quite a while and who has had a crush on Nimbus. The date is arranged in a diner of the Hub and ended up different from what the kids wanted, but good anyways. At the end, a Company abduction ship arrives and Keen is captured, revealing that Sassypants communicated the Company about her. Keen and him are taken by the ship and it flashes away.
CHAPTER 9 (Golden Years): Nimbus is fixing a ship that she won in a gambling deal a long time ago to rescue Keen. She starts fixing it along with Cozmata, and Cozmata hears about how they met. Nimbus tells her that she was wrongly accused of being a traitor to the Cloud Theocracy and was banned from it, falling in Juuna and meeting Keen, who tries to get her adjusted to life in the plain lands. The ship is almost fixed by the end of the episode.
CHAPTER 10 (Ashes to Ashes): They are checking their provisions and fixing more things, then they realize they need more protection, so Cozmata goes to the city with Henry to look for Lady Stardust (After she asks him if he wants to help her, as it can be dangerous. She learned to respect other's opinions and preferences). They find her and try to convince her to go. She refuses to go out of fear. They are attacked by Agatha (who is now a Company mark-hunter). She gets shot and wounded and they bring her to the crew's home. When she wakes up, she is stripped from all her weapons. After noticing she is Agatha, LS wants to talk to her. After a pirate raid that was looking for EV-4 attacks, Lady Stardust protects Agatha while she is tied up. That makes Agatha start rethinking her conceptions about LS, but doesn't quite forgiving her yet.
CHAPTER 11 (Oh! You Pretty Things):They are still fixing and rechecking everything to board. Lady Stardust chats with Agatha and when Agatha gets untied, she doesn't have the courage to kill Lady Stardust, so she runs away. Lady Stardust goes after her and she talks to her, convincing her to give Lady Stardust another chance. She does, reluctantly.
CHAPTER 12 (Space Oddity) :They are loading to board. Cozmata, Nimbus, EV-4, Agatha and Lady Stardust board while Henry stays at Juuna because he's too afraid (This scene shows how Cozmata learned to let Henry take his own decisions and to keep him out of things he doesn’t want to be part of). They go to space and EV-4 realizes she knows only half of the map to the location, as it must have been erased from her memory to prevent any invasions. They have to visit the capital planet to get information from a guy Lady Stardust knows. They board the planet, and after some world building and misadventures, Cozmata, Agatha and LS reach the place LS's friend would supposedly be. (AGATHA'S CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT)
CHAPTER 13 (I'm Afraid of Americans):Lady Stardust takes Cozmata & Agatha to see the person that would be able to say where the Company space station is, but they find out the place is just the beginning of a couple of codes that would reveal his location. They find the person through the use of hints and codes left by him. The person finds the place using their technology and following hints they've been collecting for years. They say the crew has only 12 chances in 100 of surviving and succeeding.
CHAPTER 14 (Rock 'n' Roll Suicide):Cozmata and the others are very worried, and they start doubting if they should really proceed with this suicide mission. Nimbus is determined to proceed, while Cozmata & Lady Stardust think they will die. Agatha is going along, as she wants to study Lady Stardust and see if she has truly changed.They get ambushed by Ol’ Jack Pirates and have to team up so they get rid of them. At the end, Agatha trusts Lady Stardust more. They proceed to the space station, after almost all reaching a consensus that they'll save Keen.
CHAPTER 15 (Starman): They arrive in the Company's location, and Nimbus has to go out in space to open an entrance (which EV-4 tells them about).She opens the entrance and all of them enter through space. They start going through the hallways to look for Keen. Keen is shown to be in a white, empty cell alone. She manages to escape after a scientist in a screen explains what her purpose is. Cozmata, Nimbus, Agatha, Lady Stardust and EV-4 split up, but not before EV-4 tracks down Keen’s cell. EV-4, LS and Agatha go to sabotage the Eyebot mainframe, and Cozmata and Nimbus go to rescue Keen. They do, after she escapes by learning about her hidden peculiarity, after a computer tells her why she is there (which is because of the Mark program, that made genetically engineered kids, put them in test families and took them back to see how they had behaved towards other humans. They escaped after they found out they were gonna be killed because of the Company's bankrupcy. The Marks are now being eliminated to destroy any remains of the Old Company and start anew on the Director’s plan.She finds EV-4’s group and the Cozmata’s group gets to the place where Keen would be. Cozmata tries opening the door, but she is teleported to a room, alone. Nimbus is right after communicated that EV-4 found Keen. In there, she meets the Director (which is an AI), which explains that he had been rebuilding the Company after the indirect bankruptcy the Federation inflicted on them when they found out the Company was selling weapons to both sides during the Federo-Etherian War. And now that the station has been discovered he must destroy everything about the Mark project. Cozmata convinces him that the EVs don’t need to die, and that they can go live in Juuna. The Director hadn’t thought about this outcome as he didn’t expect the invaders to be peaceful enough to allow them to escape. As the EVs are entering the space shuttles, two Federation of United Planets fighters show up, revealing that the way to the station had been found by the route that Nimbus’ ship made. The pilots try to ask for reinforcements but by the time they arrive at the station and ask for it, it’s too far off the Federation communication net. The Director stays behind while he distracts the fighters and Cozmata along with the EVs and the crew escape. The Director self-destructs the station, erasing the Company forever and destroying the two fighters. The series ends with the EVs putting up a statue of the Director, and Cozmata coming along with the fact life is always changing, and these changes are chances of good things coming to you.","[""The link don't work.

Hidden Eden
After surviving a devastating crash in enemy territory, Lukas, a young military trainee, is inundated with doubts of his homeland’s intentions in the war. He must distinguish truths from lies and determine for himself the place he calls home.






Thanks in advance to anyone who takes a look at this! Would definitely appreciate any feedback.
(also sidenote: any Webtoon creators notice an increase in subscribers when you have 3 episodes out? When I'm reading on Webtoon a popup asking if I want to subscribe always appears on the 3rd update so I'm curious to see if that affected any of you at all!)","[""There's not much to comment on yet, but the first few things I noticed were the appropriately big text and easy to follow panelling. That sequence where Lukas was just looking at his hand was really ominous too, I liked it a lot.\nI would say the characters' poses look kinda awkward though. It might help if you have some sort of anatomically proportionate figurine that you can pose freely to use a reference. If not, try googling up some pictures.\nGood luck on your comic "", ""I'm glad you liked the paneling on his hands! That was one of my favorite parts and I'm happy you noticed it.\nVery true I have a tendency to draw poses mostly from memory and it can end up looking quite stiff. Gotta get on those figure studies lol! I tend to just draw faces when I'm doodling so I would definitely benefit from drawing the entire form.\nJust checked out your comic and it's so intriguing! I subscribed but I'm sad to see it's already over (but at least I have a lot of material to binge on haha!)\nThanks for taking the time to leave a review! I appreciate it."", ""Congratulations on posting your comic!! the style looks very polished and neat. The color palette is beautiful and pleasing to the eye.  The action is very easy to understand through panels and mobile users and visually impaired people can appreciate the big text, some texts are huge in my opinion. The architecture and vehicle design are very good! the thumbnail is very eye-catching and beautiful, the only thing is that it doesn't tell us much about the story or the character, or even the genre.  In a way, the thumbnail helps us to summarize the identity of the comic. \nSome proportions are inconsistent, and at times the anatomy is odd but you will get better very soon as you keep working on your comic  \nThe next point is a very small detail, the lines that indicate movement seem a little misplaced at times. For example in the second panel with the steps the lines are in the wrong direction, and when he faints there are not action lines. He is conscious in one panel and the next panel he is already on the floor, adding the lines could help us understand  that he just fell.  This sounds very irrelevant but some details like this help comics to look more professional. \nKeep up with the good work!"", ""I'm glad it helped. And thank you for subscribing to Broken World! It's been over for a few months now so I was surprised to see it in my notification box XD"", 'I\'m going to be very neutral with this, I just want to point the most egregious errors that stuck out to me. \nThe cabin design is really what broke my immersion immediately. He\'s sitting on a chair that has zero back support, and allows the user to lean their backs against full wall length window panes on a military aircraft. With no belt, or other means of securing a person in. This is a majorly flawed design that would not pass any basic safety inspection. I understand that it\'s a futuristic aircraft, but someone banging their head against that glass pane could happen from the most minor of turbulence. There\'s a lot of other questions this kind of design raises. It looks civilian to me because of the full length window, but I know this is a military craft. This giant window has the potential to expose the interior to enemy craft, allow people to plummet to their death should they take on fire (assuming it\'s some form glass and maybe not some other kind of windownoium material), a potential loss of armour or other structural support (I have a hard time believing this window material is going to be stronger and safer than whatever sort of metal material this plane is made from, given the window is very obviously placed for the luxury of the cabin\'s inhabitant [which is also unusually spacious for military, they tend to be very utilitarian. They never sacrifice practicality for luxury.]) \nThe other issue with this scene is on an artistic level. The only reason we know something happens to the plane which causes the MC to bang his head, is that giant bold letters ""BAAM"" were written on the panel behind the plane. Nothing about the plane\'s trajectory, visually, changed. Remove the sound effect and nothing happened. It could be as simple as adding minor movement affects such as blurring to the panels where it\'s still moving, but something really needs to distinguish what actually happened to the craft here, and why specifically it caused a ""baam"" and not any other type of sound. Was the ""baam"" the engines stopping mid-flight? Was it something inside that collided because of a sudden stop? Etc. \nFor this sequence of events to have taken place (character getting injured), something fundamentally different needs to allow it to happen in such a way that it wasn\'t just poor safety standards. It\'s too contrived as a plot as it stands right now. \nDialogue issue: The receptionist where she mentions the word ""flight"" twice in the same speech bubble. You kind of get away with this since it\'s dialogue and people will repeat themselves in real life. Though I\'m wondering if it\'s meant to be ""Head towards gate number 1048"" since that\'s how it\'s usually said. You go to your gate, to get on your flight.  \nSFX issue: ""Step"" isn\'t a sound effect, it\'s an action. ""Tap"", ""Tip"", ""clunk"", etc are. It\'s like writing a character to say ""laugh"" instead of ""haha"".  A step is the action you took, ""tip"" is more likely the sound your shoe made depending on the type and surface you connected with.\nI would also suggest drawing the two feet walking in unison. The panels used to show walking were a little awkward, especially because they\'re flat angles on one subject at a time where both legs are actually in motion and both belong to the subject (MC) being introduced. For example you can put the first three panels into one just by using a worm\'s eye view of the guy\'s feet walking up towards the building. It probably doesn\'t have the effect you want, but the idea is to think more dynamically and avoid flat angles where possible.', ""Thank you for your kind comments! I'm glad that you think the panels are easy to follow. I remember reading so many forum topics with people mentioning how text is an issue with beginners so maybe I overcompensated a bit haha.\nI can't take much credit for the architecture as they were models from Sketchup (such a lifesaver!).\nI definitely agree about the thumbnail- I feel like it's not engaging enough. I'm pretty stumped about what to include though so I'll do a mini brain-storming session and see what I can come up with. Same goes with the anatomy. It's always been a struggle for me and Lukas tends to be inconsistent in height in every other panel. Hoping with more references and practice that it'll start to look more natural.\nI never noticed the action lines for the section panel I'll try to be more mindful of that the next time! And I definitely could have used more action lines in the last panel or maybe an extra panel of him mid-fall (I was just too lazy to draw it but considered it- will be less lazy next time!)."", 'Wow thanks for all the food for thought!\nIt\'s definitely true that I didn\'t think much about the practicality of the ship\'s design. It does get confusing as my summary mentions military training/war to have an aircraft that doesn\'t really speak to that. I did mean for it to be a commercial aircraft although now that I think about it, even a commercial plane would have back support/seat belts. I\'m debating if I should go back and just add a seat back and seatbelt since it hopefully won\'t take too much time.\nAdding some motion effects definitely would help add clarity to the ""BAAM"" panel! It\'s a simple fix so I\'ll work on improving that panel. What happened to the aircraft is intentionally supposed to be a mystery which won\'t be revealed for a while but I did get a few people confused about that in the comments so I\'m thinking of adding some dialogue to future episodes that will hopefully add some clarity to that aspect.\nAhh that was the word I was looking for! I noticed the awkward dialogue you mentioned (using flight twice) before but couldn\'t remember what the proper term was haha. Thanks for pointing it out! I will definitely fix that before episode 2 comes out. I\'ll also change the SFX issue you mentioned as well. It\'s definitely the little details that count!\nThe first two walking panels I definitely do think are not very dynamic but for now I\'ll keep them as is. If I remember correctly I was just trying to get the 35 panel count Webtoons wanted for their contest (which I obviously ended up not joining lol!)\nYour critique was very helpful and thoughtful. Will be making those changes before episode 2 comes out! ', ""I agree with @spudfuzz they made a lot of valid points. \nTo expand on the art, Your line art is very sketchy, lines often overlap or do not join properly. Doing one final pass with your line art and cleaning up these issues will make a huge impact! \nAnother small nitpick - the blood from his head wound is missing on the glass in the last panel. \nYour sets are very plain, which makes the world feel barren and unlived in ( I can struggle with this one too ). Your backgrounds tell a story too. For example at the receptionist's desk what would she need to complete her job? You've created the sets but you haven't done any set dressing. This also relates heavily to the design of the plane which again was covered by @spudfuzz, so I won't re-hash it again.\nCongratulations on launching your comic though! The first episode is always the hardest!"", ""Hello Kittosaurus! Thanks for taking the time to review.\nI definitely noticed the lineart problems too (especially when I was adding the flat colors) and will work on making it cleaner for the next episode.\nI always tend to forget the details like the blood on the glass (I forgot to add the pillows on the seat to the last panel so had to add that in last minute too heh). Thanks for letting me know I'll go back and edit that as well.\nI agree with the notes about the background/sets! They tend to be my least favorite part of drawing so I skim over them without much thought but adding more details in that area is something I can definitely improve in. I might go in and add a few things to make it seem a little less barren. I could probably use a few more background people in the scenes too since it seems like only two people exist in my world right now haha!\nAnd thank you! I'm really excited to see how comic-making will improve my artistic abilities and making the first episode was definitely a challenge. Best wishes for your series as well!"", ""No problem!

Maybe consider combining them.\n@ForLackOfStars I'm getting Star Wars cantina meets Snow White's poison apple from this — so like a fantasy story set in a quirky and deadly bar? If that's what you're going for, then great! Overall, I think the contrast and composition are good, but at the same time I think it feels empty. Maybe consider adding some texturing to the whole thing or a subtle pattern to the background — especially if said pattern has a motif that's significant to the main character or plot. I also think that the text, while easy to read, lacks character. You might be able to get more information across by picking another font.\n\nHere's the thumbnail for my novella:\n\nI adapted it from this cover that I made (click for full size):\n\nI've been staring at it for so long that I have no idea what it might look like to other people.Any feedback is appreciated!"", ""@echoeotto I personally think your cover is already good, I like the flow, composition, and typography.

The only thing I feel that could be improved is to slow down the start. Could just be  my personal taste of not liking to be thrown right into action but building up to it slowly. You could do that by spreading out the panels a little or making more establishing shots. Maybe even a title card will do. Otherwise I feel like I have no idea where it's going but that's no problem at all, just makes it more exciting than anything. I also love the character design!"", 'Art is great.

I'm sorry if this is irrelevant."", 'looks great so far to me!i honestly don\'t love the font you chose for the text, its a bit thin, & the changes in text size are pretty obvious in confusing? but i dont think its something worth redoing it for so lolthe art is absolutely fantastic, i love how clean it is, the exprssions and movments read very clearly and the shots/positioning and even like, the way the panels interact with eachother is very dynamic!i feel like we should get to know what the plot is going to be about a bit sooner (im a bit fan of establishing pages, esp first page intros, giving u the info u need on what the plot\'s gonna be) unless it\'s just ""daily life of a vampire"" in which case godspeed', ""Actually he's suppose to be simple minded and goofy so that's good  sorry it's not your thing though"", 'Yes it sort of is the daily life.

Good job on creeping me out.', 'I like the art style and vibe of the comics so far. Especially mysterious and stylish is the beginning scene with the nuns. Pictures of the city and futuristic computer interface (?), as well as character designs look good, too.Some scenes are a bit hard to fully understand because of lack of the details and of the background art. For example, it is so at the page 8, where girl is jumping/flying from the creature and saying ""get out"". Have she jumped off by herself or the creature have pushed her? Where has she turned out to be after that?  I haven\'t the full picture of this scene in my head because of lack of the information.Unfortunately, I can\'t say much about plot yet. There is some intrigue and mystery, but it is not revealed yet. I think I\'ll wait for the new updates to learn more.

I apologize that it wasnt clear on what happened on page 8 she was sent flying by the creature  but perhaps it was a bit difficult and unclear qwq ....', ""It definitely has an intriguing and creepy vibe from the get go. The story has a good pacing, keep up the good work!\nThis isn't particularly a problem yet since there's still only one featured character, but it would be better if you keep the 'tails' of the speech balloons, since it clarifies who is speaking what. I also see that you used both Japanese and English onomatopoeia for SFX, and I think it would look more consistent if you just stick to one of them.\nI had difficulty understanding a few parts of the story (for example, page 5). Try zooming out of the characters so that we can see more of the backgrounds, where the characters are and where they're heading. I know background sucks for some, but it doesn't have to be complicated! If it's something that isn't particularly important to the story or is really far behind, you can just draw the silhouette of it.\nGood luck on your comic ""]",1/13/2019 0:52,https://forums.tapas.io/t/polishing-up-review-my-story/30440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

473,"Meaty Reviews Season 2 (Post Your Comic, Get a Meaty Review) (Finished)",Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'd like to once again invite anyone who is hungry for thorough and honest feedback to post their comic. If you post your comic, I will read as much of it as I practically can and then give you as meaty a review as I deem appropriate. 
What you should know about me: I've only been here for 3-4 months, and I am in no way a professional or successful artist. I have a hard time engaging with anime/slice of life/school drama/quirky comedy. This doesn't mean I won't read yours, it just means I do not have as refined a palate for those niches. I have no intention of passing judgement on any comic. This is not me writing reviews for consumers. I am only here to say what I think is working and what is not working in your comic. I have no intention of subscribing to any comic I do not genuinely love.
You are welcome to review my comic (and I am as hungry as anyone for feedback), but THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO DO SO. Giving reviews is time consuming, I definitely understand.

Meaty Reviews Season 1 (Post your Comic, Get a Meaty Review) (Closed) Reviews


    I'm new to the webcomic scene (a few months). That said, I have seen an astonishingly vast number of people, across all webcomic forums, ask for meaningful critiques and receive few or no responses. The ratio of requests to answers is heartbreaking. Even here, which seems one of the more active forums, the Review category is comparatively tiny compared to its counterparts. Lots of people are asking, and comparatively few are answering. 

Anyway, the point is that I want to try and answer the cal…
  



TL;DRPost your comic, get a meaty, VERY honest, but NEVER mean-spirited review. I am here only to encourage.When you post your comic, give me:--1-3 sentence premise (Whether this is a pitch or a conceptualization, it makes no difference--or does it?)--Genre and >>>TONE<<<--Summary of your intentions and expectations. What are you trying to do with this comic? What is your target AUDIENCE? How would you rank yourself among other comics you see?
I will take between 12-15 total entries this week.
I hope I can be of some service you guys. God knows I've gotten game changing advice.","['For those of us who posted round 2 entries on the last thread, should we copy/paste those to this one for ease of access?

When the town\'s most important treasure is stolen and the group of Treasure Hunters are requested to retrieve it, the young mage must quickly learn how to leverage the skills he does have to help his friends get the treasure back.\nThe big picture, one sentence version is: it\'s a study in problem solving within a fantasy setting when you can\'t just brute force your way through your problems, as fantasy characters can often be seen doing.\nGenre: Fantasy / Action\nTone: Mostly light hearted and fun, although with serious moments sprinkled in. \nIntentions: I began TH!! solely as a means to learn ""how to comic"", as I had dabbled in comic making in the past but never taken a serious swing at it. A brief history is: from 2007~2017 I had fallen into the trap of trying to write a ""magnum opus"" in middle school, and carried that with me all the way past college. At the start of this year as I was doing the umpteenth reboot, I finally thought ""this is dumb, I could write much better stories than continuing to cling to this baggage from middle school"". So I dropped it, and began writing TH!! in January/February. It\'s a 50ish page one-shot, which I figured would be long enough to apply a decent plot to but short enough to finish in a reasonable amount of time. The writing is admittedly ""just okay"", imo (hoping to apply what I learn to the next project, this one\'s written and halfway drawn already xD) but more so I\'ve been trying hard to improve my art as I go. Beefing up my backgrounds, learning more about perspective, un-wonkying hands, working on anatomy, picking up coloring techniques, trying to make better and better panel layouts, etc. Those are the things I hope continue to improve until the end.\nExpectations: Pretty low, tbh. I don\'t have any sub number or anything I\'m actively working towards. My only hope is to build something of an audience as a starting point for future projects ^^ I already have more subs and interaction than expected so I\'m pretty happy. Can only improve from here!\nTarget Audience: Pretty much ages 10 and up or something lol. A lot of my drawing and writing style is pretty heavily influenced by shonen anime/manga, and I\'m kind of aiming at that crowd. \nedit:\nRank: Average, I guess xD There are tons of art and writing in similar genres that i see better than my own, but also many worse.

I know my work is still rife with issues, so I\'m eagerly awaiting which stand out the most to you, and hopefully tackle those hard moving forward ^^', ""I am nervous to ask but also dying to have some critique, so here goes! My comic is Princess, Sign Here\nPremise: Fairy-Tale romances get their start in a DMV-style building where princesses wait in line to choose a monster/place to be rescued from. The main character, Jackie, works at this building (the Department of Mis-placed Princesses or D.M.P.), and she experiences all the ups and downs of working 9 to 5 in customer service. .... but with dragons sometimes.\nGenre: Comedy / FantasyTone: Cartoony & slapstick, like a saturday morning cartoon\nIntentions: My biggest intention is to vent my personal experiences working in retail/customer service. I also have a deep love of everything cartoony & animated, so my secondary goal is to make this comic mimic those shows I watched growing up (and the ones I'm watching currently).\nAs you can see from the first 7-ish comics, I tried to have a much looser format akin to a graphic novel, and I hated it. My revised intent presentation-wise was to follow the traditional comic-strip format, with 4 panels and a punchline for each strip. I draw a lot of influence from Penny-Arcade, PVP, and Calvin & Hobbes in that regard.\nAudience: This is actually an excellent question! First and foremost I was making this for myself, to vent and also to hone my drawing/joke telling skills. But beyond that....? Young adults I suppose? I'd like to think I'm making these accessible enough for anybody of any age, but I do have a couple darker jokes planned for the future that are less kid-friendly, haha.

This story based on a roleplaying game created and played by the authors.\nGenre/Tone: Sci Fi, Drama, Adventure. Mostly serious.\nIntentions/expectations: I had two goals in mind; (1) to improve my art and (2) to remember the adventures some friends and I had while creating and playing a tabletop RPG. I started drawing this after almost 2 years of not picking up a pencil, so yeah, the first chapter's art sucks, but I had to start somewhere. Chapter length is intended to be about the amount you need to make an American-style comic book, and also because I like updates that lead to some significant progress in the story. I know many people here like single-page updates, so I might be a bit of an oddball here. Anyways, if some day I get to the point where I can draw a whole chapter and feel the quality is worth printing, I plan to re-draw the older ones and make a print version just for fun. Until then, I'm keeping the page size small because I'd like to improve some artistic aspects first (dynamism, proportions, perspective, etc).\nTarget Audience: my friends and I.

The robots are continuing to fight the war the humans started and in an effort to ensure a winner ordered all construction types to no longer be created. 100 years later a Build-bot was created by an unknown order/being and both sides are now watching her very carefully as she tries to make things.\nGenre: Sci fi/post apocalyptic\nTone: There are serious moments with lightheartedness as well. It should be noted we plan on things slowly becoming more serious as the story goes on.\nIntentions: Joan the Writer (and wife!)- I literally dreamed up this story many years ago and my husband and I hashed out what we thought would happened. We work on the story together with each of us taking up certain characters to determine what their reactions and interactions would be like-which is very helpful when I get stuck. I would personally like to get more readers and it would be nice if one day (dream mode activated here) we got enough readers and support to let my husband quit his job and stay home making comics all day.Overall intentions from me for this story is to tell that story I know from start to finish in my head, solidify it, and tell it to anyone willing to read it. The story itself I want to come off as a story of self discovery. I plan to slowly have the world expand as the main character, Build-a, comes to grow and learn as a being. I am also working on writing up all the lore (even if we won't fully go into it), and keeping myself doing it by making a patreon reward based on it. (If desired I will privately send you a link to these documents so you can do a full review- just be careful of spoilers please!)\nThomas the Artist (the husband!)- He has the hard job of making this come to life (insert arguments about character design here that he's normally right about), and works off the scripts I provide. We both agree he has been really improving since he started. He does take some artistic liberties by giving Build-a facial expressions (Seriously sassy build-a is sassy), but we think it really helps convey what she is thinking. He feels he needs to work on getting character designs more solidified and getting to where he can draw the complex characters and backgrounds more easily. Finally he is working on improving the shadow and lighting effects- which is he doing slowly to keep here from being a jarring difference and make sure he can do it right.\nI'd also like to note he is a graphic designer for a living.\nWe having been around long, and we did do a couple filler bits when real life stuff came up... and I'll admit we set up some shirt designs in my husbands online store to try and support the dream goal.\nTarget audience: Ummm... we never decided but it should be fine for teens and up.

I'm only just moving into plot stuff on my main site,1 and tapas is a fair bit behind that so that I can have a buffer on here.\nThis comic was intended as a way of fooling around with story telling and comic formatting, by not using panels and trying to make it feel like the characters live in the space they are in (works better on my main site where I have more control of the layout). I basically am hoping to make something for people who like cute, silly, dark and mysterious stuff cause it's a weird mix that I've enjoyed in other places before.

I've had these story ideas in my head in a while and I'd like to get them out of my head. I want to prove to myself that I can commit to long term projects. I've also loved storytelling since I was a kid, but I've never fully put them out online for others to see and talk about.

Occasionally dark but always pretty goofy throughout. \nIntentions: I'm a full time cartoonist who is working on a lot of different projects for different publishers and freelancing. My intention with this comic was to try and do a quick daily improvisational comic where I drew and posted four pages every week day that I was originally ONLY publishing on Instagram (here1). I really just wanted to see if I can do an alright looking side project that anybody would be interested in while working on my main stuff. The fact that its being improvised daily isn't actually stated at all and early on people were trying to look for clues themselves in places where there weren't any clues because I had no idea what was going on yet.\n Because of the frequency I was posting it at, the comic ended up gaining a following I was not expecting. Two weeks ago I decided to try a monthly pay what you want/free subscription model on Gumroad to see if I could make a little money on it while I was working on it and I've scaled back to 8-12 pages a week as opposed to 20 because my workload has recently increased but so far its at around 800 subscribers on Gumroad with more people still only following it on Insta. Because it was improvisational there are a couple typos early on and some weird timing discrepancies.

Hard to say about the target audience. Probably people in teens and 20s, I expect mostly women, but who knows. I would rank myself as a mediocre comic. Honestly, I am a bit dissapointed with myself as I feel like there are quite a few things I could improve and I feel like my dialogue is lacking. English isn't my first language, but I do not think that is actually the main problem. Also gestures and expressions are a bit of a struggle, too. Sometimes I feel like I can imagine it in my head, but I have trouble putting it on paper. I hope this will improve as I gain experience somewhat. At the place where I am now in the story, I slowly, but steadily lose subscribers, maybe that I got stuck at this one plot for a little too long and it takes time between updates. I wonder if it will get better as the story continues or not. Art-wise, I think it can be considered average. I do mistakes, but partly because I only want to spend a reasonable time with each panel and I am reluctant to go back and edit details.\n\nMost of all however, I really enjoy creating it right now and I am eager to tell this story. I would, however, love for the people to enjoy it, too, and I feel like there is a lot of room for improvement, and I could definitely use some guidance.

I don't have many expectations, though I am making it in a way that makes it easier to print so I can sell it at comic cons. My intention is really to get better at comics and tell an engaging story.My target audience is all over the place, I used to think it would be roughly people in late teens since most people who read webcomics are fairly young but when I'm selling at cons it seems to be bought by both genders fairly equally aged between about 20 and 60, which is a wide target audience. It's difficult to tell the difference in demographics online. It's not a kid's comic so definitely people above 15.I'd say my comic is fairly amateur, though the art and writing is improving (I think) it was rough at the beginning. I feel like I haven't become quicker but I am doing more detail and more panels per page now. I'd really like to be able to create at a professional level, I still struggle with getting characters to look consistent, drawing actions, and making convincing dialogue.

My initial thought was ""What the hell do I have to say to this person, they\'re crushing it.""\nThat sentiment aside, I do think I have a few important notes to make. It\'s a massive project, having gone on for 4 years now, so I freely admit that I did not in fact read all of it. I read up to the end of Chapter 10 and picked up again at Chapter 19 up to today. I browsed chapters in between. Bear that in mind, because I\'m going to act like I read most if not all of it. You will know whether or not I have any idea what the hell I\'m talking about. It\'s a long story, after all.\nThis will be a nitpicky review. You\'re obviously in the top percentile of successful creators, both in objective skill and raw numbers--this is compared to the rest of us shmucks. Any serious gripes I have are 100 purely a matter of specific personal taste.\nGoals and Intentions:I had the interesting experience of reading your intentions, reading your comic having forgotten them, and then rereading them--I had conflicting feelings. The most obvious one--which you mentioned in your goals already--is that your comic oozes ""Epic Fantasy Adventure Across Vast Drama-Filled World"" despite your admitted interest in the personal relationships between Ethan, Dan, and Lushaka. The interesting thing is that your comic also screams sexual tension drama. The bottom line is that you succeed in both streams of genre, but both forces are so powerful that they rub up against each other in both effective and unfortunate ways. We\'ll go into this in a moment. It\'s mainly a writing problem, I think.\nArt:Subjectively, I\'m not a fan at all. It\'s a far cry from my tastes. There, we got that meaningless, useless idea out of the way. What may not be meaningless is that unless you\'ve been going back and refining past pages as you go, I cannot see any improvement or progress at all in your artistic skill in the past 4 years. Quality remains static. Now that\'s not necessarily a problem for the reader, but I would offer that for your own digestion.\nObjectively, it\'s enchanting. When I first went through your work, i was building an argument in my head about how messy and smudgy the color was and how careless the oriental calligraphic linework was. Notably, I forgot that criticism by the time I was finished. I recognized after a while that you were emulating elements of East Asian watercolors and painting, but even more specifically, I think I tapped into the subtle deliberation you have throughout the story. You sacrifice precision for flow, which ultimately works well to make a pleasing, soft, lilting character for your work. I do wonder if you couldn\'t afford some finer lines, especially for many of the hands. Page 1 of Chapter 25 comes to mind--Ethan\'s hands look rushed as hell. Nitpicky, I told you. You have the fundamentals.\nBy far--by a possibly problematic long shot--your environments steal the show. Just look at the entirety of Chapter 24. It\'s drop dead gorgeous. This, I think, was the kind of thing that made me quickly forget any complaint I may have had about color. What a triumph, seriously. They look more magical and have more otherworldly beauty than your druidic magic, and that\'s saying something. I have nothing to say about them other than sing their praises. I was going to point some out specifically, but they\'re in pretty much every chapter. Gorgeous. I\'ll be using your stuff as reference, guaranteed.\nThis brings me to my one big issue, and this is simultaneously irrelevant--due to my tastes and your audience\'s response--and perhaps critically important: your character design is shockingly dull and your expressions are lackluster. We\'ll start with the latter. Maybe this is simply the convention of the manga-like look, but I was dumbfounded by how uninspired I was by your choice of character look. There are two faces to this--firstly, the baby-face reigns supreme. Virtually every character looks prepubescent. Even some of the older characters looks 30 years younger than I\'d expect. Even the most recent page--the older motherly woman. The only thing suggesting that she isn\'t in her teens is that she has those age lines under her eyes. That and facial hair are the only markers on most characters that they aren\'t just entering college.\nEthan is the worst transgressor here, and it MUST be intentional, because he looks like he has an infant\'s face grafted onto that of Joseph Joestar. This eternal youth deflates a lot of drama. I feel emotionally manipulated when I have to watch 17 year old Danbi give me the millionth sad 4 year old puppy look. It lost effectiveness by Chapter 3. In fact, all 3 of the main cast have this problem. Their bodies and ages tell me one thing, but their faces tell me another. I would seriously reflect on whether or not you\'re using their soft, young, innocent faces as a crutch for your intentions of making an emotional journey. The character design in general is, again, lackluster. The chimeric characters look preposterous in their human forms. It looks like they wear clown shoes. And because everyone looks young, it\'s hard to take any of them seriously until they\'re fighting in your visually appealing but often inscrutable action scenes. \nThis exacerbates the expressiveness problem. I went back to look through recent chapters, and I was hard pressed to find more than a few expressions that weren\'t either general unease or minor shock. One or two reassuring smiles make their way in there, but it\'s largely just melodramatic pensiveness. This extends into most other chapters. The early chapters have some variance, but that\'s waning, from the looks of things. The emotional stakes are being warped into soap opera shenanigans with this small spectrum of emotion. It\'s hard to engage with the characters--especially God damn Danbi--when they quiver their lips at me or stand mouth slightly agape for the hundreth time in a row. It\'s a dilution of melancholy.\nWriting:It\'s a shame, too, because you have two astoundingly effective scenes that underscore one of my favorite tropes of all time--parent-child drama. I don\'t have time to go fishing for the exact pages, but there\'s an early one where we see Ethan reflecting--for a single frame--on some time he P U N I S H E D some fool for talking about his father and had to be held back. And there\'s another scene where Ethan goes out desperately trying to find the father of some village child but ends up weeping on a rock. Lashaka comes to comfort him, and it is devastatingly poignant.\nThis became a problem. Your most recent page once more gives us a melancholy reflection-on-parents moment with Ethan, and I imagine there are more scattered throughout the story. It\'s becoming heavyhanded. The small spectrum of expression really makes this a sore point, making it seem like we are making no progress at all in the story. In fact, that\'s probably the ultimate issue here--I read more than half the story, browsed through most of the rest, and I cannot tell where they are or if they\'ve made it any closer to their vague goal of reaching the Heart of Keol. The stakes remain the same, the characters seem to be the same, they make the same uneasy or slightly surprised looks to each other while treading the same emotional ground. \nI mentioned in Goals that there\'s a clash of intention between the adventure and the emotional personal stories. When we\'re treading water, we turn to the world. The world you have, governed by these impressively beautiful animist avatars, chimeric outsiders, druidic magics, and enchanting East Asian motifs, is endlessly interesting. Fungus that clean your outhouses? Fascination. Seaweed boats? Very cool. Racial tensions? Always a good time. Danbi\'s distressed girly face? Boring. Maybe I missed it, but I also am not sure why Danbi is such a deadringer for a lady.\nThat brings up another minor curiosity. Your story, more than personal drama, is suffused with sexual tension. I was half expecting this to be a gay menage a trois in disguise. That means that the main cast has lots of chemistry and works well together, but it also means that I\'m being pulled in yet another thematic direction. There are several scenes discussing people\'s junk, their gender, sexual theory, and just a general undertoe of lewdness, especially when it comes to the chimeric characters. \nAll of this said, i do want to commend you on the general strength of the world building and story. Slow as it is, I was definitely engaged for the first chapters I read. It\'s easy for an early reader to see lots of potential. Again, though, it\'s being buried beneath an avalanche of too familiar drama and constant familiar angst. Perhaps a shake up is needed.\nSummation:Looking back, this seems a raw deal, but it\'s in part due to how well you\'re doing. A large audience of engaged readers, a polished, professional look, a truly enchanting world--you seem to have it all. I personally just can\'t manage to ignore some ostensibly out of place gaps in effort an",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 effect. Compare your environments and backgrounds to your characters, and I see a huge problem. Sadly, I wonder most about your intentions. With all the effort being placed on the emotional journey of flawed people, I can\'t help but think the potential of this moving, subtle, multi-layered adventure is being strangled by your own efforts for clarity. Has the emotional journey begun to choke the life of the story? And is it because you are worried you aren\'t be clear enough?', '@danitasibert Maximum Chaos is next'," """"Round 2\n@danitasibert  and Maximum Chaos\nThis is a unique one. I'm going to point that out now because it's the very first thought that bubbles up. You've got yourself a strange",,,, and I came up short. That's a neutral statement.\nGoals:It's hard for me to visualize exactly what you mean by this being a show in comic form--but what vestiges I can detect are extraordinarily effective. The energy of the comic is BURSTING with life. It floored me, honestly--It's a rough start because of the gratuitous amount of worldbuilding (which we will cover later)--that I was so enamored with how dynamic this was. It shows that you have studied media, for sure. It's paying off big time. Any potential gaps in art or writing skill is easily glazed over with the supremely manifest energy of storytelling.\nArt:Like everything else about this comic, it's a rocky start. It's not until Chapter 3 that the art begins to look both competent, stylish, and BASELINE polished. That's a good place to start actually: The difference in polish between the covers and their actual pages is enormous. It's amusing, actually, because I think your covers actually look much less appealing than your average page. I'd say this is in great part due to your aforementioned GLORIOUS feeling momentum and energy--that's a strength worth talking about.\nWhat is not a strength, however, is the clutter. Holy crap, dude, it is hard to read this thing--not because it's bad or awkward (quite the opposite actually), but because the formatting blows hard. It's terrible. My eyes are dragged all over the page by weird panel flow and inscrutable line work. Panels bleed into one another regularly, and they are all so cluttered and choked that I often have real trouble making out what's going on. This should be priority one for you, because this is great stuff. It would be a tragedy if you missed out because of how labyrinthine your comic is. Holy crackers, there isn't enough to be said about this problem. I think it gets MUCH better as time goes on, but it creeps in now and again, but beware of tiny, crowded panels spider-webbing across the page. The first few chapters are borderline unreadable.\nOther than that issue, I have to say that I'm sold on the style. That was a surprise to me, because any overtly anime/manga look is a turn off to me normally. I think what saves this from that is the wonderfully multifaceted emotion spectrum I see on every page. You are excellent at providing a vast array of expressions, all of them convincing and amusing, in every chapter. That does a lot of work for you, obviously, but it is no crutch. The lineart is suitable by itself, yet like every other aspect of the art is not hamstrung by any lack of polish or skill. This, once again, goes back to your dynamism. What exciting poses! What a huge number of them! How different they are! Never a dull moment for the eye, that is for certain.\nExcept for one problem I almost forgot--too many people look waaaaaay too much alike. I could not pick out half the cast from a lineup of similar looking characters. They're all Dio Brando or a character from Manly Guys doing Manly Things. Even the women blend together. I think your character design is founded on solid ground--Gabe and Marc share that garish, ostentatious 80s look, April's monstrous avatar is delightful and Madame Mobsta is, shockingly, genuinely badass. The problem is that those solid foundations often melt together into samey characters. The best example I can give you is your own banner. It's actually hilarious. But it's also a potential problem, especially when there's no color and it's a crowded cluttered comic.\nSide note: Unless I'm reading far too much into this, Madame Mobsta is a gorgon, yes? That's why we never see her eyes and why no one ever looks her in the eye, yes? If that's so, she's the crowning triumph of your work. What a cool character. I'm tempted to sub just so to see more of her, and maybe I will.\nWriting:I'll add it here for emphasis--your energy is the heart and soul of this comic. Without it, the entire work falls apart. This is apparent even in rather static panels. For exmple, my eyes glaze over on Page 6 of Chapter 16. Lifeless. Even the expressive characters cannot save it. If the writing itself were beautiful and engaging, that would be one thing. But for the most part, the dialogue ranges from suitable to amusing. I did actually chuckle several times reading through, because you do have a charming wit about every character. None of them come off as smug, sneering jerks. I engage with them all because their voices ring true. That's an enormous step up from many other comics that rely on quirky characters.\nQuirky is an understatement. Your comic is balls to the walls bizarre and for the first time in a long time, I'm down with it. Absurdist, surreal situational humor is a rough road to travel, but you've nailed it as far as I'm concerned. There's just enough baffling static to sell the preposterous play by plays and the absurd looking characters. I have to commend you on that. Even if the dialogue is little more than effective, the contextual power refines the experience dramatically. What I'm trying to say is that this is a fun ride, and I became more an d more engaged as I read. \nThe narrative itself is touch and go. You stopped dumping lore, which was a God send. It's amazing how much damage they do to your comic in the first few chapters. It clogs up the arteries, stopping the energizing flow you have. The core plot is baffling. I can't make heads or tails of anything beyond Madame Mobsta trying to steal.... something? The rest feels like an episodic cartoonish sitcom. It hops around from moment to moment, and none of it feels very connected. This could be hearkening back to your intentions of creating a show through a comic. Every segment is only loosely connected, underscoring the impatience and short attention span of the pacing and characters themselves. Something has to give, here. Is it episodic or not? I assume it's more longform, in which case it will behoove you to bring some focus to this delightful madness.\nYou've SORT OF addressed this, and it is mentioned in a few comments, but you have to do something about your text and speech bubbles. I feel a kinship with you, because I, too, have tremendous issues with that. I've recently stopped progress to go back and totally revamp the text and bubbles I have. Obviously that's harder for you, since you have way more pages than I, but you get the point no doubt. It is genuinely impractical to read quite a few pages as a result of this problem, and while they are mostly in the first half of your work, it remains an issue even now--though to a lesser degree.\nSummation:Your comic's tent-pole is its energy. I'll keep saying that until I die. Everything else is effective predominantly because your sense of action, pacing, and expressiveness leaves no room for fatigue or doldrums. It was a thrilling ride to be on, even if the beginning is exceptionally rocky. Your problems are balls and chains, and you've already shown signs of breaking free. I'm excited to see where this goes, because it's one of the few works I've seen that has become close to comparable to JoJo's Bizarre Adventures in both genre and effectiveness. It's amazing how many comics are influenced by JoJo," but you've really taken on the absurdist mantle and made yourself look DAMN good. Follow the energy and break free of all the frustrating baggage your comic has.""""", '@Rodimus13 and Hue are You next.'," """"Oh geez now I'm nervous....""""", 'Round 3\nHue are You\nIt\'s almost unfair that I know that you are a couple--that\'s emotional pressure I\'m susceptible to. It must be wonderful to be able to collaborate with your SO on something so important to both of you. It\'s romantic, to say the least. That said, it must be a minefield as well. It\'s an entire new dimension.\nGoals:I don\'t have much to say here, because you have a very relatable and straight forward journey ahead. You have a huge advantage in being a dynamic duo. That\'s mostly a matter of energy. Beyond the logistical ease of splitting up the work, it must be great to always have another conduit of energy to take advantage of. I should mention that i did not request any additional documents. As a reader, I don\'t want to go in with context that others won\'t, and I certainly don\'t have the foundational interest to seek such things out. \nFor the work itself, I can vaguely see the seeds of a vast world. I\'ll go into that more in Writing, but for now, it is important to note that the holistic experience of reading Hue are You is not yet one of discovery. That may come down to several factors I will point out in the following sections. That said, i don\'t want to give the impression of this not having potential. What I mean is that had I not know that you explicitly are hoping for a big story in a big world, I would have thought this the foundation of an episodic series.\nArt:Competent is a good start. The art is manifestly competent, and this is based in great part on how obvious it is that you\'re a graphic designer. Every character looks unique and looks exactly how they probably should look given the art style and the story\'s context. Query in particular is overwhelmingly pleasing to see in action, but every robot design is bonded perfectly to their character, personality, and thematic role. Build-A is the weakest one, here. It took a long time to figure out that she was female, or as female as a robot could be, and in general it is difficult to piece together the design connections with her personality and role. Yes, she is the product of an assembly line, but so are the others--and they all are far more engaging. It doesn\'t help that she is grey, yet her personality seems rather bubbly. She has a mild but obvious case of Safe Main Character syndrome. She is so limited in her look and so basic in her personality that she is potentially very boring. I\'ll go further in Writing, because the most recent page may prove me dead wrong.\nMentioning her grayness reminds me that I have conflicting feelings about the color in general. I love the thematic import, of course, and the partisan tension is simple and interesting. Red vs Blue tells me everything I need to know to begin enjoying the story. the color palette in general is effective, but the problem once again is that gray. It is very often difficult to make out what exactly is going on. In the most recent page, more than half of the panels took time to parse. So many grays, and so few meaningful highlights. This may be another byproduct of Build-A\'s comparatively mediocre design. She blends into every panel and has a very forgettable face. Having only white eyes in a muddy chassis is a bummer. Tricky issue, that.The rust may be your best friend her. It could be an exceptionally interesting color--and thematic element--to explore more in the future.\nNow over all, the competency of the art remains just that--competence. I can\'t say it\'s very exceptional, and in no way can I say the art stands out on any merit other than it\'s clear thoughtfulness and sleek utility. Again, it is so clear to me that you\'re a Graphic Designer. It\'s doing a ton of work for you. The graphical white noise behind the poignant wedding ring panels is P E R F E C T I O N. The text is the best I\'ve seen so far as well. Hell, the construction in general is, to me, more or less flawless. Panel flow and all, the design of the comic helps mitigate most of the issues that arise from otherwise underwhelming artstyles. \nI\'ll end this section with a personal note: I was super excited to see a comic about robots with comparably human emotional maturity but purely mechanical expression. I was disappointed in the choice to go for the emotive, quasi-human faces/eyes. I categorically prefer the clash of emotional gravitas and muted, iron expression. That said, I think Query pulls this off splendidly, and I think you should have had all of the robots have a similar screen-face motif. If anything, Query should have the expressionless Hal face and the rest of the bots have the screen-faces. But these are purely personal preferences, and are therefore completely useless.\nWriting:Much like the art, I was not particularly impressed or struck by the dialogue or core narrative. I did not find any moving or thrilling prose. That\'s all i need to really say on the problem, if it is one. It is no more and no less than sufficient. There are the oddball moments like the duo musical number that I thought were tacky and unamusing (probably for personal reasons). On the other hand, Query\'s tone statements are adorable, as is everything about her. She is, if you haven\'t figured it out, my favorite part of the comic by far. But even that can\'t save the fact that the dialogue is just trite and unengaging. it gets me to the next panel, and that\'s it. I \'m not even sure anyone other than Q is benefiting from saying ANYTHING at all. Silence could be a powerful tool for emphasizing stakes and tension, especially for robots.\nPutting all of that aside, I want to talk about plot and atmospheric narrative. You nail it, more often than not. As underwhelming as much of the comic ends up being, I found myself genuinely enthralled by what was going to happen next. The possibilities are all equally breathtakingly tragic and truly exciting. Your simple premise and doggedly consistent tonal and thematic focus give me, the reader," so much momentum. The premise is great--a unique take on the """"chosen one"""" archetype", based on utility and industry rather than abstract characteristics. I genuinely want to know what happens when more and more people become aware of Build-A\'s existence. The beauty is that her very existence shakes up the status-quo. It can be a problem when a story revolves around a character rather than the other way around, but I think you have a double orbit going on, here. The world and Build-A work seamlessly together to create an engaging powder keg of drama and tension.\nI think on its own, the premise and general narrative would be sufficient to grab interest. But I applaud you for going the extra mile and starting the intriguing subplot about Build-A\'s dreams and visions. As I mentioned above, the scene where she finds the wedding ring was heartbreaking--and it was all the more effective because I had nothing to go on but the unspoken importance of the wedding vows and the ring\'s symbolic weight. I was both emotionally fulfilled and wanting more. This is gold.\nSummation.It\'s genuinely hilarious how perfect this works out: the married duo manage to make a comic that is unremarkable until taken as a holistic experience. The sleek construction, the intelligent character design, the narrative power, and the unity of visuals and subtextual weight make this comic a surprising treat from start to finish. As you improve your artistic skills, and as you gain more material with which to make better dialogue, I am confident that you could be very successful. At the risk of sounding insufferable," the soul of your comic manages to conquer the inadequacies and mediocre elements of your work. This can only get exponentially better with time.']""",12/4/2018 16:57,https://forums.tapas.io/t/meaty-reviews-season-2-post-your-comic-get-a-meaty-review-finished/29255,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blue Life  | Tapas
Blue Life is an open universe where everything is or isn’t a coincidence or a parallel to reality, depending on the reader.
Updates whenever the Blues allows me.





","['First of all, Happy birthday! I\'m not really good at this kind of thing, but I\'ll try!\nBlue life is exactly is and exactly not what I thought it would be .\nThe humor is more subtle, a bit surreal than I thought; a refreshing thing compared to what comedy comics here mostly offers. I really like the role of mostly silent and silly Blue thing (there are many of them, are they ""Blues"" or Blue is one of them?).   They speak loud through their actions which often weird and followed by  even weirder consequences which is I think the core content of this comic. I\'m a bit surprised when they fully speak in Q&A session though.\nWhile their design is something you can draw with eyes closed, it still did good job for reader to empathize with them (at some instances, they also look kinda cute). I also like the recurring element like the alien, especially its use at inksgiving special.\nThe very simplistic art style is a match fit for this kind of content (although it can be a bit more polished), incorporating the panel and shapes to interact with Blue is clever and appropriate. The simplistic color (mostly blue, duh) also works well, especially in the True Color episode which has more colors and we encountered a yellow kind (are they same species or not with the blue? You got to explain this )\n  I just wondering is the use of Apple emoji as symbol in many parts on purpose, or just because you don\'t want to draw it? It kind of... Funny...\n For me, it\'s somehow relaxing; a light but fun weird kind of read that you wonder why you keep reading it.  It reminds of comedy content of silent movies or cartoon like Pink Panther, only this one is more odd and unusual  I started to think the real plot of this comic is waiting the giant rabbit to appear.', 'Hi Kainatama thank you so much for joining my party.I\'m surprised by the detail of you review and I gladly repay that to your work.But you forgot to leave the gift at the table \nI\'ll try here to answer some of your questions about the Blue Life universe.""Blue"" is the main character livening amount all the other ""Blues"". But I can\'t sort out which one he is.About the other colors, we have just learned about them in the newest update from the first Q&A.Yellow is rival.Read is a mystique.Purple is successful.Green is not existent, but green makes them all happy.They all live in the blue world, where blue is the dominant part.\nI must say that you nailed the core of my project and I\'m glad that you see beound the ""easy-made"" layout and pointing out some of the cleverness.\nAnd again, thank you for joining the party.\nEDIT: The use of emoji is pure laziness, but it works', 'Will do later! I’m on break', ""Happy birthday!\nI took a peek at your series, and I gotta say it's very charming. I'll comment on two episodes in particular.\nBlind Date\nI love this one. To me, it's not about sexual orientation. I read it as an allegory about goals, expectations, reality, and finding happiness through it all. \nLike, you set out to achieve a goal; you look around, and everyone else is achieving theirs. There's a pattern in how they're doing it (finding a girl), giving the impression that if you don't follow that pattern, you're not successful. Then one day, you find success -- your version of it, one that matches the effort you've been putting in -- but it doesn't match everyone else's. Do you reject it because it's different from everyone else's success? Or do you embrace it?\nBlue ends up embracing it and finding happiness, and I hope I can find and embrace my own success some day, too.  \nBanana\nWhile I enjoyed the humor in this one, I do have a suggestion: consider tilting parts of your art sometimes? \nYou already use tilt with the arms. In the last panel when the character is dodging the carrot, the arms are tilted to depict a specific body language. I feel you could do more with tilt; the body, the legs, the props. Tilting the carrot, for example, could capture the sense of falling/hitting the floor instead of just laying on the floor. Perhaps tilting the legs could better show the impromptu dodging.\nYou use the simple art style well already. I feel there's more you can do while keeping the simple style, to take it to the next level! Best of luck! (and also subbed!) \n\nHere's my comic2. You don't really have to review it, since mine is a longform story and hard to read & review a random episode without all the context."", ""Thank you so much for being part of my party. I embrace all your content and that you use my comic to set your own point of view. This is what Blue Life also is made for. To read and enjoy the plots in different ways.\nI agree that sometimes the angle and expressions isn't always as sharps as they should be. But I guess that the frames and possessions also can be viewed different in this art form. In my imagenation I didn't see the banana suppeise as you do. But now knowing it, i see it and will reconsider how I want it to be. Thank you for the feedback.\nI will as promised take a look at your gift, and I shall leave a review if I have useful context to delver.\nThank you so much for loving Blue Life"", 'And thank you for the suppeise Ink !!!!Soon the Alien Save can be open then...', 'Banana has been updated. Thank you for the advice.', 'I took a look at you comic. And it will take me some time and great effort that I might not posses to review.I just leave this here to show you how detailed I understand your work is.\nYOU HAVE MY FULL RESPECT (Subed too)\nUdklip.PNG260x553 74 KB\n', 'Aw, thank you!

I feel a sense of fun and interest I haven't felt since reading Triangle and Robert when I was a Teen (I am Oooooooold). I like how to plays with the context and fourth wall, and how it continues to make sense in its own fun way."", 'I’m glad that my comic gives you joy.Thank you so much for joining my party and take the time to read and review.\nIf you like, then post your work, and I gladly take a look at it.', ""Ok, you did look at it though!\n\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nHue Are You? :: Fade to White | Tapas\nThe prologue to our story, and how it almost didn't begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'And I love it.

476,Concept Feedback for your Writing,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey there guys, so I wanted to start a thread where we could get good feedback around concepts and ideas we might have that aren't quite ironed out yet.
First: Give us a quick summary of the story and setting, and any important information that might effect the new concept.
Second: Tell us what themes your story aims to play off of. i/e Romance, Revenge, Good vs Evil, Humor, ect
Third: Pitch to us the concept you are working on, and include any issues you're having pertaining to the concept.
Fourth: Hopefully we can give satisfactory feedback for you!","[""Since I created the thread, I figured I should probably go ahead and post myself.\nSummary: ‘Lost Guardians’ is the story of an enslaved people, the Anithos, who are rallied into action by the appearance of the legendary Guardians. Brutal conflicts between humans and the Anithos clans take roots in religion and prejudice. Galleon is a callous Draken Clan Anithos, whose deep hatred of humans draws him to walk a fine line between revenge and justice. \nThemes: Dark Fantasy, Action/Adventure, and Drama with the story focusing on Revenge, Prejudice, and Good vs. Evil \nConcept Pitch: I am attempting to come up with convincing religions for the comic and these are the ideas I have so far, but I would love some feedback on these as I'm not well versed in this area. This this is fairly adult, and intended for mature audiences.\nIyanismHoly man: Iyanisan Priest The holy book: the GolbidA relatively young religion that most humans now follow, it was originally less bias toward the Anithos clans, but has had more prejudice interpretations by its priests in more recent times. It worships the one true god named Irial (known as Homosia in Kanahilli), and teaches that those closest to Irial’s form, which is said to look human, are the purest and worthiest mortals. Anithos are believed to be corruptions of the pure human form, and the Golbid teaches Godly salvation favors only the pure.Practices: Some of their religious practices include flogging sinners, sacrificing the impure (Anithos), and blood rituals. The most common blood ritual was derived from an incident involving the brutal rape of an Anithos woman by a gang of human men. Where after, the men went home to their wives and spawned their own children. It was seen afterwards as a form of fertility luck to bless an impure Anithos woman with the “seed of the pure”. After she is bred, her blood must be consumed and the men must copulate with their own human wives within a period. The consuming of blood is symbolic of Irial consuming the impure and returning purity and balance to the world. The church buys a large percentage of female Anithos from slavers as they are less desired as workers, and are often cheap. It is also seen as a sign of good faith to donate a female slave for ritual. \nKanahiliHoly man: Kanahilist Sol PriestThe holy book: The ShairraThe most prevalent religion amongst Anithos clans, although it has some differences from clan to clan, the base beliefs are the same. It has a belief in three Gods, and believes the Anithos people derived from one of these gods breeding with human women. It also believes in the profit of five demi-gods predicted to descend to their people in times of great need. Practices: Some of their religious practices include self-flagellation when one has wronged the Gods, prophecy, drug-induced spiritual trances, and, in some clans, cannibalism of the deceased. \nRodaiismHoly man: Rodaiist ShamanThe holy book: None; Verbal TeachingsA lesser practiced religion that encourages emotional mastery and self-awareness, and worships the spirits of the world rather than gods or deities. The Wandering Mountain Gods are also seen as part of these worldly spirits. Practicing Rodaiism openly can, however, bring persecution from the more common religions, despite It’s teaches of enlightenment through virtue.Practices: Though the devout often travel as nomadic groups, the monks often practice a period of nomadic travels alone to take in the world and contemplate upon how to better it, as well as offer aid to those in need. Meditation, martial arts, and acceptance of all peoples are among the fundamental teachings.\nJohonatoHoly man: Johonatan Shaman The holy book: The KirrairA religion only practiced by the Lepuro Anithos clan. It takes some bits from Kanahili, but rather than the descent of the five demigods as saviors, the Lepuro believe the five to be evil, foretold to descend in a time of weakness in order to precede the apocalypse for all men. It is a religion seeped in fear and separatism.Practices: In order to ward off the prophecy, sacrifices are made every so often to sate the five’s bloodlust. Blood rituals are also regularly practiced as a means to show strength.\nI'd love feed back with these. I've never written religion much in my other stories, so this is going to be a first.\nAlso just for shits, here's Galleon's character sheet\ngalleon character sheet.jpg1200x927 297 KB\n"", ""If you are simply asking if these religions are believable enough for a fantasy setting, the simple answer is yes.\nAre they interesting enough that they add to the story? Not particularly.\nReligions exist in order to provide answers to big questions. Why do we exist? Where does the rain come from? Where do people go when they die? Why do bad things happen to good people? How do I cope with misery and suffering? In our world, different religions focus on different questions, and no single religion answers them all well.\nQuick examples: In Star Wars, the core belief if the Force is that all things in the galaxy are connected and this connection can be used to create positive change. Darksiders believe in using the connection for selfish change. In the fantasy novel Warbreaker, one faction believes that life force and magic (which manifests as color) is sacred and it is taboo for mortals to mess with it. The other faction decided to mess with it and infuse enough of it into specific individuals to create their own gods. Cthulhu Cults believe that powerful monsters hidden from the world will inevitably destroy the world at any moment, so we might as well cash in now and borrow as much of their power as we can before it's lights out. In these four quick examples, all of their beliefs are factual which is a valid choice in a fantasy story, but it would be equally valid if some of them got it wrong.\nThese religions in your description make no attempts to answer anything. You provided a lot of information, but maybe it was the wrong info. You wrote at length about religious practices but very little about the beliefs. What is the core belief of each of these religions? Did any of them develop as a reaction to some need or circumstance in this world?"", ""So, I think an interesting way to give religion one more depth is to have it so that the head priest of the religion has actually taken a phrase from whatever holy book it is that they worship and twisted it into saying what he wants it to say--that humans are pure and antihos are not--when in reality, it says something a lot vaguer that could have multiple interpretations. for example, the holy book can say, 'and humans, who are the purest creatures on earth...' etc.\nI think another thing to make it more interesting would be to have human sympathizers to the Antihos who have a different interpretation of what their holy book says. Maybe they have interpreted the holy book as saying that Antihos and humans are equal via a different phrase in the holy book and they can protest the harsh treatment of Antihos--but they also get arrested for it and even antihos themselves spit on these human sympathizers so we can see that Antihos aren't perfect people, either. I think this would make it a little more three-dimensional.\nI don't know how advanced these cultures are, but I tend to think more primitive cultures would have a pretty simple religion like religion one (encouraging fear and submission), whereas more advanced cultures would have a more enlightened view of religion which encourages love and acceptance. Just something to keep in mind while creating.\nI also think @Zaboem brought up an important point about the belief system which is why I think it's a good idea to establish a holy book with different teachings for each religion. Unless, like I said, the culture is more primitive and the religion is mostly taught orally.\nI think you've got a pretty neat concept here and your design and style is gorgeous! I wish you luck!"", ""If anyone wants to take a stab at this short story I have in the works, it would be greatly appreciated faints\nSummary: 'Almost Human' is a story about a robot who has protected humanity from Nightmares lurking in the sky who come down and attack humans. If it isn't obvious, Nightmares are just bad dreams personified into a creepy, huge, batlike creatures who come down from the sky and attack humans once a week. However, our main robot character, Legacy, is burnt out and is doing his job very clumsily as of late. Where once he could fight off Nightmares with no problems at all, he is now consistently getting his arms and legs blown off in battle. He thinks he is malfunctioning at first, both because he has had a perception of feeling as of late (which is impossible for robots in this world), and because he has been performing his duty so poorly. When his mechanist, Kiria, tells him he is in optimal condition and suggests that he may be complex enough to have grown emotions, she suggests that he see a therapist instead to see if they can help him parse out why he isn't performing his duty as well.\nThemes: What makes a human, human?, relationships between beings and their creators, what's the meaning of life?, free will, and parallels between abuse situations.\nConcept pitch: So, in the story, there are of course going to be other characters who Legacy plays off of. Buuuut I'm sort of having trouble deciding whether I just want to focus on his relationship with one other character in the story, or two others. I have this idea of him either being in a romantic relationship in the past, OR, being in a sibling relationship in the past, but I'm afraid doing both might be a little much for a short story. So, I really just wanted to ask y'all whether you think it would fit the story more to have a romantic relationship or a sibling relationship, or should I live life on the wild side and try to do both?\nAny input you have is greatly appreciated since I'm only about two pages into the story right now! Feel free to make story suggestions, too! If you need any clarifications I'd be glad to clear them up for you, also."", ""Thanks a lot! Appreciate the feedback. It's a good idea to add in the holy books for sure. My original concept on the first religion was that a holy man was trying to create peace between the races but an Anithos kills him and it sparks an outrage that sweeps through the country, and creates the original conflict between the races, which has just had a snowball effect since then. Perhaps I can write in about another priest twisting the interpretation and it gaining popularity after the first priest is killed.\nMuch thanks for the feedback!"", ""Maybe I am misunderstanding something, but if the robot is developing emotions for the first time during the story, then a previous romance in its backstory doesn't fit well. In a sibling relationship, emotions are optional. I am guessing that the relationship is between the robot and the mechanic, so a sibling relationship there might be feasible, and it would fit well into the space of a short story. Maybe I am wrong and we are talking about two robots in a sibling relationship. If that is the case, we are talking about adding probably a couple of extra scenes in which the robots talk, and now the short story has become a novella."", ""You should probably ask yourself, is the past relationship is going to effect the present relationship? If so how? Also how will it effect him as a character? You should probably also think about how vague or detailed you want to get with the past. \nIf he's had a past romantic relationship, you could either use it to create doubt or despair in the character, as he is perhaps still effected by the lost love, or perhaps even longing to feel love again. \nIf the relationship is more platonic or familial, perhaps you could use it to illustrate the differences in his relationship with the present characters, assuming that the current relationship is romantic."", ""I'm really glad to be of some help and your original concept sounds super cool~!"", ""I think you just solved my problem! For some reason, I was thinking I should only pertain these relationships to the past, but now that you mention it, it's a really good idea to have one going in the present, too! Thanks for the input~!"", 'Thanks much  Glad I could help you out as well.']",12/30/2018 23:18,https://forums.tapas.io/t/concept-feedback-for-your-writing/30047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your coloring technique gives it additional sharm.But there is the thing about your art, which confuses me sometimes: many of your characters look too similar to each other, at least, from my opinion. Sometimes it is hard to determine their sex, because girls look alike the boys. I'd suggest to add more details to their designs, so they would look more diverse and distinguishable.

Some letterings look good, but another ones are hard to read. The thing you surely can do to improve your comics is to re-check all dialogues, texts etc and make them as readable as possible; also I've already suggested  somewhere to add clear and readable translation to english everywhere where it is needed.\nI hope that this was helpful!

482,Offering critique! (illustrations preferably bc time is rare uwu),Reviews | Feedback,[],"hello! I'm Lia
I've been an artstudent for two years, and while my uni is garbage and I'm switching to a design program, it still taught me a lot about critiquing. 
I am an overthinker which helps me think of all sorts of possibilities to do stuff. and I have binged tons worth of tutorials and have been asked to help critique stuff in my circle of friends a lot... plus I've got years of teaching experience as a tutor. 
So if you want an extensive critique to your Art or Comic then hmu here! 
but a disclaimer:   after I've given a critique, please think for yourself if you agree or not. I can always be wrong and even if I'm practised in objectivity, there's still always some bias and taste involved

","['All I can generally say is:1. the thumbnail is not inviting enough. The thumbnail decides a lot on Webtoons. Maybe experiment with a few other, coloured versions and check your views.2. Webtoon readers highly prefer coloured webtoons. Doesn´t mean uncoloured doesn´t work. But it´s def harder3. The Blurb is very negative - and also doesn´t tell you anything you can expect from the story - or makes you want to read the story.4. The first episode starts with text - and there´s so much text. This is your primer, the first taste your new potential reader gets of the story. There´s no reason so far they´d willingly work themselves trough paragraphs upon text.\nHope that helps  English isn´t my first language either, that shouldn´t matter too much, but keep improving and run some checks over blurb etc (free program would be grammarly)', ""thanx  yea (The Blurb) I really don't like it i'm trying to figure out something catchy, about the color version it'll take a hell of a time besides i'm still not that good in digital coloring....and about the intro i made it as a cinematic intro you know narrated by Morgan freeman voice "", 'hm, for the blurb you could describe the starting version for your main characters and the main struggels they will have to overcome. Or an self insert ""What would you do if you were (in the situation your webtoon puts it´s characters in).I understand the opener, there´s a strong impulse to make comics like movies (Morgan freeman aka it would work well as a movie), but you sometimes can´t translate it that directly. If you experiment with blurb and thumbnail tough I´m sure more people will at least give it a try ', 'An extraterrestrial Life Form crashed on inhabitant land with an unknown parasite.... That when Man decided to play God... It is a battle between Them and Us...\nMore General and mysterious ', 'definitely better than before ;D !', ""yay  well now I'll start to fix those thumbs thanx for your help "", '\n\noushachan:\nand about the intro i made it as a cinematic intro you know narrated by Morgan freeman voice \nWhile reading it, I don\'t mind this approach personally. But as the OP asks why you\'re not gaining popularity - you need to keep in mind you\'re posting as a comic, not a novel. While yes, you can do this paragraph format and it can fit what style you enjoy, the fact is your first episode is what hooks new readers and gets them to keep reading. They\'re opening your comic expecting a comic - but that first while of scrolling is blocky paragraphs. \nIf you want to keep this approach however, I recommend trying to trim it down a bit. There\'s also an over use of the word ""galaxy/galaxies"" that make it kind of stiff to read. The program Prowritingaid has a free trail that lets you test smaller word counts and might be helpful for analyzing these paragraphs for repetition and readability.\nWith the comparison that your format in the beginning is more Telling than Showing the reader this is another example:\nimage.png644x530 204 KB\nthis part could have had the owner saying these things in  speech bubble, to make it more like reading a comic than a picture book. However, personally I think it works since it gives a news coverage feel to the beginning of the story. But I\'m also on the fence, cause I know the standard rule to catch readers is to ""Show Don\'t Tell."" \nI realise this style is probably intentional, but as you\'re asking why it\'s not popular - to be blunt these might be reasons why. This style of narrative isn\'t bad, it\'s just not as preferred by the general audience. So if you\'re worried about gaining popularity, these are things to consider.\nFrom the OP to checking it out now, it seems you\'ve changed the thumbnail and blurb. I think you\'ve made good improvements to both of these ', 'thanx  for you detailed replay and yea you right but why this style worked here in my other webtoon it is so weird... i\'ll try to change it and thanx again \n\nwebtoons.com3\n\n\n\nThe Edge ( The Dark Side )\nWhere there is light, there is also Darkness...\na journey to find a place known as the  "" Edge "" where the truth is out there...\n\n\n\n\n\n']",12/8/2018 9:33,https://forums.tapas.io/t/this-was-manga-and-i-converted-into-a-webtoon-i-need-to-know-whats-wrong/29508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Establish the plot first and make the readers know which directiom the story faces.2. Use pauses like character in panel without dialogues. Just actions. In this way, you satisfy the first suggestion by giving readers the clue of what is next to come.3. Avoid immediate slurs, especially if it\'s from the protagonist. Just make it neutral.4. Smoothen it by aligning the panel vertically. That is the most basic, if it is.going to be webtoon.5. Establish reader connection.

Oddly Vanilla :: Sight Seers | Tapas
We’re in uncharted territory here at the Oddly Vanilla offices as we head into our second year. We’re looking to try some new formats (like this episodes infinite canvas format), new genres (like next weeks, crime noir) and a new box of crayons (we...





","['Okie Dokie then.\nThe first thing that jumps to mind, the second I opened the link, is the coloring. Bright green background contrasted with a harsh black, behind a character wearing strong red, yellow, on purple? It seriously hurt my eyes haha. There seems to be little to no consideration to how the colors mix together, the background behind almost always a completely solid background detaches me from the story giving it a “happening in a box” vibe.This continues to seriously hurt your fantastic lines in the next few panels where there’s a super detailed front and then the background is plain blue and green (both of which are... painfully saturated kiddie-crayon choices). \nThis doesn’t happen at all during the next chapters which suggests it was a conscious decision which i just don’t understand?\nThe visuals change pretty dramatically from story to story so I feel like specific advice is useless (though I had to say something about the colors). Something that persisted throughout was the lettering was a bit off- Different sized textDifferent sized speech bubbles to text (different margin/gutter space from the end of the text to the end of the bubble- sometimes the text even went outside the bubble??) Unreadable fonts Huge text (some people prefer this but to me it felt..way too big).\nWhen it comes to the stories themselves they all felt like something I’d read in western comics 30 years ago. Introduction, short buildup, twist-and-end. I realize it’s hard to make short stories that don’t fit to that template, but for me, I care for it so little it was difficult for me to get through just 3 stories.There’s a reason almost all comics on Tapas are long-running plot centric stories, or short 4koma style stories. We can get the same satisfaction from 4 panels as we can from 4 pages and most people prefer that, giving their long term attention to characters they can feel for and plot lines long and developed enough to theorize on.For me, if I know exactly what to expect, there’s nothing propelling me to continue reading the comic. \nI feel like your comics are good, they’re just not presented to the correct audience. I can’t tell you where exaclty the correct audience is since- I’m not it. But I’ve seen sites like Reddit and groups like Comic Jam circle a much more similar baseline to yours.', 'im afraid i cant take the time to crit your actual work rn, but i can give you some more business-minded tips:\nmost of these deserve their own individual series.\nanthology series dont do great on tapas because people will subscribe for one story, and then be disinterested in the rest, resulting in dead weight subscribers. and new subscribers wont be able to so easily find the story that meets their interests.\nhowever, short stories are really powerful on tapas stats-wise - the newer a series is, the better its chances to get into trending. trending is based on the ratio of subscribers and engagement (and smth abt the rate of subscription i spose?) - so if you kick off a series and immediately you have even just 20 ppl coming from ur old series, liking and subscribing, youll skyrocket to trending. the older and longer a series gets, the harder it is to get that boost.\nif you took your stories from this anthology that are longer than three updates (or honestly, you could divide these updates into smth shorter and do this with most of your stories) and turned each into an individual series with individual subscribers you could develop a really strong model with subscribers hopping from story to story. you would lose some with each hop, but losing subscribers is always preferred over dead subscribers.\nalso, yeah, seconding @kip your colourist needs to get a grip on colour theory and values. they seem kinda scared of dark colours.', ""\n\nkip:\nI feel like your comics are good, they’re just not presented to the correct audience.

You get, say, 50 subscribers for that story before it concludes and then you start uploading story B. Since story B is it\'s own unique thing that\'s not tied to A, chances are some of those 50 people wont be interested in it and stop reading. Those people may be interested in story C eventually, but chances are they wont look back at the series after dropping off at story B. Further, if they simply stop reading instead of unsubscribing, they turn into ""dead subs"" which is hurtful for the algorithm gains that @punkarsenic mentioned.\nThus, it\'s often better to upload them individually so that each story stands alone as its own thing, with its own subscriber base, and it\'s easy for newcomers to sample the different stories to find what they want/like.\n(note: I don\'t have experience with this personally, but it makes sense as it was explained to me xD)', '\n\nskicoak:\nby breaking the long series into individual short series it would ""trick"" the algorithms into those potentially being in trending more.

I really love the colors and the art overall and the story is interesting so far.\nI don't really have much I'd critique at this point. The action generally makes sense and is easy to follow. I guess at the very beginning some things seemed kind of glossed over but I suspect you're planning to come back to that. Like I know if when I was a kid someone found a mysterious kid in a bag it would have been the mystery of the danged century."", ""I feel like you have achieved your drawing skills in the academic way.Since you're not a beginner and your comic isn't low quality, I will try my best with my constructive criticism. \nYour art style is good, I have nothing to say about it.  \nAbout the color, the way you use your color pencil isn't bad, good for key artwork but isn't good enough to be used in your comic. The greatest strength in traditional drawing and painting is paper and pen (brush/ink/charcoal/...) textures, you kind of ignore it (not all) while coloring your artwork and comic.\nSuggestion: Change the medium, use Copic marker, or Arcrylic, or Water color instead.\nAbout the comic layout, your art details is kind of overdone at some point. You don't have to draw background in every panel. You should only use the background when you need to tell readers where is your character right now. Your background and foreground aren't separated, you should do something to separate your character and backround.\nSuggestion: reduce your background detail and add some highlight around your character.\nAbout the storyline and character, I'm not from the western country and none of anything in your comic happened to me, beside the depression, so it's hard for me to feel related, that's why I can't give you any detail criticism about the storyline. But based on story construction, I think your comic is good in the way it is, but would be hard to attract more readers.\nI don't know if you're trying to be professional or not, 122 pages for 3 years isn't a good way to sell your comic. So I'm not comment on how to attract viewers.\nThat's all, I hope my comment can help you at something. "", ""Hi there! I've read first 30 pages and liked it.

I was unsure about this but since I can\'t related to any of their characters, so I avoided to mention this problem.\nHere\'s my criticism about the storyline:\nI think this comic would work better with about 20 pages per chapter instead of 40 pages. Each chapter has to be something to be concluded. But what I got after read a chapter is, ""they are miserable"". And what did they do? They did nothing or even trying to resolve their problem. Drama is there to be resolved by the character, even when they failed to do so. In this comic, nothing is resolved in the first 3 chapter.\nSuggestion: Only do this type of storyline if you don\'t care about your viewcount.\nBut hey, I could be wrong, don\'t worry much about my criticism.I mean, you have a lot of views and subscribers. So feel free to ignore everything I said. ', ""Wow, I got more feedback than expected.\n@kytri, thank you for reading! More about how the character will be coming up as the story goes, although admittedly not a whole lot will be blatantly explained about that part since it doesn't have much to do with the long-term relationship of the two main characters. Although that part, along with a few things that happened before, will be eluded to and shown visually via old newspapers and such.  Julian will even talk to an older lady at some point who used to live in the same state they were found in, and remembered the event. (hopefully I'll successfully get the point across. Lol!)  The lack of info is also kind based on the character as well, Julian is very tight-lipped about their history for reasons that will come up... eventually.But you are right, I'll flat out say a mysterious kid showing up half-dead in a burlap sack was a big thing for a while, but the hype died out since it was canonically 17-18 years ago.\n@Draconic Thank you for checking out my comic! I have tried out playing with hatching to make different textures, but I admit to forgetting after a while, and they never translate very well during the scanning process.  Changing mediums has been something I've thought about, but I mainly use color pencils because I can't afford the other options.  Paints, and especially Copics are crazy expensive compared to cheapy pencils unfortunately. ;v;  Do you have any techniques you can suggest to give off a textured look with pencils?\nAbout the overdetail, do you mind showing an example? Possibly from chapter 3? I have gotten this critique for previous chapters, and I've been trying to fix it in the latest one, using light browns or not even reinking backgrounds.  The comic was partially intended to help me improve my background, perspective and architecture drawing skills, so I've been trying to keep to that while chilling out a bit.  Although I'm aware I could still be having this issue.\n\n\nDraconic:\nI don't know if you're trying to be professional or not, 122 pages for 3 years isn't a good way to sell your comic. So I'm not comment on how to attract viewers.\nLol I announced the page count to warn people that the comic is kinda long... not to brag about it or anything.  This is definitely not intended to be professional, it's just a hobby project I do whenever I'm not at work or doing house chores.\n@tired_programmer and @Draconic Not to make excuses, but the slower pace is intentional.  The comic is a slow-burn, and more character driven.  Just to warn you, it is meant to be an extremely angsty, overly depressive comic.  More to study how these characters became the way they are, and what they intend to do upon recognizing their destructive behavior before something worse happens (Particularly with the main-main character, since the other one is not mentally able), rather than be action packed.  I guess you can say it's kind of like a character study comic, but less intelligent, if that makes sense.\nI will ask, is the pace so far so slow that it hinders anything?I have been having trouble figuring out a way to incorporate visual character details while having a decent pace, there's a lot I want to pack into this comic, and want everything to have a purpose either character development wise or plot wise.  Although it's been hard finding that balance between too much, and not enough.  Do you all have any suggestions for this?\nAlso to answer your final suggestion, Darconic.  Given my comic is super niche to begin with, I don't really care about views to be honest. xD I made this as an outlet for my own depression and anxiety, and the request for criticism is meant to help me improve for myself rather than as a thing I can do to get more attention.\n\nI'm so sorry if I come off as whiny, or making excuses.  I just want to explain what I'm trying to accomplish with this project for better clarification.  I really do want to do the best I can with this comic, especially since I personally don't have a lot of experience with some of the subject matters.Also I'm sorry for the text wall, I do that when talking about something that interests me.  Either way I'm super grateful for you all taking the time to look through my comic, and giving me your feedback, it really means a lot!"", '\n\nDaniBoy:\nAbout the overdetail, do you mind showing an example?

The comic was partially intended to help me improve my background, perspective and architecture drawing skills, so I\'ve been trying to keep to that while chilling out a bit.  Although I\'m aware I could still be having this issue.\nYou can keep all the detail as you want, but you need to add some focus point with dark-light into the panel to ease reader\'s eyes, and use the digital font if you can spent more time.\nThat\'s why I suggess you should change the medium, colored pencils are kind of hard to create a good dynamic dark-light area, and too many colored layers would create a mess. The liquid permeation of the painting paper will create better textures and tones for your dark tone artwork. Or you can use your colored pencils on black paper if you want to learn a new drawing technique, better dynamic but required higher skill.\nHere\'s my example:\n\nfix daniboy.png640x872 860 KB\n\nI didn\'t spend much time on this, but I hope you will understand what I was trying to say. \n\n\nDaniBoy:\nI will ask, is the pace so far so slow that it hinders anything?I have been having trouble figuring out a way to incorporate visual character details while having a decent pace, there\'s a lot I want to pack into this comic, and want everything to have a purpose either character development wise or plot wise.  Although it\'s been hard finding that balance between too much, and not enough.  Do you all have any suggestions for this?\nIs that details would help to build up anything?The point of story is to focusing and screening the important moments to the plot, and good moments to help the reader understand your characters. For example, if a conversation or an interaction does not serve any purpose beside ""they have met"", remove it. This is the kind of knowledge that can not be taught, but the experience and awareness itself. Just trying to pay attention to your story detail and study more, you will know it better.', ""Honestly I like the colored pencils? They have a sort of grit to them that I think matches a gritty story.\nI can see the issue with characters not always standing out as well from backgrounds as they could. For me it didn't cause any huge issues but I think a good solution might be to color backgrounds in a different pallet. Lighter or less saturated or in a different color temperature. You seem to be pretty good with pallets overall.\nAlso I guess as just kind of an aside, I really could have done without Apollo using a transphobic slur near the end of the second chapter. I hadn't gotten to this scene yet when I commented earlier. I get why you might have included it but it caught me off guard and really made me dislike him and by extension it made me like the comic less. Prior to that I had found him somewhat sympathetic despite all his other bad decisions, but after that he's the kind of person who calls people slurs to their face for basically no reason.I'm not trying to tell you to change it, it's your story. I'm just trying to describe how it made me feel."", ""\n\nDaniBoy:\nDo you have any techniques you can suggest to give off a textured look with pencils?\nI forgot to answer this question. Don't scan your pages, use camera with a good lighting setup instead. A good smartphone camera is fine too. By using a camera, your colored artwork will be mixed with real light and make it more natural when imported to the digital format.\n\n\nkytri:\nI get why you might have included it but it caught me off guard and really made me dislike him and by extension it made me like the comic less. Prior to that I had found him somewhat sympathetic despite all his other bad decisions, but after that he's the kind of person who calls people slurs to their face for basically no reason.\nYeah, most people hate Drama bomb, It's a hit or miss to the audiences. In this story, the drama bomb even happened when nothing is resolved first. This is a risky way to do, and the author is figuratively holding a ticking bomb. Drama bomb should only be used at later arc.\n\n\ntvtropes.org2\n\n\n\nDrama Bomb - TV Tropes\nThe Drama Bomb is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. In the world of fiction, among the marching armies of tropes and conquering generals, it is a weapon of power scarcely imagined. When a story has been coasting along quite well and …\n\n\n\n\n\n"", '@Draconic Ah, thank you for the clarification.  I\'ve kind of avoided using white lines since my gel pens don\'t like color pencil for some reason? But it does look better, so maybe I\'ll look for some white dip ink or a fountain pen with some white ink.  The lack of money for materials is super unfortunate, when you say painting paper what do you mean? Canvas paper or watercolor paper? Right now I\'m using bristol board.Black paper would be interesting to mess around with, maybe I can figure out how to work it with some illustration attempts, then move onto seeing how that can be incorporated into the comic.\n\n\nDraconic:\nIs that details would help to build up anything?\nThis is the tough part for me.  The comic is character driven, and doesn\'t really have a normal plot, so everything revolves around character development through actions/body language and dialogue.  Like the restaurant scene in chapter 3, I kinda hate it because it\'s just talking.  Although it\'s meant to show a bit more of Apollo\'s personality, introduce Daniel to his friends, and explain some relationship stuff that\'s supposed to have some kind of mumbo-jumbo meaning later on.  Should I just get rid of that scene despite some parts having some importance?I dunno, I feel really dumb about this stuff now.  Like, I\'m glad this is going to be my only comic, because it\'s seems my capabilities to make stories is unsalvageable. Lol.\n@kytri  I\'m so sorry! I knew I forgot to add a warning to to the OP.  Honestly, Apollo isn\'t meant to be really likable, he\'s supposed to be that type who starts out douchey and gets better as he ""wakes up"" essentially.  He\'s openly transphobic, and extremely ignorant/sheltered.  Apollo\'s ""phobia"" kinda has a point too with Julian being a closeted non-binary character, and he has to learn to get over it.The incorporation of that comment wasn\'t meant to be a drama bomb (I mean, the whole comic may as well be a drama bomb so I\'m not saying it\'s incorrect), I just didn\'t know any way I can show he\'s that kind of person in a more delicate way... I\'m not even sure if there is a delicate was to show that sort of thing.\n\n\nDraconic:\nDon\'t scan your pages, use camera with a good lighting setup instead. A good smartphone camera is fine too. By using a camera, your colored artwork will be mixed with real light and make it more natural when imported to the digital format.\nI\'ll have to save up for this... the camera I mean, not the lighting.  Thank you for the suggestion!\nGosh, sorry guys.  I feel kinda bad making you all go through this thing now.  But I am very grateful, you\'ve really taken one for the team dealing with my questioning and this comic.', '\n\nDaniBoy:\nI dunno, I feel really dumb about this stuff now.  Like, I\'m glad this is going to be my only comic, because it\'s seems my capabilities to make stories is unsalvageable. Lol.\nI don\'t think ""I\'m just bad at this"" is what anyone wants you to take away from their critique. The purpose of new eyes on a story/comic is that they have the distance to see things you don\'t. It doesn\'t mean what you\'re already doing is bad, and it doesn\'t mean you\'re lacking in skills for happening to not see it. Some of this develops over time, and some of it can be chalked up to the difficulty of the story you\'re trying to tell.\nGive yourself some credit for tackling difficult subjects in a difficult medium. Heck, writing a character driven story where the main character starts out with some pretty unlikable traits is a huge undertaking. So rather than say anything about your skills are unsalvageable, recognize that you\'re a skilled creator undertaking a highly challenging story, and that\'s perfectly fine. \nOn a seperate note, the art is beautiful, and the story is intriguing. White outline might help- it doesn\'t hurt to try. And keeping an editing eye to unnecessary scenes or scenes going on to long is something most of us have to work on. But like you said, your comic is a character driven slow burn so, it\'s really not terrible if it reads slowly. It\'s just something to keep weighing in your mind as you go. I sort of imagine now that Julian is involved it won\'t feel as slow, anyway, but I don\'t think the pacing is a turn off overall.', ""After reading the tropes page I don't really think this counts as a Drama Bomb. It doesn't really add any drama.\nI should probably preface this by mentioning that I'm trans myself. I'm kind of sensitive and think about these kinds of things a lot. That said, if he'd called her a racial slur instead I think I would have had a similar reaction. I feel like it would have blindsided me less if the terminology were less harsh or if he'd done some more casually transphobic stuff earlier. I think the suddenness was a lot of the issue for me.\nAnyway. Narratively it mostly does two things: it reinforces that our main character is kind of a shitty inconsiderate person, which we already knew, and it outs a trans character to the audience.\nAnd that second part does need to be done. If you have a trans character the audience will assume they're cis until you make it explicit, which sucks. I have a similar problem with my own comic the main character is trans and trying to make it both clear to the audience and not a big deal in the context of the fantasy world the comic is set in is really difficult.\nAs for the camera thing, you'd need a pretty high end camera and lighting setup to rival the image quality of a scanner. Natural media that doesn't scan well often doesn't photograph well either. You can get a lot out of digital touchups for a lot cheaper.\nAlso for a slow burn slice of life type story your pacing is really pretty standard? It is going to come off slow to people who want faster paced stories and that's fine. You can bake a perfect pie and people who only want cake still aren't going to like it."", ""Sorry for the doublepost but I thought I'd take a crack at demonstrating the separating characters from detailed backgrounds thing. I probably spent way too long on this for what is honestly a pretty minor issue. I used the same panel as Draconic for consistency. I don't think the original is bad.\nbgdemo.png381x1332 836 KB\nEdit: Tapas cut it off but if you full view the image there's like 5 variants here\nFirst is the original with no changes.\nSecond has a white halo around the characters, it wouldn't work for all scenes but I think it looks okay here.\nThird has a bolder outline around the characters. I personally use this one pretty often but I think it looks best on art styles that are more cartoony and line focused. I don't think it works great here but it might look good in other scenes.\nNext is one with the background colors adjusted to be more blueish, I did kind of a sloppy job here but if it had been colored that way from the start it could look very nice.\nAnd the last one I made the background lighter and less saturated. Again I did it sloppily but the characters stand out very strongly. You could do either of these last two with the medium you're already using.\nI guess my main point is that you have options, and some options might work better in some situations than in others."", '@SleepingPoppy Lol unsalvageable isn\'t really the best word.  I\'m not really meaning to say ""I\'m just bad"", but it does feel like I\'m having comprehension issues and I do feel bad for it.  I do have a history of being slower (not meaning this as an insult, it\'s one of those things that if you met me irl you\'d notice my mind has a problem with processing.  My reaction time is slower, it takes a bit longer for information to get to my brain, things don\'t always translate correctly.  It takes some hand-holding sometimes.), so I\'m not sure if its that, or my enjoyment for over-saturation of detail is blinding me to when I don\'t need something.Either way I am going to start being more critical with placement of stuff, because what is important to me may not be important to the story.  Like, learning every aspect of my character\'s personalities probably isn\'t necessary, or as entertaining as I find it to be.\nThank you for the reassurance though! I picked a real winner for a comic: Depressing from the first page, the main character is a douchebag, I\'m picking up all the subjects people say not to put in your story.\n@kytri Oh nice! Are you FtM, MtF, or part of the \'other\' gender spectrum? (just so I don\'t misgender you in the future) I\'m NB, but can\'t say I\'ve had a whole lot of personal experience with it since I\'m closeted irl, although I can understand why it\'s so... erg! I guess I sort of based the situation off stuff I overhear a lot.  Most of my coworkers openly throw around \'tranny\' in casual conversation, and can\'t seem to understand that it\'s a slur.  I wanted to do the same for Apollo where he grew up in an environment where he thinks that\'s an okay word when it\'s not, and chalk it up to his ""cis-dude"" ignorance.But yeah! I wanted to also find a way to show Galia is trans since there will be a small, semi-important scene relating to transness later on with her and Julian.  Although I really could have used less offensive unintentional insults, I did feel pretty bad for posting that page.That sucks, though! Unless you establish that world is bigoted in some way, it is super hard to do stuff like that in fantasy settings... even then it can be tough without doing that thing where a character accidentally sees them undressing, someone who knows them says something gross, or they just flat out announce it.\nOn a side-note I do have to tell you (assuming that you might read more in the future) that some of Apollo\'s friends, particularly Brandon, is more grossly transphobic.  So he may end up spouting worse stuff since Apollo and him will be shown at the bar a few times, and Apollo\'s coworkers hate him, I will be sure to leave a CW for pages like that though.  I\'m not gonna lie, by the end of chapter 7 this comic is going to be pretty... uncomfortable, possibly upsetting if you end up getting invested.  Not as far as transphobia, just... the subject matters.\n\n\nkytri:\nAs for the camera thing, you\'d need a pretty high end camera and lighting setup to rival the image quality of a scanner. Natural media that doesn\'t scan well often doesn\'t photograph well either. You can get a lot out of digital touchups for a lot cheaper.\nAh, I figured you\'d have to basically have professional photography equipment to get a good shot.  My cousin does painting for a living, and he uses some pretty high end stuff to photograph is work for social media.\n\n\nkytri:\nSorry for the doublepost but I thought I\'d take a crack at demonstrating the separating characters from detailed backgrounds thing. I probably spent way too long on this for what is honestly a pretty minor issue. I used the same panel as Draconic for consistency. I don\'t think the original is bad.\nAAH! Thank you so much! This actually gives me a really good idea of the things I can do.  I\'ve been wanting to play around with contrasts and stuff more, I think it would look really nice, and make the comic more readable.  I just need to get out of this obsession with making everything look so literal/flat.\nAlso thank you for the feedback! Even though I tend to text-wall and come off as really bitchy, I really do take in the critiques and ween myself into applying them.', ""\n\nDaniBoy:\nThank you for the reassurance though! I picked a real winner for a comic: Depressing from the first page, the main character is a douchebag, I'm picking up all the subjects people say not to put in your story.\nXD Okay, I just wanted to make sure you didn't feel discouraged!\nAnd I can totally understand processing information differently/slowly. I'm dyslexic, and several family members are dyslexic and ADD. No judgement hear, regardless. ^^\n@kytri @DaniBoy  Separate note, I don't know if either of you have read Knights Errant, but it might be a useful example of Trans/NB characters in a fantasy setting? Though they want farther into the identities of the characters in the original version, the reboot hasn't gone as in depth yet. (Feel free to ignore if you already know about it or otherwise don't find it helpful!)"", ""I know of Knights Errant but to be honest I haven't kept up with it. Last I looked at it was well before the reboot.I remember a male presenting character being revealed to be AFAB, but I don't remember if at the time it was clear that he was trans and not that it was a woman crossdressing to do man stuff situation. I remember it being a sort of big reveal kind of moment though which is something I'm specifically trying to avoid doing."", ""The current iteration is pretty different from the original. There is still kind of a reveal for one character, and while not subtle, it's less clothes-taking-off-y. I think the over all tone and thought going into the story is better worked out this time around, though. And it's still really early as far as addressing the identities of the characters. So might be useful to check out, but I can't say it'd be quite what you're looking for. There's two characters handled two different ways though."", ""I'll probably give it a second look eventually. I liked it well enough.And I should probably make a thread for my own comic so I don't take this one too far off topic."", ""Naaah, it does help me realize I shouldn't try to monetize my comic since it's not quality enough... and I only post one page a week, but I got a story stuck in my head that I want to get out so I'm gonna keep going.\nLol that's something I always thought I had.  Words and numbers get mixed up a lot when I'm reading, talking, or typing/writing. (not so bad with writing which is why I hand letter my comic)  Who knows, maybe someday I'll get insurance and go see a doctor to find out why my brain is so trash. xD  Thank you for understanding though.\nI actually read Knights Errant in... high school? Maybe a little after, seeing the art for it around Twitter has made me want to check it out again, I never got very far the first time."", ""I disagree that it's not quality enough. I've seen plenty of worse comics that people are able to monetize, they may just be better at selling their work. It's not a judgement on quality. \nAlso you've got a story featuring angsty characters and beautiful art, both of which are very marketable.""]",10/2/2018 14:44,https://forums.tapas.io/t/requesting-critique/27629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any feedback/critique appreciated. Other than updating the comic, where should I go from here? I've been studying comic creation heavily recently, and I've been practicing panel composition, character design, lettering, and etc., but I'm not an expert.","[""Ooh, cool premise! This promises for a really neat story with twists and turns \nFor your most recent version, I noticed that you started off directly with the conflict. We don't get to know anything at all about the main character - his soul is taken by a demon on the very first page. And since you do only have one page, I can't really tell if that's intentional or not.We don't know why this demon is even taking Elijah's soul in the first place. And we don't know that Elijah's a good guy without the help of the description box telling us everything (well, we have a couple of shots of the framed prayer on his table, but that's about it). Without this information, it makes for a pretty awkward starting point.\nBut who knows? You only have one page so far, so for all I know, I could be totally wrong. Maybe come back when you have more content, and you'll receive some more helpful feed back  looking forward to what comes!"", 'Yeah. I agree with the pacing. I think I\'m going somewere with it that addresses those concerns, although how well it does so, I\'m not sure. My plan is to have flashbacks that fill in that information. He goes to Hell, wonders ""Why am I here?"", flashback to him doing all this ""good"" stuff, and then it cuts back to hell with that question still unanswered.\nWe\'ll see where that goes or how that works out. I think you\'re right. I need to get more content.\nEDIT: Forgot to thank you for your feedback! Thanks you!', ""It intrigues from the very first lines. What can I say, I'm excited"", 'I like the premise so far where someone who sacrificed their life to their faith receives punishment. Its someone a strong parellel to how they feel deep inside sometimes. Well, this is based on the premise but, we have no in-story evidence of his good nature. Maybe having one frame showing a bag of canned goods in the corner of the room with a note that says, ""For shelter"" can help establish to the audience his good nature. \nThe panelling is alot cleaner in the 2018 version and the art style has a realistic/anime look that fits the tone of the comic. The religious facts seems accurate in the more recent version.\nI started to remake a comic I made in 2015 called Seishin Patona last year. I am on the fourth chapter right now. Although with this latest version of the story I gave it the title Distant Duality since its easier to remember and I fleshed out the world a bit more. With this latest version i plan to complete the first five chapters and submit it to Tapas Premium so they can do some of the comic\'s promotion for me because I am practically unknown so I need some assistance.\nSorry the long rant I agree that you comic has potential and I want to see where it goes.']",10/21/2018 1:33,https://forums.tapas.io/t/recreated-a-comic-from-4-years-ago-feedback/28060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a few short chapters for my light novel (https://tapas.io/episode/71735422), and I would appreciate if someone could critique it for me. 
The setting is a near-future Philippines, and the theme is a ""more realistic"" (for what that's worth) take on the trapped-in-a-VR genre. I'll be happy to answer questions along the way. 
Reviewer must have a strong stomach for amateurish writing, and must not burn too deep. LOLJK
Thanks in advance! ","['Oh man this is late ;;\nGrammar / Flow\nSome things I noticed from the prologue:\nMislabeled dialogue tags.\ni.e. \n\nPrologue:\n“Yes,” Dr. Imperio nodded.\nYou were close, but not quite there. Dialogue tags are for showing how a person says something. Their tone, voice, volume, etc. Nodding, as a verb, does none of this. Plus, you can\'t actually nod words unless the gesture somehow is a part of the speaker\'s language.\n\nTo fix this, I recommend using something else to show how he says yes. Maybe, ""Yes,"" Dr. Imperio said with a nod.or ""Yes,"" Dr. Imperio said while giving a slow nod.\nThe possibilities are endless! Keep a look out for this when writing dialogue scenes.\nNext, tense switching. Although your novel is written mainly in past tense, there are instances where you accidentally use present. \n\ni.e. For a few moments all that can be heard is the soft, continuous beeping of the security module overhead.\nThis would be fine if you wrote in present tense, but you don\'t. Definitely switch the ""can"" to ""could.""\nI also, for some reason, believe the prologue would be much better without the beeps between dialogue. This sentence shows that nicely without interrupting the dialogue. But this is just my opinion, so feel free to ignore this. c:\nThirdly, dialogue punctuation. I noticed a few times where you placed a comma after a question someone asked.\n\ni.e. “What do you mean?”, a thick, booming voice from the other end of the long table finally replied.(P.S., you might want to consider changing this to a questioning verb like ask or query. Might be just me, though.)\nSince the question mark is already there, the comma isn\'t necessary in any of the similar instances you used it in.\nAh, almost forgot. In cases like yours where your book is action-packed and fast-paced, it\'s best to use action-focused sentence structure, especially during the action. By using passive language, you\'re slowing down the experience unintentionally. \n\nIt works here:He had been lying in ambush for nearly two hours, waiting for anything that would betray the presence of his prey. But not so much here: In three short motions, he had sent a canned message to his employer.\nbecause this can be shortened to ""...he sent a canned(what does this mean?) message to his employer.""\nHopefully the difference is clear.', 'Description / Setting buildup\nOkay so, off the bat I can see a noticeable problem. Your scenery describing is a tad off.\ni.e. during the prologue meeting, you had 4-6 people in a room but readers had no idea what they looked like other than someone having a ""booming voice."" In order to fully immerse your readers into the plot, you have to give us subtle descriptors to guide us in imaging the various scenes.\nThe meeting is tense? Express how stressed all the members are through creased eyebrows, huffs, tightened fists or anything else you can think of. The key is to make them memorable. Also, take the time to focus on describing the rooms. I had no idea there was a table until you mentioned it halfway into the prologue. You can do it! cx\nThis may just be my limited knowledge of the field, but is ""octogenerian"" normally passed around? It sounds very unnatural in this context, especially when you could show his age in various ways.\nThat being said, your describing definitely improves in the next chapter. Keep your head up! You\'ll improve with more practice. Maybe even try looking at pictures of scenery and describing how your characters would interact with it. (*ﾟ∀ﾟ)\nIts rider was dressed in a silken green robe that hid his dull steel armor. In his right hand was a bone-white scepter with a flaming orb on top, its other end tapering to a dangerous point. \nThere we go, that\'s the description I want to see in the prologue. I\'m glad to see you\'re improving with every chspter you write. Quick note, though. I\'m guessing this is written in third-perspective limited (aka only one character\'s pov). That being the case, I don\'t think he\'d notice the soldier\'s dull armor if was successfully hidden by his robe. Watch out for those small details.\nThat being said, sometimes you also overdescribe, too. Rather, your descriptions are somewhat cluttered.\n\ni.e. What struck Cube the most was the Viceroy\'s head. It was in the image of a huge carved pumpkin, the type one sees during Halloween.\nThis is too... wordy. With describing features, it\'s best to have prose while being straightforward, if that makes sense.\nThis is something I just noticed, but try not to info-dump when writing. It sort of drags the reader away for a history lesson, so to speak. Basically, it distracts the reader from what\'s going on. \n\ni.e. In the real world, history has been made by people like Cube. It was his kind who toppled Caesar and the Roman Republic, his kind who precipitated World War I — thereby reshaping the world in the aftermath. In the real, assassins toppled whole armies, governments, ideologies. It was not so different in «ALT».\nGiven the way you ended Chapter 1, I honestly expected to jump right into action with the 2nd, but for some reason you bring up human history. It\'s cool how you mentioned it, but since a battle\'s about to start and we\'re in Cube\'s POV, I don\'t think now\'s the time to be thinking about this. \nOn the other hand, you could introduce us to Cube\'s emotions instead. How\'s he feeling, about to step into an assassination attempt? Confident? Terrified? Make sure to bring this up, as it develops your character(s) more.', 'Characterization / Behavior\nThese will mostly be comments about characters that pop up in the story.\nLet\'s start with Cube\n\nFirst Impression: A young adult having fun in a terrifyingly realistic VR FPS game. He seems to be experienced, which explains his confidence. But he\'s also cautious, which is great because he knows not to pointlessly put himself in danger.\n\nObservations: Before the NPC lieutenant finished his sentence, a blade of light sliced him clean in half. His skeleton body disintegrated in a shower of bright sparks, bouncing against the shiny coat of the Viceroy\'s chariot.\nI\'m gonna take a stab and say Cube did this. If so, nice. Your description here\'s good too, and brings attention to how people are ""deleted"" in the game before turning the attention back to the scene. Again, nice! ヾ(｡>﹏<｡)ﾉﾞ✧*。\nCube leapt back to put some distance between him and his quarry. Around them, the invisible forest floor was already starting to catch fire from the earlier attacks. The remainder of the Viceroy\'s minions stopped attacking, standing motionless as if watching the duel.\nNice thinking, Q! But I\'m wondering why mention the forest floor is ""invisible""? Kinda makes it seem like they\'re standing on air. You already have the aspects of the VR world\'s technical features down with the Battle Windows and Q\'s inbox, so no need to make it obvious we aren\'t setting an actual forest on fire. I doubt he\'d think about reality vs. gaming while in a mission.\n""I\'m flattered you\'ve heard about me, but that moniker sounds a bit too pretentious. You may call me Cube — perhaps after you\'ve created a new avatar!""\nDoes he... talk like this in real life? Or is this his way of role-playing? Hurm. In one way it shows how immersed he is in the game\'s setting and character, but in another it sounds kind of pretentious itself. The way he speaks here just seems off, somehow. But maybe that\'s because of his arrogance. Not sure.\nA window appeared in mid-air between the two players — «Cube_3_0409 HAS FORCED A PERMADEATH MATCH!»\nBut how does what he said means he forced a death match? I\'m pretty sure they both held at least an inkling of killing intent towards each other.\nThe target\'s head tilted in surprise. “Too sure of ourselves, aren\'t we? I don\'t think you realize what you\'ve gotten yourself into.”\nHaha, my thoughts exactly, Jack o lantern! But seriously, I\'m loving this dude. Too bad he\'s gotta go.\nJerry was silent for a second. Then, a hearty laugh echoed across the field. “Looks like you did your homework.”\nWaitttttt, his name is Jerry? When was that mentioned? Honestly thought it was Pumpkin Head on Pumpkill. Gotta work on introducing peeps without using dialogue, bud! Still, I\'m not sure why Cube felt the need to mention his name. Kind of an odd response to ""you don\'t know what you\'re getting yourself into.""\nMoving on to Jarry aka Smashed Pumpkin\nFirst Impressions: Maybe it\'s just my preference, but I loved his demeanor. The way he !talked like he had everything planned out was refreshing. Although cold, you showed us more of him when he disposed of his army while trying to kill Cube. You make it clear he\'s an enemy, but a charming one. However, I feel like the way you introduced his name―as mentioned above―is somewhat awkward. Just saying it quickly in a dialogue along with a number of other facts doesn\'t hold much of an impact for me. \nObservations: I really enjoyed his dialogue. I don\'t know, it\'s just smooth and natural. I ended up rooting for him because of how much charisma he gave off. Whether of not that\'s a good thing depends on your intent with introducing him, I think.\nWhen the dust cleared, the «PUMPKIN JACK» was nowhere in sight. A slight rustle behind Cube caused him to dash forward, twisting his torso to meet the enemy.\nTHE Pumpkin Head? Unless that\'s a species/title name, I\'d delete the \'the\'. Maybe even stick to Jarry, since Cube is so knowledgeable. \n«BLAZING VINES»! A rough voice echoed through the woods\nWhose voice, though? I mean, I\'m assuming Jarry because he mainly uses fire and all but I\'d rather not make wrong assumptions. Also, lowercase \'a\' since that\'s a dialogue tag. You also forgot a period at the end.\nThin ropes of flame shot out from the ground and wrapped themselves around Cube\'s wrists and ankles. They strained and pulled, yanking the avatar from its leap and trapping it in mid-air.\nSince Cube is a real person, I\'m not sure why you chose to make the pronoun \'it\'. Sure, it\'s a bunch of coding and stuff, but it\'s still Cube and reflecting his actions and emotions.\nBefore Cube could react, the ground burst into flames. It enveloped his armor, spreading rapidly from his boots, to his greaves, all the way to his breastplate. But what caught Cube off-guard wasn\'t the fact that the skill didn\'t seem to do anything to his HP Bar. Instead, he was seized with fear at the debilitating, searing sensation that spread around his body as the blaze consumed him.\nWoo! Nice description! Keep going! (≧▽≦)\nSuddenly, we\'re introduced to Ren in chapter 3.\nFirst impression: After reading the line about her waking up, three thoughts came to mind.\n\nShe had to be Cube or Pumpkin Head, and just chose to play as a dude in the VR.\nBut if 1 is true, did she wear the VR to sleep? Is the game played in their dreams? Since games need a certain amount of focus, would any player get proper rest if that were the case?\nI\'m overthinking this.\n\nAfter that, I read on to get answers to the questions burning my brain cells. Lo and behold, \n\nStill yawning, Ren got up from the bed and fumbled for the blue denim jacket thrown haphazardly across her headboard.\nQuick note. The paragraph before this didn\'t mention her yawning. I recommend rereading this.\nThat leaves 20 minutes of free time left, barely enough time for a bite before her next class.\nPresent tense → Past tense. •̀.̫•́✧\nHmm, the paragraph about her getting ready didn\'t really have a sense of urgency imo. Is she on dorm? How close is she from the building her class is in? It feels slightly nonchalant, but that might be what you wanted to accomplish. After all, some people believe time waits for them.\nObservations: From her interactions with Penelope, she seems chill, and could possibly have a crush on Cube. But other than that, I\'m not sure why we\'re in her perspective suddenly. I feel like it would\'ve been better to introduce her after the battle, so we aren\'t left hanging until the next chapter.', ""I haven't finished yet, and noticed you haven't updated in awhile, so I hope this helps!\nP.S.

492,Getting subscribers? Review Request? Tapas and Webtoons,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So i recently started posting one of my comics on webtoon and it isn't doing as well as i hoped I would.It got around 34 PVs and only one subscriber. I find this odd since another comic I did that i barely put any work into got around the same number of PVs and got 6 subscribers. This is especially confusing to me since that comic was just a one-off test with one episode and only 7 pages, while the comic I am actually putting work into has 5 chapters with 3 pages each. So I am wondering if someone could tell me what I am doing wrong in my new comic. Is it maybe the fact that I stretch out the scenes too much or maybe that I do not immediately established the main character well enough, since I plan to do it in the next chapter. Does anyone have any ideas how to improve and what do you think, is the beginning too much of a handicap, can i fix the problem by bettering the rest of the comic or should i just abandon this project and move on to the next one, since i did think of making this comic into a long series. Just give me a critic of every thing I am doing both good and bad, since i do plan on changing my writing and art style soon. Also it would mean a lot if someone could tell me what their average PV/Subscriber ratio was so i can compare. 
Ps. Maybe I am overreacting a bit since I do have generalized anxiety but I just wanted to check what others think.
Here are the links:Old19New29","['I’m  gonna say that it might help if you made the comics longer on WEBTOON . Those first five would have made for a great first intro page. The expectation is that for superhero comics on WEBTOON is that they are closer to 25 or 30 panels per ep. this may mean updating less often.', ""It's probably too early in your run to draw any conclusions yet."", 'So I should put all the 5 chapters into one, and than upload the 10 pages i have ready next month?', 'The recommendation for webtoon is for this type of comic around 20 panels a page, once a week. This works best with the algorithms they have. What normally happens is this- each time you update it averages out how many PV you have per episode and then for ""by popularity"" listing, raises and drops you accordingly. Because of this many comics drop a bit for the day until their subscribers realize that their person updated and go look. This also means new people just browsing through the comics will have a harder time finding you as you are further and further down the list.\nMy recommendation, go-ahead and combine those pages into a single update, determine which pages you can combine and then make a update schedule for yourself. Once a week to start would probably be best. In the meantime focus on making comics that fit the 20+ panel guideline and try to build a buffer. Lastly, remember that it will take time for people to find your comic and subscribe. Subscriber yourself (you can do that!) ask friends, and when there are good threads to do so- mention and link your comic within the forum. \nConsider looking at other comics that are doing well in discover and see how they lay out panels, do their spacing, story pacing, and how many panels per comic. I recommend looking at DISCOVER section comics as most of those are just one or two people, where some of the feature ones have teams of 5 or more (plus they have editors to help!).', '\nOne-issue comics seems more saturated for me and already have more revealed idea, while three-issue comics is only on the stage of beginning of the plot.

I was thinking of removing all the information about the in universe stuff and just focusing on the main characters motivations using a lot less text and leaving a lot more space without text.

Thanks for the help. "", ""As some general advice, I recommend not comparing your own works against each other based on how much effort you put into it.  As creators we tend to think that the audience can tell really easily whether something took a lot of work or a little and they respond to that, but the truth is, it's not generally the case.  Every author I know has complained at some point that something they just tossed out into the wild is doing better than the thing they spent their blood and tears on.  It's extremely common!

Not to discourage you or anything, I just want you to improve.\nThe artstyle in the first one is not pretty. in fact, it's ugly. there is so much text everywhere and the pages look very messy and undesirable to read. there is no space between panels, no room to breathe, you fill each speech bubble to the brim, don't do that or people will be too lazy to read it. In my comic (here)6 I tend to sometimes stop talking and let people live an atmosphere. This is a nicer way to learn about someone. in real life we tend to be quite more often than we talk. show that. \nFor your second comic your style is noticeably better, I'm glad you stopped using pencil and went fully digital.

My main objective through joining the contest was to try to find more readers who were interested in my stuff compared to discover. I knew I wasn't going to win since my comic seems like something that isn't webtoon material (not to say my comic is bad, I'm glad you think it looks good :), it just has a different atmosphere that may not correlate well to webtoons brand).\nI noticed I was getting less views and lower ratings, and I had a feeling that would ve pretty damaging in the long run, so I decided to take my comic out of the contest and go back to discover. In a shorter amount of time, more people are reading my comic and are giving it better ratings and views (I know different people, but there's a factor there imo).\nIt's probably for the best though since I put a lot of energy and effort to grow my comic over three years and I don't want to hinder or rush my comic for the deadlines of a comic. \nWhatever floats one's boat "", ""I joined 3 days ago.

A few notes as well, first two episodes started out traditional comic page format, then moved to vertical. The story is also formatted to be episodic, but connecting in a sense, and each episode is divided into thirds
Anyway, if anyone is wanting or willing to give this a good in depth review, that would be fantastic
Thank you so much, and God Bless!","[""Been looking for a reason to check this one out (not to say I never had interest). The next day I have off work I'll be sure to give it a full read and pass on my thoughts."", ""Thank you very much, it's very much appreciated ^^"", ""Appealing art style, easy to read dialogues, and good pacing.But I think you could work a little more on the shadows. Sometimes you shade the characters' faces, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you shade the characters' scarves, others you don't. For the sake of consistency, make sure you decide whether you want to shade an area or not, then stick to it."", 'Thank you Kirsch.\nI will say this, part of the issue is the shading style changes made throughout the series that’s caused this inconsistency. Currently I’m solidifiying it more, and it should end up being more consistent', ""You're welcome, and good luck! "", ""I knew there was something I was forgetting to do this week, sorry bout that.\nI've known about your comic since first starting tapas two years back, but for some reason I never checked out too many comics during that time due to focusing on my own at the time (which honestly hasn't changed all that much). I could have sworn this comic was a lot more sketchier looking when I first saw it, but I must have imagined that.\nI think the dynamics and angles you use are unique and interesting enough to keep me engaged. I like comics that are willing to really push a dynamic action scene instead of playing it safe and stale. The character designs are what really peaks my interest, it screams dynamic and charm, (Granted I'm only on story 2). Facial expressions scream out to me too, some are really goofy and easily remembered the one I think about is alligator gals introductory smile and evil boss at the toward the end of story arc 1. Everything about it feels like pure stupid action fun (not an insult). \nIf I had any complaints its the dialogue, but I'm fully aware that the story is set in the swamp/wetland South so some dialogue I had trouble understanding, and like any heavy action comics there's hardly any character development outside of what the character is currently doing at this direct time. Sometimes the comic seems to be rushing too, like you just want things to get done now, my example for this is at the end of story 1 you already introduce alligator girl, but chapter 2 starts with some kind of build-up, but I already know what she looks like kind of thing.\nOther than that it was still a fun read, and look forward to more episodes in the near future.7/10 (I like the aesthetics of the comic and it's entertaining to look at)""]",11/8/2018 21:07,https://forums.tapas.io/t/requesting-review-s-the-unbreakable-freak-of-nature/28611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would greatly appreciate any comments about how much I have succeed (or not), and, of course, will review your comics in return."", ""Heya, cool comic! I'll throw in my two cents if you'd like!The story isn't long enough for me to say much about the plot or the characters, but I like the info sheets where you describe pieces of tech. Solid worldbuilding so far, I think! The art is easily readable, and I really like the augmented reality overlays, the darker colour palette and the grainy texture. You can tell right away what genre this comic's in. Unfortunately, sometimes the poses and expressions look just a little stiff, especially in the action scenes. The choreography isn't bad at all, but practising gesture drawings using photo or real-life reference might help make the action look more dynamic. Here's my comic if you want to drop by: \n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nSideways | Tapas\nWhen Des picks on the new kid in class, she finds herself transported to an alien world one step sideways from our own. \nUpdates Sundays.\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""Thank you for your review! Glad to hear that the art is clear and info sheets are interesting \nAbout your story:I like how your reveal the unusual nature of this new kid in class step by step. First his ability to blink in the strange way, then his teeth, then close-up which shows his eyes... it's fun. The fear, unwillingness to communicate and cruelty of a girl and another kids to this strange kid are sadly realistic even if he really didn't do anything bad. The alien world looks pretty interesting. But I didn't get why they have suddenly teleported here? Is it because girl hit the boy, or for some completely other reason? This point is unclear for me.Overall, I like it because it is original and I can't tell what will happen next, so it keeps interest of reader. "", ""Hey, I gave it a quick read \nFirst things first: I can already see improvement in your new chapter, which is super great! The action has become much more dynamic than in the first action sequence. I also like the use of augmented reality and the info pages on thech are interesting to read. Using stuff like that in a story always is a plus in my book (though I must admit that the iF**k wasn't quite my sense of humor. The I'm sorry.exe file though? I laughed at that ^^). I can't really tell where the story is going right now, but giving the main characters a sort of antagonistic relationship at the start could be a fun setup for later interactions, so that was good. \nI have some suggestions that might help improve your comic overall. First  would recommend to get someone to help you with the english dialogue (I assume you're not a native speaker?). The dialogue is perfectly understandable, but I saw some mistakes here and there, that made the dialogue sound a little clunky. \nI also think the art could use a little bit more detail as the expressions and poses sometimes look kinda stiff. The artstyle works, it's just a little too basic right now. I also would recommend to use a figure tool for the geometrical shapes in the background (like the train in the first pages). I use them all the time to create smooth curves or straight lines. Using a line stabilizer can also help to draw smoother lines in general. It's super helpful and most programs have this option ^^ Which program are you using, btw? And are you drawing with a tablet or a mouse? \nI think the overall composition is functional and works well in illustrating what is happening. As ScribbleJay said: all is easily readable. I would also say that the grainy texture is a good choice that helps the mood of your story.\nFor now I would concentrate on training anatomy and lineart. For the backgrounds I recommend looking at references and maybe using a figure tool for the geometric shapes. Can't say too much about the story yet, but if you build well on the protagonists relationship and establish a good conflict for the story, it could be a lot of fun!\nI hope my feedback was useful.  \nThis is my comic.

I appreciate the detalization of it, so I\'ll try to answer in detail too.About the dialogs: I don\'t know how to convince somebody to check spelling carefully through all the text and correct all mistakes for free.  It should be a corrector\'s work. And I don\'t have a money right now. But if you found some of them through reading anyway and have a spare minute, I would greatly appreciate if you tell about them in comments.  About the shapes: yep, I\'ve started to use simple 3d character models, shapes and guidance lines to better depict dynamic poses and, for example, make the sword moving direction consistent with body moving direction.About the instruments: I\'m using Photoshop with mouse (plus pencil sketches sometimes).\n\nYour comics\nYour comics is pretty long, so I still didn\'t read it completely (sorry). When I\'ve subscribed, I\'ve read just some of the last pages, and notice some sci-fi-style action (which I like) but didn\'t know what it all about. Now I\'ve read from the beginning to understand the setting in which events are going on, and just completed Chapters 1 and 2. So I will try to summarize my thoughts about them mostly, using ""?"" marks to note the misunderstandings.\nPlot and characters revealing:Chapter 1: It gives an idea of the life of the main character and her surroundings and depicts it pretty clearly (btw I know that my story isn\'t so good in this aspect, but I\'ll try to compensate it in the next episodes  ).If I understand correctly, Silhouette and other strange-looking persons are some sort of mutants (but I didn\'t get if they really can spread the infection or it is just a superstition ?). Anyway, it seems realistic to me that people feel xenophobia to them and that they answer with a cruelty, too. I like how you avoid black-and-white thinking here and show situation from different angles. In the more simple setting of this kind, rebellion of mutants should be white, but it is not the case here, which is shown clearly from Silhouette\'s argumentation about why she don\'t want to join the rebellion. At the end we see that nevertheless she dreams about the better life too.Chapter 2: It is interesting to see how characters are revealed further here and also to see their adventures in the high city. I just had a problem with understanding two things, and first of them is Chap 2 Pg 51-53. I was able to figure out what\'s going on here more or less after reading your conversation with catluckey in the comments, but I still didn\'t understand what did the doctors remove from her body ? The second misunderstanding is why she suddenly changed her opinion about the rebellion ? Well, she suffered, but it dont\' undo her first argumentation that rebellion destabilizes the situation and can lead to declaring infected outside the law and mass murder in the case of failure of their revolution.\nArt:You have your own style, which is nice. For example, I like how you depict landscaped and devices. But people\'s faces and poses aren\'t well sometimes. The most noticeable is your problem with side-view. For example, when you depict Silhouette\'s face in profile, she often seems worse and not similar with herself in full face. The proportions of the face are not always met, too.\nAction:Action scenes seems pretty dynamic and clear for me, even if poses sometimes are a bit strange.\nAt the overall, it is totally not bad. It is clear that you have a plan of a plot and trying your best to implement it. I wonder why it has so low range at Webtoons, it is totally not fair.  I think that it deserves at the very least 7-8 from 10.', 'Hey, thanks for taking so much time in reading through my work. Didn\'t expect you to go this far into it  \nFirst to answer your questions about my review: You can always ask your audience if one might want to help in exchange for an early access to your story or something. Some might be up for that  But I\'ll go over some mistakes later after work, no problem (but I\'m not a native speaker myself, so I might be off as well =D)\nPhotoshop has good tools for shapes and lines I think and there are good tutorials out there. Checking those might help a lot. I gave this a quick skim over and it seems to explain a lot. But there\'s much more out there so you\'ll surely find a tutorial that fits your needs. How to Draw Anime Lineart with a PC Mouse - Photoshop CS6 Brush Setup Tutorial\nI\'d also recommend to invest in a tablet, but I totally understand if the money situation doesn\'t allow for that. \nMy ComicThank you again for going so in depth. I am very thankful for the time and effort you put into your review of it!\nAs for the story questions: I wanted to leave it ambiguous in the beginning as to weather the infection is dangerous or not, but it will be a huge focus of chapter 5. I also used the operation in the second chapter to imply that ""spreading the infection"" simply refers to giving birth to new mutants. That\'s why they remove Silhouettes reproductive organs, when they catch her trespassing the human parts of the city. But I get how that might not be clear. I tried to tell it visually, but a little dialogue might have helped to make it clearer. \nAs for the change in character... hm. My goal was to show, that Silhouette might have been a little indifferent, when the human injustices didn\'t affect her directly, but discovered her drive for revenge, when she got hurt herself. It\'s tricky. She really doesn\'t care for the rebellion, but she very much cares about hurting the people, that hurt her. It\'s...not easy to convey stuff like that, but I\'ll try to improve so it gets more clear in the future. In my head it all makes sense, so it\'s hard to guess how much explaining needs to be done, haha. \nArtThe proportion and art consistency thing really is a huge challenge for me. The pages of chapter 1 are two years old at this point, so I like to imagine I got a bit better at that, but it\'s still challenging. I\'ll keep practicing. Have to do it with every new page anyways  Thanks for the feedback on the profile view. I didn\'t even notice that most of the time. \n\n\ntired_programmer:\nI wonder why it has so low range at Webtoons, it is totally not fair. \nYeah well... I got some one star ratings that dragged me down, I think. I get why. It\'s a comic about people, who are pretty much terrorists. And the drawings could also use a bit of work. But I\'m of course not happy with how it is received. I can\'t really help it for now. Maybe it\'ll gain some more fans in the future, but for now it is, how it is. I am glad that you enjoyed it so far. So thank you for your thorough feedback.

ROYAL | Tapas
Entering what would be considered College, Two Brothers find anything but a usual school life. but what do you expect when the school is for extraordinary people





I will admit, at first I jumped into this not knowing what I was getting into. I'm not much into manga or anime like I used to back when it was fresh and new to the West, so the manga-style just hasn't clicked much as it used to, with maybe a few exceptions here and there. And then I caught wind of Royal after playing with the busted search engine here.
The prologue's got some intriguing coloring. The dark-ish, yet homey color scheme mixed in with some good angles on each panel really works out. But that's not to say that the black-and-white pages are any slack either. Color designs are what you'd get from a manga from the 2000s. Like the kinds of webcomics/animations you'd get in newgrounds. For what it is, I think that's what helps its charm. Though, I will say, that the artist really knows how to do some angles, paneling, wording, and character placement. 
While you've got the snarky, brash, and unapologetic Oliver, you've got this clumsy, polite, innocent, kind guy in Junior (or Jr) for short, as he's just trying to get through the day without messing up. I really like dynamics like that, and even like to write that on my own too.
The story starts off with the two brothers, Junior and Oliver, starting what seems to be a new year of college. And things seem to go easy at first, but it doesn't take long for the brothers to run into some lesser folk that already want them dead (i.e. When Elliot threatens to steal Oliver's Soul). What may slightly confuse some readers is the lack of knowing what this school's about, why it's here, who made it, and how do some of these students have magic powers and some don't. As much as most stories nowadays will tell you everything all at once in the first chapter, other ones are more willing to hold back until later on. Though, I will admit, I had to take a second read once I got to one of the more stranger sections of Royal in the early first chapter. Then again, we are following both Jr AND Oliver, so there might be some secrets that these brothers are hiding that we just haven't seen yet. And chapter 2 gets even more weirdly intriguing once we get introduced by the looovveeelllyyyy Ms. Sweet. Though, I will say that HER being a sex ed teacher was a bit on the nose. If she was like a history or physical education teacher or something, that would have made it funnier.  Imagine the fanservice. (I'll have to keep that in mind now).
What the first chapter DOES do well is setup Jr. Who is he, exactly? Why does he think everyone thinks he is a monster? What did Jr do exactly, and where will he go from here? What constantly happens to Jr that he finds himself in this trouble? And from what I can tell, it feels kinda like that song by The Fixx. Y'know, this one here:
The Fixx - One Thing Leads to Another
And Chapter 2 finds him getting into some scrupulous, succulent trouble with the Sweet Lady, which hopefully will be continued very soon. I want to know what she's searching for DANG IT!! 
PROS* Nice Main Characters* Very stylized coloring and shading (especially in the prologue)Jr is very kindly and likable and mixes well with Oliver's jackeryWe get to follow the brothers equally throughout the storyI love those action scenes, and the sense of mysteryThis, I could/would classify as an action series, with a sense of comedy and mystery throughout. I wanna know about this school in some later chapter and/or at least the people who enroll in it, like Jr.
Chapter 1 opens up pretty good, and chapter 2 follows along quite nicely.
CONS* I wish there were some more colored pages like in the prologue. NOT THE ENTIRE COMIC, but maybe some one-off pages.* The immediate jump into action may throw some readers off a little
WISHES(The Burrito Queen needs to give me Ms. Sweet's number so I can hire her.)Y'know. I happen to have another weird town and school that's got some strange paranormal magic lurking about. wink wink, nudge nudge.
BONUSI will say, I am getting small vibes of this song whenever I read some of Royal:Primal Rage Arcade Soundtrack All the Rage:Rock-n-Rage (Ending Credits Theme)
FINAL VERDICT
I give this comic 7 and a half Sexy Jr's. out of 10 (7.5 out of 10). A real good comic with lots of promise, potential, and could even be open to some real good ideas when the time is right. But for now, what we have is good enough to satisfy that action itch with a sense of underlying paranormal mystery.

The style and color vary a little from one update to the other for me it’s a funny way to explore the slice of life genre and it also can help you to find your style.I haven’t found any mistake in any aspect of your comic so keep up with the good work!!! ', ""Thank you! I'm glad you're also liking it! "", ""I always love a good critique exchange!! Whenever I see one I can't help but participate!\nI just finished going through chapter 1 of your comic. I am really digging your art style! Your colors really pop, and I can tell you think through your shading. I also like the sketch quality of your line work. What you're doing with your backgrounds is working well, I like that you've chosen not to outlines them so that your characters stand out more against them and don't get lost. Your story so far is great!\nThe only element I'd made a suggestion on is your word bubbles. Maybe it's because you were still exploring and testing, but it seemed like the font changed 4 or 5 times throughout the first chapter. Try to pick one that you like best and run with it, it can be kind of jarring when each page has a new font, unless you're using the font change to represent something, such as a character speaking differently than everyone else. Also, try to keep the font size consistent as well. Pick a point size that's the normal talking level for your characters, and then only make it larger or smaller if you're trying to emphasize that they're talking louder or quieter than usual.\nOther than that you are off to a great start! I've subscribed and I look forward to Chapter 2!\nIf you'd like to check out my comic and give a critique back, here it is -\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nStop Watchers | Tapas\nA humorous, action, adventure comic that follows a team of Stop Watchers, whose job it is to stop time criminals from changing the past. Their job is not to change the past, but to prevent those who wish to.\n\nHarper Wells’ life was pretty bland in...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'I’m surprised I liked it \nI’m not much into fantasy; but you won me over with lovely, lovely characters and what looks to be some solid plot happening!\nMy compliants are only about small things. You seems to REALLY NAIL the pace of your story which impressed me a lot(I see few people do that very well). But I feel it could use some more visual dynamism in the action shots. The text a little bit hard to read on mobile. Your backgrounds are great! But I feel that some shots don’t really need a background, it makes things look too busy.\nOverall you have something really good coming along and I hope to see more!! However, I think it would be good for you to study how other comic artists do their compositions and action shots. And I would recommend not studying another webcomic artist but rather looking into notable, old-school comics and manga.\nOh and here’s my comic:\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nCrime & Cars | Tapas\nA very interesting story about the schemes and misadventures of a cold trophy-wife, Renée, and a cocky teen scoundrel, Rudy, set in circa 1930s. Stay tuned for all sorts of crazy twists!\n\nUpdates: Weekly, every Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Thanks for the critique!! Yeah, rev exchanges are really fun to do, and also rewarding! I’ve already chosen a new, and I hope permanent, font for Chapter 2, so I’m on the way to edit the whole Chapter 1  \n\nLet’s get down to the review! \nI’ve just finished reading all your comic, it looks pretty good!! I really like the path the story is taking with all the trime-traveler scheme and Harper tired of her ordinary life. Even though this is just the beginning of the comic it just opens so many doors to different plot lines around other times that I can’t wait to see!!\nAbout the art, I think the monochromatic scheme you’re using suits your comic very well, mainly cause I associate black and white with different times. The anatomy is well studied and worked, the only thing I’d say is that some action scenes look a little stiff, maybe if you used some movement distortion, motion blur or even by just exaggerating more the movement it would look better. \nI’m not usually into pages with more than 5/6 panels, but in your case it looks good since it gives a chaotic and quick feeling to the fight scenes. It’s just my opinion as someone who makes exaggeratedly big pannels, so don’t take it by heart XD\nI LOVE the way you do the lettering, it looks super smooth, nice and pro! Also the characters are, as far as I have seen, pretty unique and different from each other, something which I really appreciate cause it really annoys me when all the characters act and talk the same way.\nOverall I really like how you’re doing it, can’t wait to see more!!', 'Thanks for the amazing review!! Though I don’t know what do you mean about pace (English isn’t my first language so... ). Maybe is true that I should do less detailed backgrounds sometimes XD. Also sorry for taking so long, here’s my review!\n\nI’m not usually into comics without some fantasy or sci-fi thing, but yours looks really promising! The strange rumors  that cover Rudy’s detention at the beginning of your comics really picked my attention when I started reading it, now I can’t wait to know what Renée is going to say in the next episode. \nArt wise, your style looks consistent and coherent. I don’t see any big anatomy mistakes even though I’ve seen some poses which are more difficult to draw, maybe sometimes the proportions can look a little bit weird (for example, in the last episode Renee’s arms look way too thin the first time she appears), but these are just in small things. Also I’d try to put a little more detail when drawing backgrounds, sometimes they look too empty so I think they’d look better by adding more elements. They don’t need to be perfectly drawn, just to fill empty space.\nAbout the coloring, I like the way you use screentones instead our just using black and white but sometimes it gets a little confusing when I see one panel with so many different tones next to eachother. I’d suggest to use different types of screentone textures, maybe one with “smaller grains” (I don’t know how to say that) could look better on backgrounds. \nI really like the way you use the scroll format! It helps to create a good flow in each episode. The action itself looks amazingly clear and it’s easy to follow. The characters are pretty unique and with opposed personalities, something that I found very amusing, specially in their interactions with eachother.\nI really have enjoyed your work so far so I’ve subscribed to see more, can’t wait!', ""Thank you @Chita!! I'm glad you liked it so much and it makes me so happy that you both noticed and complimented me on how each character has it's own unique voice in the comic. That was/is the most important element of the comic to me is making sure the characters are distinct and true to themselves, so reading that you picked up on that is very validating!"", ""I like the colors, it's something that I lack and have no training on. I'm glad you changed the speech bubbles. Your overall style is developing and getting better. Practice makes perfect!"", 'OK here I go ^^\nStory:(+) The prologue was nicely done: not too much text and images to the point. A simple but deep enough introduction to give context to the story. However, after the intro (-) it took me a bit to get into the story, mostly because the beginning felt a bit too ""generic"" to me. Going to the market and being followed for some reason didn\'t get to me  . (+) You got my attention again with the scene of the crystals, when it became clear she was looking for something only she could perceive.\nArt:(+) Looking at the first pages and the last ones, you have clearly improved! I like the facial expressions of the characters, especially Flare\'s. I also enjoyed the color choices, especially in chapter 2; for example, I like how you adjusted the colors of the whole scene to make the Aster\'s wings or Flare\'s fire skill to pop out and make the drawing speak by itself. Action poses feel more natural in the latter pages, (-) but I think they still need improvement, especially the fight scenes; some felt a bit broken/interrupted. I do know it is hard to get a ""flow"" of images to tell a fight scene, I struggle a lot with this myself, but I know you\'ll get there!\nHope this somewhat helped :SWish you good luck with your studies!\n\nEdit:if you get a chance, here is my webcomic:\n\nwebtoons.com1\n\n\n\nTerra Prima\nA researcher, a collector of emotions, and a madman, are dragged into conspiracies and legends that span across the multiverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTapas link', ""First of all, thank you so much for the review and all the support you've given me \nHere's your review!STORYYou haven't submited many chapters yet, but as far as I have read the premise of the plot seems quite interesting. I like the way you've combined all the superpowers lore with the existence of multiple dimensions. I can't say much more about it cause you've just started, but I'm pretty interested to see how the story evolves! The only thing plot related that I'm not very fan of is that in the first chapter there are many big time skips in a short period. I know they're necessary to move the plot forward but I'd suggest to add more inbetween scenes so they look smoother.\nARTI like the characters' designs cause they look very unique, not only because their physical appeareance but also for the clothes they wear and their personality.I think that sometimes the expressions and poses look a little bit stiff, so I'd try to work a little on gesture drawing and maybe play with exaggerating emotions.Another thing I've noticed that you have many front view angles, I think it would look better if you dropped some cool perspective from time to time. It also can be used as a nice way to set the location of the scene! Hope that I could be of some help!!"", ""Yay! Thank you @Chita for the review! \nFirst of all I'm happy the story made sense, because so far the only people who have reviewed it are my friends who also created the story, so not much of a challenge there.\nYeah, I'm still working on movement and fluidity of the figures, as well as with perspective. Hope I'll get better over time.\nThanks again!"", ""Just caught up with Burning Shadows. Flare is cute, and the world looks interesting so far. I like how dragons and asters have different styles of magic. Actions scenes are well choreographed, I liked how Flare fought smart and kicked up dust to hide herself, but they feel a little flat and stiff at times.

503,Feedback For You,Reviews | Feedback,[],"I've been in the mood lately to give con-crit, so I thought I'd offer myself up
I'll read through at least 25 pages of a comic, 5000 words of a novel, and offer my reactions, including those of the more subjective kind. If you've improved significantly over the course of your comic/novel and don't want feedback on aspects you've long since improved or corrected, this may not be for you. Or you can ask me to start at a later chapter, but I won't necessarily be able to give thoughts on the narrative/plot. 
And a warning, I guess: I don't believe in giving mean-spirited criticism, but because I'm giving my personal reactions, you may not receive 'compliment sandwich' feedback. If I give criticism without compliments, that doesn't mean your work is without merit; the fact that you've created at all is impressive. It just means that the issues were such that I personally couldn't get enjoyment out of the work, and I can't get any enjoyment out of all kinds of things, 'cause I'm picky-picky.

My perspective is my own, and incomplete. (But if you want my thoughts on something specific, please ask!)I will provide feedback mostly on what I think I can provide useful advice on, or things that stood out to me as particularly worthy of note. I am not providing a totally objective, well-rounded, thorough review of every aspect of a work. My own values will influence my perspective, and you, and others, may not agree with me at all.
I'm looking at novels/comics from the perspective of someone who reads them for entertainment.Well, and as a fledgling wannabe creator myself second... Point is, your stuff is being put alongside professional media I've enjoyed when I look at it, as opposed to being necessarily judged based on your current skill level as a creator. 
Comic art and prose will be evaluated somewhat differently.While I will give tips about specific aspects of art that can be improved, I believe a lot of draftsmanship is just a matter of study and time. You can't advice someone into getting foreshortening right (if you can, please contact me 'cause I need help). Prose requires practice and observation, but it's also more easily improved by reading and advice. Prose is also, by its nature, more difficult to absorb than images. 
I am assuming you believe in yourself and your work, and are soliciting feedback from multiple sources (or will be).If not, you should do those things! I don't want my feedback for you to be treated as The One Single Truth About Your Work instead of one of many opinions you've solicited and evaluated for yourself. I also don't want to be responsible for you feeling like your work isn't worthwhile because I mostly focused on problems I felt could be fixed in my feedback. I'm just some rando on the internet. Why do you care what a jerk like me thinks about anything?

I'm saying it now, if you need it: your work is worthwhile. I'm proud of you for creating. Even if something isn't working out as well as you hoped, you're growing just by practicing.

"", 'At first, I wasn\'t compelled by the cliche aspect of the premise. Character is terrible at something, dreams of becoming that thing, and finally gets their chance. But execution is what matters, and I was pleased when he was wisked off into an alternate universe. It\'s also interesting to see that he actually  kinda...isn\'t ready for the responsibilities of being a ranger? He\'s got a romantic idea in his head about what the job involves, and though he\'s determined and enthusiastic, that doesn\'t mean he\'s ready for those tough responsibilities. (Is that something you\'re going to explore in the comic? I hope so!)\nEven though your characters are simple, none of them come off as flat.\n-Clearly defined characters that bounce off one another with strong desires.- Easy to follow actions, expressions, and dialogue-A brisk pace; something is happening in ever scene.\nIn short, I feel like this comic is clearly communicating endearing characters in an entertaining story. \n-Biggest big problem, for me, is also the easier to fix. The text in the dialogue bubbles is too large, and it looks like you\'re trying to compress words to get them to fit into the space. Also, there are grammar and spelling errors. \nI liked the proportion of text to dialogue bubble on this page, in the panel with the fox surrounded in smoke.\n\ntapas.io4\n\n\n\nTrip across the Multiverse :: Pages 7 - 12: Off to another world | Tapas\nTrip\'s calm job as a janitor turns to desperation after a mysterious explotion.\n\nNOTE: There\'s a BIG design change at the middle of the comic, please keep in mind it has been periodically updating in other sites. Check out the official site:...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-While you can\'t fix it now, I think the beginning could use more showing instead of telling. It doesn\'t have to be long (I appreciate how quickly you got to the main story). As a random example, instead of having Trip explain what a ranger is in a narration box, we could have seen him...I dunno, cutting pictures of heroic rangers from a newspaper from a magazine? Or it could have been explained a bit through dialogue (though not directly). ""A weakling like you would throw up just travelling to another dimension, much less saving one!""\n-Sometimes, your paneling is uneven like here\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nTrip across the Multiverse :: Chapter one - Page 34 | Tapas\nSo, fox guy now looks a bit different, in part to make him look more distinct both in his individual face and as a species, you can\'t see here, but the colors are a little different as well. What do you think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nTrip across the Multiverse :: Chapter one - Page 33 | Tapas\nPhew, yet another late page, sorry for that.\n\nI know darkness in these pages is a little inconsistent, but i\'m still figuring out how to do dark scenes while keeping the bright and colorful feel i\'m going for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying the space between panels and panel sizes can be fine, but when it\'s this close to being even, it looks more like a mistake than a proper stylistic choice.\n-As for backgrounds...you could use more of them? Maybe look into some of those 3D modelling programs for easier perspective. And lots of reference. Maybe look at Gunnerkrigg Court for a simple and cartoony background style inspiration? Though I think your comic wouldn\'t be suited to the rough, textured look Gunnerkrigg Court has.http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/?p=21\n-Don\'t be afraid to experiment with different perspectives and sizes of characters within the space, even for fairly static talking scenes.\n-Oh, and this may be sort of a a more subjective comment, but so far, of the four major characters we\'ve met, the one that comes off as a bit dull is Carmen. I think that there is sometimes a tendency in fiction for female characters to get stuck with a sort of...generic nice person role? She seems oddly subservient and uncertain for a detective, letting Harry walk over her. I guess I\'d have a hard time defining her character. What does she want? Harry seems to want to interrogate the fox more than her.\nThis is a cute, fun comic! This is one of those cases where, even though things can be improved, the core appeal of the comic shines through.', 'I would be very grateful if you could check mine \n\ntapas.io4\n\n\n\nBurning Shadows | Tapas\nIn a world where Asters and dragons are considered nothing more than myths, Flare, who seems to be kind of a dragon hybrid, wakes up with no memories.

I\'ll try to remember all of these when working on new pages.\nI don\'t want to just tell the whole point of the story right now, but it is (at least supposed to) have some more depth than what it seems at first, both charcters and story. It\'s not supposed to be all deep and philosophical, at it\'s core it\'s dumb fun, but i\'d like people to be able to enjoy it on different levels.\nAbout the text, i think i need an example of what you\'re talking about, like an especially bad instance of the problem in the comic itself. About grammar and spelling errors, i\'d be awesome if you could tell me where they are to fix them right now, i\'ll double check myself anyways.\nI do plan to fix the first pages at some point, so i\'ll try to do more of what you\'re saying here.\nI never considered ""almost even"" panels would look more like a mistake, but it actually makes a lot of sense it would seem like that, so i\'ll try to avoid it.\nI have started using 3D modeling programs for backgrounds, and i need a lot more dynamic angles and stuff, but i don\'t feel confident enough in my skill, i\'ll try tough.\nThanks for everything!

I see you are making some really detailed reviews here, this is some great help!', ""@MinNCompany \nOkeydokey, this is a romance, and I'm a reader of romance.

But I said this was gonna be from my subjective point of view, and my subjective point of view you shall get.\nAs I ended up reading from the beginning, an issue hung over me as I was reading and dampened my enjoyment of the rest of the story. This was the issue of contrivance. I get the impression that the idea of two characters being required to sleep together for warmth due to another character's illness came first, then the attempts to make that situation plausible. While that's how a lot of writing works, in this case, the explanations for how the situation ended up being what it was were not sufficient for me. \nKyung is cold at night due to her 'medicine'. The first logical solution is to light a fire, and it feels too convenient that the king just happens to have a severe phobia of fires, and glowing plants exist to provide light after dark in this world. This brings up a great deal of questions about how the castle is run. Are those baths of cold water? And if this were the case, it almost certainly would have been noticed by Azael and commented on before meeting Kyung. \nThere's also the fact that there are easier solutions to the problem than getting a strange, unknown servant to sleep in Kyung's bed at night. A servant that has known Kyung all their life, Kyung's father... The most practical and preferable solution would be the acquisition of a bunch of large, fluffy dogs to pile on the bed at night.\nThen there's The Big One: Why was Kyung mutilated? Because the King was going to kill her? Why? The only answer seems to be that, because she was a female, she couldn't inherit the throne, but that's not a reason to kill a female child. A princess is still a princess, even if she will never become queen of the land, in the vast majority of cultures. There are circumstances in which this could be more plausible, but none of them are spelled out.\nThere are other tidbits that make it harder to believe in the world of the story. Kyung says, early on, that Azael must find royalty despicable for their wealth. But Kyung has been raised as royalty, a wealthy prince, likely taught all her life that she deserved this wealth, and taken it as her due.  It's not impossible that a person of royal blood might be sympathetic to wealth inequalities, but it's definitely an unusual trait. And there seems to be an overall...lack of formality, between servants/slaves and their superiors in this world. Kyung's father giving advice about feelings to Azael, Azael's occasional boldness with royalty.\nAnd this is where another big dollop of subjectivity comes in. I'm not really sure I can invest in these characters. They're very...hmm, how do I put this. Passive. Mild. This seems like the sort of romance I might enjoy in a fanfic between two characters I already enjoy, but not with two characters I don't know outside of the context of this story.\nThe more I think about it, the more I come around to the issue of passivity. Neither of them wants to be in the situation they're in. It was engineered by Prince Irean. Kyung doesn't reveal her secret to Azael; Azael overhears it accidentally. Prince Irean pushes Azael to reveal his backstory to Kyung.  Kyung makes some efforts to get people to treat Azael with respect, but the implication is that she has no power despite being a prince to prevent this. The King is going to force her to marry a woman. And I skipped way down in the comic, and it looks like Azael is freed from the dungeon by a rebellion. \nPassive characters who endure their lot can be interesting, but making that work is a lot harder than adhering to more conventional popular storytelling structures. Proactive characters who pursue what they want with all of their might are inherently compelling, even when they're awful human beings. Even otherwise interesting characters can be difficult to get invested in if they aren't doing much.\nI guess the big questions are, what do the characters what? How are they tring to get it? What's at stake if they fail?  I think trying to answer these questions will show there really isn't much going on in terms of conflict.\nOkay! Moving on!\nThis may be bias, but I think traditional comic fonts in opaque white bubbles is the best way to go.\nThe character anatomy is great. Expressions and tender moments are handled well. \nBackgrounds, though, could use work, along with clothing design. I know characters can wear anything in a fantasy world, but when it looks like they are wearing contemporary t-shirts, I don't really get a fantasy feel. Rooms also tend to be barren, though some of the perspective work is great.\n\n\ntapas.io6\n\n\n\nNoblex :: 32 | Tapas\nKyung is a prince in disguise. Azael is a servant with a secret.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis episode has a great outdoor scene in the beginning, but for the interior scene, there's nothing but a muddled brown \nMy favorite parts of the comic included Azael's backstory, specifically his relationship with the abusive Reijin, and the scene where Gina gives him a drink after his suicide attempt, and he begings to cry. Veryll well drawn emotional moments."", 'Lovely! Far more in depth than expected, much thanks to you ^^', ""@MinNCompany , Hope it's useful!

Mere decades after the end of the Great War in the Air the world finds itself in the midst of a second Great War--a war in which gods and men-like gods shake the very foundations of reality with their combat. 
The rise of superhumanity and supertechnology has expanded Earth's war to the far corners of reality. There is no end in sight to the conflict. With each new miracle comes several new nightmares. The fires of war grow and threaten to consume all existence.
After a battle in Europe against an Axis energy dragon, a superhuman named Spectro tumbles through uncharted reality--and something follows him back home to Earth, something with strange thoughts and incredible power.
This is the tipping point. This is point of no return.

For a time, I was admin of a fairly popular Facebook page for public domain superheroes before I turned away from Facebook. I might have read all the original Fletcher Hanks stories.\nAs I mentioned in the Elevator Pitch thread, you hooked me, but only a niche audience has even heard of this guy. If that is your target audience, then you're off to a great start. If you want a larger audience, you should maybe cast a wider proverbial net.\nYour artwork is astounding to me. Some might criticize it for being a little over-the-top, but to my mind, that is appropriate for this story. The characters are interesting thus far if a little lacking in diversity. The action depicted is clear. The decision to go strictly grayscale is -- okay. A few images, like that cover up there, I would have liked to have seen in maybe a monochromatic wash. I'm not really sure what I want because I'm not a visual art guy.\nThe dialog is above average.\nThe pacing is problematic. You have several pages in a row of (I'll call it) esoteric technobabble. It was sort of a chore to get through that part. You are setting the tone very well, but after it's been set, I don't see a reason to keep wallowing in the existential weirdness. I read the entire series to get caught up, taking me at least half an hour. The title character still has not appeared in the story. That's a problem. In Moby Dick, Ahab didn't appear for several chapters, but the others characters wouldn't stop dropping his name until he did show up, so Ahad appeared by proxy. Stardust is just plain late to his own comic.\nOverall, I think it's fair to say that I am hooked and looking forward to the rest of the series."", ""Thank you for the review!

Moontachi Gaiden | Tapas
""Please read from left to right"" 

The story follows a hopeless student, two criminals and an estranged chef determined to make a name for themselves in this cosmopolitan world.  

A seinen action series set back during the 1980s.

Features:...





","[""I check out the video and there is only so many way you can do a slide show style video after all but I'll give you my pointers, but first, what programs was use to make it? Since some of the stuff I am about to mention might be hard to accomplish based on the program, here is my take:\nThe intro has a cool animated style with the logo and then is transition to a really retro (80's style) background so is kind of weird. I rather the logo would had vanish or 'flipped' to the 'what is it?' and then the other text would fade into this while the triangle shower is still going AND then is transition into the slide with Alistor.\nNever use the 'spiral out' kind of effect for long sentences as it looks a bit weird, try more subtle effect such as wipe out or fade. The text of 'The story follows a hopeless student' didn't actually need that animation. Just have the entire slide do a transition (moving to the side to reveal something behind it are quite popular).\nThe time window to read text is sometimes a bit to fast (I can read it, but as rule of thumb I add 2 seconds more from my reading time and I tend to read it outloud as if someone is saying it to measure a bit of speed of easy reading). I like the slide effect as to give an overview of the comic and pages.\nThere are other miscelanous thing that can be fix (text placement, font, speed of some of the slide) but I think the details on top are what I can say will make the video better. First impression in a kickstarter are important and reason I am giving a stronger feedback as oppose to if this was a promotion video for the series in tapas (the fixes could still apply there too).\nIf you need any help on making video let me know, unlike comic at least making videos I know a thing or two xP"", 'Alright, so I\'m going to be a little harsh. Brace yourself...\nThe biggest issue I see is that the video seems like an info dump, and yet, I feel like I still don\'t really know what the story is about after viewing it. It\'s just busy looking. Most of this can also be equated to editing. Even with the most basic of video editing software, you can get it to look simpler and crisper. But part of it is also the hodgepodge of panels all spliced together in the same frame. The brain can only register so much at once.\nSo my advice would be:\n\nDon\'t display more than one comic panel on the screen at once.\nDo not have paragraphs of info about the comic.\nText/image animations should be kept simple (fade-ins, etc.)\nThe font should be easy to read.\n\nAnother important thing: don\'t waste time. And by that, I mean, skip the whole: ""What is it?"" spiel at the beginning. We should first be thrown into the world and the characters. Don\'t talk about genre. We should be able to tell the genre from the plot. You did a good job of keeping the video about 2 minutes long. It shouldn\'t be any longer. But the casual viewer/potential reader needs to be grabbed almost instantly.\nI think more than anything, you would benefit from making a more cinematic trailer.\nHere\'s an example of a webcomic trailer I think was done incredibly well. GhostBlade can also be read here on Tapas.\nIndie Comic GhostBlade Trailer\nA few things to consider:\n\nThe GhostBlade trailer was very long. It doesn\'t ever need to be that long.\nThat being said, the trailer featured voice lines for one of the main characters, which immediately draws my attention more.\nThe large panning images from the comic are way more mesmerizing. (Art style aside, you should pick the panels that really show off the art of your comic. Choose the panels that are striking, that might have interesting angles of perspective, or bold expressions.)\nMake sure you have permission to use the music you use. It will seem more professional.\nAnd most importantly, give us a reason to want to read your comic. Like any pitch, you need a few key elements: Who is the main character(s)? What do they want? What are the stakes? How will they get it? What obstacles lie in their path?\n\nI\'ll try and put up a base trailer for my comic as an example later, to show more what I mean.', 'Glad you manage to give an example, I search for one but came empty O_O Voice narration does work wonders for that promotion and the music is perfect with the art (plus the editing of the images moving along to the music is a great way to go about doing a slide show).\nHope to see your base trailer as you have quite a nice comic (Whispers of the past).', 'Took me longer to finish than I was anticipating, but it was a good exercise.\nWhispers of the Past: (Webtoon - Webcomic) Trailer 1', ""That is really good, love the particle effect with the flame. Only thing is that for the moving effect don't start it or stop it the moment image fades in or out, have it be in movement before it starts to fade in and have it keep moving after it starts to fade out.\nIt stopping or starting abrutly feels a bit weird. Outside of that great music, nice transitions and love the smoke behind text effect  Great voice overs too!"", ""Lol, I wasn't posting it for critique, but thanks, haha. I was having a hard time getting the transitions to work for me in Premiere. I know another way to do it, but it would require a bunch more video channels. Anyway, I'm going to make another one in the future when I have more pages done."", ""I know it wasn't for critique xP But thought I pointed that out for future videos. Is not a break it thing as the video is still great!\nIf ever need suggestion on Premiere let me know, is what I use for my work (Adobe Premiere and After Effect that is)."", ""Hi there! I've watched your video and now have a couple of words to say about it.\nGood things first: + I love the logo at the beginning and effects related to it. Everything looks cool there!+ First slides with the characters are pretty nice, too.+ Music is mostly very good and suitable for this kind of video+ Slides with one picture on it look good\nNow criticism... (please don't be sad about it! Just consider and remember that I'm just a random spectator and I'm not fully objective for sure  ):- Slides with several pictures on it looks messy and overloaded with information. All these text bubbles and small details... I had no chance to understand what's going on there- Font between some slides is too simple and boring for my taste. It can be improved without a great effort. Just changing the font and adding shadow, for example, can help.- I didn't fully get the personalities of characters presented in this video. Maybe there are pages in the comics, where they are a bit more expressive?- I didn't understand the plot of comics either. I think this video has the potential to be more clear and informative! - At the end of the video music breaks too abruptly... It seems like duration of the video and duration of the music are too much different.- The transition from comics pages to real life video record was also too abrupt for me. Please consider making this transition smoother somehow.\nHope this feedback was helpful for you.. \nHere is my comics:\n\ntapas.io\n\n\n\nThe story of how humanity has thrown itself into the scrapyard  | Tapas\nTwo cynic cyborgs - killer (guy) and hacker (girl) are trying to get answers in the hostile world.\n\nWARNING: strong language, violence and nudity\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd greatly appreciate if you check it!""]",9/26/2018 12:15,https://forums.tapas.io/t/video-promo-for-my-teams-comic-ill-check-your-comic-manga-for-sub/27477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Puppie and Sheep | Tapas
The daily life of two bisexual people in a long distance relationship, struggling to meet each other.





","[""So... I read your comic during my 10 minute break since it was a short and easy read...\nI do like the concept of a long distance relationship in a story. I can appreciate that your art is steadily getting better with each update, and one strip actually did make me giggle (the one about updating, but it only worked for me cause I can directly relate).\nAs far as the comic itself while it was really difficult for me to stay focused on a lot of the comics due to spelling and grammar it wasn't impossible to read, it just felt like some pages were like tumblr/tweet logs. Spelling can be excusable at times, but sometimes it was very obvious and not easily ignored even for me. I'm not sure if you're going for slice of life or strict comedy/romance. If it's a slice of life I don't really know anything about either characters even to the basics of what their personalities are. I get that they're bisexuals, the first comic made that clear with the penis joke. Perhaps if the audience had more time to understand who Puppy and Sheep are as individuals that joke may have made more sense to readers. If it's a comedy it really feels like a lot of the jokes are inside jokes that only people who personally know you might understand rather than any audience person reading for the first time, which goes back to character development being another important reason to build on, I mean a little brother shows up out of nowhere before the reader really knows who Sheep is her/himself.\nI don't think it's bad, just kind of lost at the moment. I don't want you to feel discouraged, I just feel honesty is the best thing I can give you as someone who has had trouble finding the right direction to take my own work. Don't give up, and do your best! I feel your audience will feel more engaged if you really work on opening up your characters more, and read your strips out loud if you need to.\nGood luck "", 'Wow, thanks! It doesent discourages me at al, dont worry.  First tip is that english is not my frst language and im messy as hell . True is that the wole thing is a slice of life with bits of romance and comedy. Is an extremelly personal proyect cause all the jokes are actual things that happen. I totally need to think more in the build of the characters.The exitement of making it makes the rest totally fly over my head. I will try to take in mind your words and do my best. Thanks for your honesty!', ""I really like your story, the only thing I recommend is maybe a story on how they met online (besides the blog episode thing) and go into details on how they got so close. And remember you don't need to post a page everyday, most audiences like longer pages with less updates (quality over quantity thing) Maybe update 1-2 times a week rather then everyday (Plus, less stress on you!) \nAnyways really liked your comics, and I subscribed!

Your comic is adorable, I love their chemistry. It is incredible they have such a strong bond while they are so far away. I love this type of relationship. As a personal preference, I think they could look better with a thicker line art. Of course, you chose what works for you. Overall I like the simple panels with a bright color on the background. One thing that I get was that you were encouraging questions since the first pages but we don't really know anything about them so far. Authors are familiar with their characters but the audience isn't (at least at the beginning).

Im glad you enjoyed my comic though ', 'Okay, done with the legend of the black scales. Your story seems interesting, shame is no more than two pages to read. I just can add that you need to think in some consistency in your draws. For example, the ship looks like a 3d generated and in comparation the black and withe little girl looks really flat. And having a flat black and withe character hide in a colored barrel looks a little odd. But The first page looked really goon and i would like to know where its going! Good luck!', 'There is so much episodes i have not finished yet to read it  . For the artistic part i can advice some more interesting shots in your episodes and it would be great to see more textures in the draws. If you look into profesional manga artist, the black and withe with textures and rich backgrounds make a lot more interesting to look at. Thats all the advice i can give for now!', ""Thanks a lot for the advice. don't worry everything will change soon. The new don't look anything like this XD  Definitely right!"", ""Hey, I'm read your comic and it's cool. Your art is really good, I like it for real. Story is great too, I'm always had interest to how people can manage relationshps when they're far away from RL meet. Keep going and everything will be great \nAlso if you want to check my work here it is. https://tapas.io/series/TUM_ER1.(I'm a bit drunk right now, and I hope I didn't made a lot mistakes in grammar  ). And your comic is really great!"", ""Hi. \nFirst of all, I want to say about good things briefly:+ Characters are cute+ Stories are:++ fun++ easy to understand++ related to real-life everyday problems, so they really seems like a slice of life\nNow, some criticism:- Fonts:-- font size in the dialogs and the arrangement of the texts in the bubbles varies greatly. It makes the reading somewhat uncomfortable-- pink font at the end of each page makes me feel uncomfortable (too bright), but maybe it is just my perception- Links at the end of each strip are part of the image, so they are not clickable. It is unlikely that the reader will reprint them in the address bar. People are lazy, you know. It would be better to give the same links clickable somewhere (in description, probably).- Also I agree with person who said that your characters could be revealed more. For example, you could draw more strips revealing their hobbies and work.\n\nAnd this is my comics:\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nThe story of how humanity has thrown itself into the scrapyard  | Tapas\nTwo cynic cyborgs - killer (guy) and hacker (girl) are trying to get answers in the hostile world.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that it could be hard to understand what's going on here, but I'd greatly appreciate to see review for it, too. Especially I'd like to understand what is clear, and what is not clear enough from the plot and probably how to improve my drawing style and scene composition "", 'Hey dear! just checked your comic , i will just point soem suff:The fronts: sometimes make it dificult to read, Have more consistency on them. better you retouch all to have the same front always.Coloring: I have no idea what is your painting program but there is a lot of paint holes in your coloring, even if you dont know how to make texture or light effect some nice plain paint will be better. Your actual coloring makes all look ""Dirty"" and not good  finished.The draw: You know? you dont need great draws for a good story, but you do need a lot of effort. I recomend you practise as much as you can and your comic will inprove a lot! I recomend you Krita, is 100 % free and has all the tools for a good comic.Good things: You actually manage to try lots of backgrounds and i think is notisable you try hard! Dont get discouraged, i will be cheking your comic from time to time and i wait good things from it!', 'Welp, yes: I have no idea whats hapening hahaha. I assume you are gonna clarify a lot of things at some moment. I can see your style has a lot of consistency and thats really good.To improve: Expression. Not only the character faces are too static in the same explession,the actions scenes too. I recomend you to look at facial expressions and movement line work to understand what i say. EXAGERATE IS THE KEY (example, that dude has been shot, he must be in pain and extremelly pissed, but his face looks just middly surpriced?)Other thing is absolutelly everything has the same texture, you can maybe try to save that for some particular parts of your work, and also make linearts more thick in the right places.Thats all i can add for now. Good luck and keep going!', ""I been following you on facebook and always found your strip cute and charming. Didn't know you had them in tapas so I'll give it a more proper feedback.\nI am glad you are doing a story arc of how you two met as it is an important part for readers to get to know the characters more and find a deeper connection with them. Some strips do go over ones head as one has no clue or info necessary to understand. This is not bad all the time as sometimes there are inside jokes and in the future readers will get them more as they learn more about the character and their circumstances, but when the comic is just starting is a bit hard.\nAs for the art I think some change on line art (thickness and so on) can really help out. I do like the style going for it in the cartoonish chibi like style. The various expression are really cute and funny, my favorite ones till now are the actual one with sheep and dog, they are cute and easy to relate to.\nI do suggest fixing grammar on the title of the strip as seeing 'Beginning' constantly misspell and then have one have the correct spelling looks weird. I did read about english not being your main language but I suggest passing the dialogue thru a correction app if you can't find someone to read it first as some errors are really easy to catch (extra letter or missing letter in words, wrong place for the letter, etc, etc). There are more complex thing that it might not catch if is an app, but that is more for someone being able to read it.\nOverall I like it as it gives a nice warm feeling, is cute and short so easy to read \nMine sadly only as the prologue for now, but would love for you to check it out and hopefully be able to review it more once the actual first chapter is out.\n https://tapas.io/series/BRA1"", ""Hi there!The thing that caught my eye (I'm more of an artist than a writer, so that's what I'll focus on):Like others have said, I think the comic could benefit from having thicker and smoother lines. I think you're using traditional pen to make the lines (if I'm looking at it correctly), perhaps using a thinner brush-pen could help with lining.\nI think a combination of doing thinner pen lines for background objects, and thicker brush pen lines for characters would help create definition for your panels.\nFor the 'ending card' of your comic, maybe instead of a list of links, if there was a way you could dynamically display the links (maybe in boxes? stronger-colored font?) it would help follower interaction. Also, for some reason the font seems to be fuzzy; is this a resizing issue? It would probably benefit you to fix the fuzziness.\nI commend you on your improvement throughout the length of the comic, and the variety of expressions! Best of luck! \nHere's my comic:\n\nwebtoons.com2\n\n\n\nAlpha Low\nYuna Son, an average millionaire college student, must train with her helicopter butler, pacifistic bodyguard, and narcissistic advisor in a battle against Heaven, Earth, and Hell to secure her throne and spread the word of capitalism.\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'Hi there I\'m recently new here and, I just checked out your comic since it caught my interest. I really like the concept you are going for. Plenty can relate to the long distance relationship dilemma. From what I see, this can also work as a fun short animated skit.

The Primordial B Plus :: Chapter 1 | Tapas
An unexpected visitor does something unexpected





Hi, I'm new here and would like opinions and advice on my comic book (the art gets better as you go). Thanks!","[""I like your art style, its unique and you're effective at designing characters. You could probably take this even further by experimenting with more distinct silhouettes in your character designs. Your background work is great, especially the detail you put into the scenes set in Greece!\nStory-wise I liked the premise behind it, but I think you might have lost momentum because of the narration. It led to a lot of instances where you were showing and not telling. Comics are really about showing over telling as much as possible and I think you are talented enough artistically to use this more to your advantage. \nCouple of examples: Instead of telling us that Raj escaped from the mysterious large people when he was infiltrating the corporation you could show us a sweet action scene where he barely makes it out. Or the story could begin with the professor doing the coin flip, but then there's a risk of them being discovered so they rush to the car earlier and then the exposition is broken up a bit with action scenes, to balance out some of the more intellectual story-telling. That being said I really liked how much you incorporated (I'm assuming) your academic background to it, it made it a lot more grounded and interesting.\nCongratulations on finishing this piece! I think you have a lot of awesome tools that you will be able to carry on to the next one. "", 'Thanks so much for your advice and for taking the time to read! I will definitely try to take your ""show don\'t tell"" advice in the future.\nBTW, your own comic is great, and is very difficult to stop reading once you\'ve started!', ""You're welcome, and thank you so much haha.

 like sucess you know, and I strongly believe that to receive something good I should give something of equal value.
I've seen some people post other comic's banners on theirs, and I'd like to be part of that move, but since the value of UNDERCOPPER for cross-promotion is still low I thought about something better. 
I'll give you a review in exchange for my banner and link to be on your comic 
Some of you might have seen how my reviews are. Detailed and accordinly to the artist skill level. Tough but polite. and I even give you the option to have it on private message or in public on this thread
So go ahead, it's a win - win  situation. 
I'll make a new slick banner, so to participate just do the next things:
-Ask for the new sloppy chocolate awesome and sweet banner-State if Public or Private  (to know where to post the review)-Post the link to your Comic-Update your last page with the  new banner and post the link to undercopper on the description with an alusive Text
I dunno for how long would be fair to let the banner be there on your work, so we could discuss that on PM, 
Once I have my review done I'll let you know here, but I'll only post it if the publicity has been spread on said comic (i'll notice xD i'll be reading your stuff to make the Review, Duh)
NOTE: I won't be taking novels, only comics (English isn't my native language and neither i'm a writter, so my skills to critiq a novel wouldn't do justice to your work, maaaybe if it was in spanish, otherwise only comics guys, plss, and thanks for your time)

River and the parallel worlds
River, a frequent party drunkard finds herself thrown into space with hazy memories. She then encountered an android terrorist named Dee as they embark an adventure to find River's home.

Some of them looks really weird.- Characters themself are fun, but... you know, they remind me anime cliches about tsundere and about robots at this point. I hope that they will revealed deeper at some moment, they have potential for that.\nAnd this is my original character:\n  \n', ""Thanks! I didn't notice that my 2nd chapter was a bit stagnant but I'll keep that in mind for the future chapters.\nAlso I hope you don't mind my work? I skipped over the cap cause I needed to practice doing hair.\n\nisaiah.jpg1050x1200 745 KB\n"", 'Salutations!\nWell I read through what you have so far and I\'ve some feedback for you as per your request. \nArt: I think the art is great, you\'ve got a very smooth style and a texture that feels very much like it belongs in an animated film. You keep your character on model and your lines are very smooth, so it all comes across as a strong work in the art department. I enjoy the use of shapes in the back ground characters that contrast them with Dee and River. I also appreciate that your comic isn\'t just a sequence of shot, reverse-shot. You have movement either by having a character grab their head, make a half twist or swing their legs of a bench. There\'s always some kind of movement that keeps the art feel alive so, kudos that\'s really awesome.\nPacing: First I\'ll say this, I\'m glad you started in the action. You have a brief scene between River and Dee and bam, right into a fight. It was a good way to start and set the tone and the energy for the rest of what you have up so far. Now overall you\'ve got a snappy pace to your story and this is good. It\'ll save you from dragging through scenes and keep your audience on their toes. Some parts of the pacing sometimes feel upended, however because a scene has to stop for River to make a comment. In the very first fight scene, five of the panels/shots were dedicated to a gag about River fearing she might be pregnant, when Dee is expecting her to throw the gun back to him. I actually thought this was funny but, the scene having to stop so she could make the joke and it felt like Dee would\'ve already been punched in the face at that point.\nYou\'re actually great with visual gags, so my only recommendation in this scenario would be to up the ante with the fight. For instance if Dee had been throttled and really needed her help while she was complaining, all the while his situation grows worse, it would\'ve kept the scene feeling like it was in motion (and still went along with the humor you invoked). You\'re great at keeping things in motion, so this is just a small suggestion of how you can keep that momentum and make your joke, without stalling the momentum for the joke. It would also make Dee\'s punchline at the end of that scene that much more of a burn, because his peril had increased.\nMy advice is to think about the number of panels you\'re going to use to tell a joke and see if you can utilize the scene/background/environment etc. for the jokes best benefit. The best part about visual mediums is sharing visual humor and you\'re already pretty good at it so, that\'d be my recommendation there.\nHumor: I find the humor pretty genuine. Your main characters have a good type of snarky chemistry between them that works. One of the caveats I have in regards to the humor is this: make sure that your sexual humor isn\'t mostly concentrated on River. Now yeah, there were a few jokes about Dee that were sexual and they were funny, and many of the jokes around River are funny, however, innuendos always concentrated around a single character tend to wear over time. Think of all the stereotypical guys in horror movies who are only in it for the prospect of sex. We all groan and roll our eyes when that archetype comes on screen because all the jokes are done to death and nothing new can come from it, so it becomes lazy writing.\nI don\'t think you\'re anywhere near that level but, it\'s something to bear in mind. If all the jokes around River are more concentrated on sex most of the time, they\'ll lose their punch and become expected after a point. One of the things your comic has going for it is that it feels more unexpected and even if you\'re using jokes that have been done, you\'ve made them happen in such a way that they\'re still fresh and a good laugh. I also didn\'t anticipate the gags so they were a nice surprise. (That bit with Dee trying to ditch cops by busting down a wall to find a room full of them, made me laugh. I loved it. No matter how much he\'s razzed River, he\'s muddled things up just as much and that dig at his expense really worked.) I\'d just look out for the overuse of jokes so they don\'t go stale, and then invoking referential humor sparingly (which, I don\'t think you\'ll have a problem there, you have strong writing chops).\nDialogue: It flows well and it doesn\'t slow down the stories pace, you don\'t have a bunch of word bubbles with walls of text in them so you\'re doing fine there. I did notice this bit here that I think you might need to reword because I had to read it a couple of times. In #5 Dee says this: ""I wasn\'t the one sprinting off the bar with that being."" I wasn\'t sure if this was due to Dee himself, as previously he didn\'t seem to muddle his words. My first thought was that it would be ""I wasn\'t the one sprinting out of the bar with that being."" So, it might be something you\'d want to reword unless it\'s a quirk of Dee\'s. \nAll in all, I think your comic is a lot of fun. It\'s charming, your main characters have charisma and I\'m interested to see where it goes next. I hope that the feedback I have for you is useful and I wish you luck with your work. \nIf you have enough slots and if you have time, I\'d like to see a bust drawn of this character if possible and I thank you in advance regardless. It\'s a lot of work to make OC pictures in exchange for feedback, so I appreciate your effort. \n\nkhloe_dupont_by_syn_cypher-dc8qrc7.png800x920 808 KB\n', ""Thanks!

I haven\'t had this detailed feedback ever??? Also thanks for noticing that one dialogue of Dee, it must\'ve slipped by, and I probably was thinking that same dialogue ""I wasn\'t the one sprinting out of the bar with that being"" so if you don\'t mind I\'d replace that bubble with that same line.\nI hope this art is deserving of your critique, Thanks!!\nkhloe.jpg1050x1200 523 KB\n', 'Sure thing, best of luck!And thank you so so much for the beautiful artwork!

Moontachi Gaiden | Tapas
The story follows a hopeless student, two criminals and an estranged chef determined to make a name for themselves in this cosmopolitan world.  

A seinen action series set back during the 1980s.

Features: Loads of silly schemes, campy plots,...





Thanks for taking a look:)","['prettty very pretty indeed', ""It's pretty good; the characters have great proportions, their expressions are interesting, the text is also big enough to be read.\nHowever since this is a seinen manga, I would prefer it to be more impactful.Let's take panels 1-12 for example.-Rather than zooming into the antagonist, I think it would shape the atmosphere more if you draw them from far away, framing the landscape and ambience of the scene (what does the setting look like? What's in the surrounding land? What's the weather? etc.)-It's never bad to have a progressive story, but linger on certain scenes to make it feel more dramatic.The lady was shocked that the sacred sword was tainted, so make a lingering a shot on the sword as he raises it up to define its change.And if I may be honest, I didn't really understand what happened when the man brought his sword down until I read the next panel. I think it would've been better if you'd shown us the a landscape view of the ground crumbling, then the debris floating up, then just the scene of the two people talking to each other.\nGood luck!"", 'Thank you very much:) Greatly apprecciated', ""It's very nice.  I like the style of your comic.  It definitely matches what you're trying to aim for, and proportions are good as well.  The story is pretty good and easy to follow, however I do have some issues with the pacing.  There are certain scenes where you can linger for 1 or 2 small panels for effect.  Another thing you can do is to exaggerate certain panels in an action scene like when Grass Horn was breaking through the door.  You can do an extreme close up of the blade breaking through the door for dramatic effect.\nOther than those small issues, you have a great story here.

What you'll see? An action/comedy based comic based on the missadventures of police officers who don't understand what self preservation means.
Note: In my reviews  I always point two aspects with a pluss.
-Artwork-Storytelling-Pluss (Sometimes is overall design, sometimes is comunity engaging or something I forgot to add in the other sections)","[""(EXCHANGE)\nSo, that what I can say about your comics:Artwork:It is good mostly, but pictures with foreshortening from the bottom up and from other unusual angles are not so good. Movement dynamics are well drawn (if object is moving, it's trajectory is clear). Face of the girl cop (new partner of Johnson, from the beginning of the chapter #2) on the different pictures is not the same sometimes. For example, I still don't sure if a girl from the cover of the comics is the same to the girl from the beginning of the chapter #2 (but she should be, from the logic)Storytelling:Story is fun and clear (but is too short for this moment  )Pluss:There are a lot of stories about the cops already, including fun stories and comedies. So you should be really original to stand out from others. Characters, jokes and story itself should probably have more unusual and peculiar features to draw attention of the random reader.\nThis is my comics:\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nThe story of how humanity has thrown itself into the scrapyard  | Tapas\nTwo cynic cyborgs - killer (guy) and hacker (girl) are trying to get answers in the hostile world.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that it could be hard to understand what's going on here, but I'd greatly appreciate to see review for it, too. Especially I'd like to understand what is clear, and what is not clear enough from the plot and probably how to improve my drawing style and scene composition "", ""\n\ntired_programmer:\nbut pictures with foreshortening from the bottom up and from other unusual angles are not so good\nI know, gotta use photo reference for those dinamic angles next time.\n\n\ntired_programmer:\nace of the girl cop (new partner of Johnson, from the beginning of the chapter #2) on the different pictures is not the same sometimes.\nI've just noticed,  maybe making a character sheet would help with that (I had those for Johnson and Anderson)\n\n\ntired_programmer:\nI still don't sure if a girl from the cover of the comics is the same to the girl from the beginning of the chapter #2 (but she should be, from the logic)\nGood bless  logics, and that means there's good story telling even within the cover :DD \n\n\ntired_programmer:\nThere are a lot of stories about the cops already, including fun stories and comedies.

Characters, jokes and story itself should probably have more unusual and peculiar features to draw attention of the random reader.\nThat's both an advantage and disadvantage, meaning there's a lot refereral sources to get relatable material, but also as you say make it challenging to stand out in that same niche, is good to know that I should be a little bit more over the top, and well, I have few things under my sleves for next chapters.\nThanks a lot for your review, I'll check out your thingyly thingy thing and let you know once my review is ready for delivering! xd se ya around Tired Programer, this Tired Graphic Designer salutes you."", 'I got your review, let me know where do you want it, here in this Thread or on your private wall, or as a private message', 'This thread will be the right place for it!', ""Cool, hope I haven't been too though, take things with a thick skin and remember the goal is to improve.\nConcerning to artwork:It's smooth and there's a lot of room to improve. Gotta work on anatomy. sometimes characters seems to be ragdolls, and fight scenes lacks intensity, need to aim for extreme and dinamic angles, otherwise it seems very flat, flatter than average dialogue, and if that happens there's no point to have fight scenes. Faces are well defined and discernible even though I think you could go the extra mile adding some wrinkles and exagerating a bit the expresions, even though I believe is the best thing related to artwork in this comic.\nBackgrounds, background elements seems to cliche and sloppy, would be nice to enhance the perspective work in there, actually if you used refrence for those even if that would mean ripping off the original, would do wonders, y advice here would be to make your own photo references with your cellphone (if possible) or ask friends to make you that favor of taking pictures to landscapes, buildings and sidewalks, believe me it will do wonders for your backgrounds, I personally don't do this but I know for a fact many artist do that, Bryan O'malley the creator of Scott Pilgrim did it a lot.\nAnd finally color, color palette is somewhat nice, has certain harmony, but above that it's not doing anything else, feel free to compose within color palettes to evoke emotions.\nConcerning storytelling:It is in it's early stages so I can't tell to much, Would be nice if there was more context within the comic, it is supposed to be a post apocaliptic world as far as I Know but the design and the  geographical depiction doesn't tell me that, also the main characters seems almost like copy one from eachother (talking about personality), if this is what you're aiming for then you've nailed it, but if you haven't pay attention to it then be careful, try to give them a personality trait and stick to it, let them show that. The villains that appeared afterwards have some spark and is very welcome that their personalities are different.\nFinally, You haven't done this, but it is giving me those vibes, avoid exposition! try to keep it at the bare minimum, remember, Show don't tell, for writters this is more abstract and harder to achieve, but us as comic artist can actually show things instead of telling, Keep dialogue and captions for things you can't actually show or to give a costumbrism feel.\nNotes:\nYou have certain basics well stablished here and there, the best advice I could give you is to use photo reference and to study some artistic anatomy, never be afraid to make a mistake and don't ever get attached to a drawing. You are still learning and always can make it better, but in the process gotta crack some eggs to make the omelette."", ""Wow! That's really detailed feedback, thanks a lot!I understood already that there is lack of dynamics in my battle scenes and face expressions. I'm trying to work at this. Also, yes, I tried unusual angles, but I couldn't make them seems good. Instead, they appeared funny. This is one of these attempts, just for example (LOL):About the story: I'm trying to avoid too much text, but I affraid that it makes the plot less clear...

As I told you is just a thing of showing instead telling, keep the amount of text as it is, cause it\'s good just think through ways to depict a more descriptive context within the graphical elements in the panel.\nThe last point. I though the main characters were the red head and the guy with silver hair, and is a thing on their mannerism, expresions and way to talk, is almost like if you were to invert the places you could see them behaving exactly as they already have.']",9/9/2018 0:33,https://forums.tapas.io/t/critique-time-undercopper/26997,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ms-marvel-vol-1-review.jpg389x598 123 KB
(cover pic ""borrowed"" from google) 
To be honest I'm glad i never bought this, even second hand i think it would be money wasted.
The character I loved and could see it gave a good idea of difficulties of teenage life. the artwork is cool but confusing in places.
Sadly the story was one of the worst I have ever read. 
my problem with it is there is no clear understanding of how she gets her powers after getting caught in weird fog, with no explanation of where the fog came from? and on the whole the story seems to make more of an issue to the fact she is from another culture that has be made into a super hero. 
have you read this? and what did you think?","[""I was not a big fan of the book. But the fog is actually the Terrigen Mist that causes Inhumans to gain their powers. There was a Terrigen bomb set off by Black Bolt (if I remember right) that he used to try and activate all inhuman's abilities with."", 'thanks for filling me in on that at least, however if that is the case a whole party of kids were hit by the same mist. no explanation that was the case it was just mist that showed up at a party.', 'No problem, and yeah if you were not reading other inhuman stuff during the time you would be lost. it was ad planning for sure.', ""I actually liked it a lot, as well as Kamala's other comics. The thing there is that some people have the inhuman gene, which causes them to gain abilities when in contact with the mist and get enveloped in a cocoon. The mist was created when the inhumans' king blew up the city and the cristals that make the mist due to some reason involving Thanos."", 'yep thanks,  once i was told about the Terrigen gas i got the whole thing about the cocoon. I just wished they had put it in the ruddy story! this is the problem of main stream comics mixing stories across comics to sell stuff, it just gets too confusing.', ""Yeah, it's a mess, but I think they talked about it in the second volume."", ""To each his own, of course, but to read this as ''one of the worst stories'' is surprising hahaI like Ms. Marvel. I have only read the first two story arcs (translation here in Brazil for it is not the best...) and while I like the character (even if she become kind of a new generation Wolverine, she's everywhere!!), I do think the story ranges from good to ''average'', for lack of a better word. What elevates it to me is how likeable I found the characters. I dig G. Willow Wilson's writing (Air is awesome) and I think she wrote great people into it. Also, new perspectives, that's always awesome. The muslim superhero experience angle is great.\nSpeaking of teenage Marvel books, I do prefer other ones: Ultimate Spider-Man by Bendis, Runaways by K. Vaughan and the absolute goodness that is Young Avengers (both volumes, but holy moly is Gillen/McKelvie run one for the ages!!). But in my book, Kamala is cool. Great and iconic addition to the Marvel canon for me as a character, even though I have to catch up with her book someday.\n(Btw, the story of the Terrigen Mists... I have to recommend Avengers and New Avengers by Jonathan Hickman. Quality stuff. This whole inhuman shenanigans happen in Infinity, one of these series story arcs and it's great)\n\n\nmariusthered:\nand on the whole the story seems to make more of an issue to the fact she is from another culture that has be made into a super hero.\nI mean, it's the Marvel Universe. At this point, there are dozens and dozens of superheroes running around. But a muslim girl gains super powers in a country that can potentially see her as a danger for her race? I feel like that is the story, however well we may feel it's told."", ""I agree Kamala is a likable character. but for me comics are about escape and the whole Political correct stuff and using Characters to make one group or another more except able in the outside world, it's a bit sneaky if you ask me. I personally think religion is a subject to be left out of comics, and I mean any religion not just because this happen's to be about Muslims. (my own family history knows about persecution due to such matters) I guess to be fair I should try to read one of the following books to this and decide fully what i think."", '\n\nmariusthered:\nmy problem with it is there is no clear understanding of how she gets her powers after getting caught in weird fog, with no explanation of where the fog came from?\nyou see, in marvel, to understand anything you need to read everything. thats how they get u\nthe inhuman fog is an established part of the marvel universe - it was released in some fuckup, and turns some people into inhumans bc aliens fucked w their ancestors DNA. theyre like, mutants remixed\n\n\nmariusthered:\nseems to make more of an issue to the fact she is from another culture that has be made into a super hero.\nnothing wrong with that in essence. ms marvel is the first comic of the Big Two to have a muslim title character. the state of islamophobia in america is what it is. g willow wilson has the right to write about the alienation of muslim american identity, and it ties in well with the inhuman allegory.\nms marvel: no normal was formative for me, one of the first marvel comics i bought, and the art expanded my perception of comic arts potential beyond the shiny marvel house style. ms marvel is still one of my favourite marvel comics - its cute and fun, with endearing characters and a great palette. its not perfect by any means, but its important, and good. that said, havent reread it in a few years.', ""\n\nmariusthered:\nbut for me comics are about escape and the whole Political correct stuff and using Characters to make one group or another more except able in the outside world, it's a bit sneaky if you ask me. I personally think religion is a subject to be left out of comics, and I mean any religion not just because this happen's to be about Muslims.\ni feel like peoples complaint about escapism regarding ~PC comics such as ms marvel is that it comes from a narrow, privileged perspective of escapism.\nlets say muslim women are the primary target audience of ms marvel (i say primary bc its appeal is broader than that, but this is arguably who the comic is 'for,' who it matters most to). for a muslim teenage girl in america, seeing a girl like herself lead the superhero life and embrace her faith, overcome the same personal and structural struggles she does, is power fantasy - is escapism.\nlimiting the content of comics by suggesting certain things should stay out of them only limits the medium and its potential. also, a lot of the pioneers of comics have been very openly jewish in their work - religion runs deep in comics. captain america is a golem."", 'maybe so. but I stick to my opinion. I just want to read stories not be told what everybody should want, like and believe.', 'i think thats a misinterpretation of the comic, and heavily tied to your own background and identity. youre welcome to that interpretation and opinion, but its always a good idea to consider how your own self influences how you relate to and interpret a text.', ""I kinda like it. But yeah, the mist and cocoon thing was confusing since I had no idea about the inhumans storyline when I first read it. And the over all story was a bit if a mess.\n I did really like Kamala. Being Mexican-American I could kind of relate the struggle of being of two different cultures.\nBut yeah, if that's not the kind of story you want to read about and want something that only focuses on super hero stuff, I can see why they wouldn't like it."", ""I do like it, but the first storyline kind of one kind of needs to know what's going on with the ongoing Marvel Universe. Like not knowing the Inhumans set off a Terrigen Mist bomb, what the Terrigen Mist are, or what Inhumans are, a lot of people were confused about it.\nAnd considering that she's not getting to involved in major storylines it's understandable why they'd keep her stories small scale (I mean not everything needs to be a world ending cataclysm) and I like how they're not about everyone in her life betraying her and becoming a Super Villain at one point (a lot of Spider-Man stories surprisingly).\nBasically it's something different, and honestly what the industry needs more of, a lot more different. (not to much but a definatly more than we have now)."", ""As I said, to each its own, but I wholeheartedly agree with @punkarsenic. I'm not a fan of this kind of ''escapism'' argument because it's limiting. Comics can be both. They can be escapism and reflection. Comics can be anything.\nI said that in another post, but one of the things I love the most about superheroes is how they tell common stories through hyper heightened symbols. Superman is escapism, but it's also the mythification of the American immigrant story. The X-Men are, as endlessly discussed, a stand-in for a number of minorities. Ms. Marvel is simply the mythification of the muslim experience in America, told through a light and fun superhero filter.\nIt's important to note that those ''allegories'' can never be too complete. There's a limit in which the X-Men can express the LGBTQ+ experience, but nevertheless, in broad strokes, they certainly can manage.\nAnd while I'll be one to argue that the way Marvel has introduced their diverse cast post Secret Wars (Ms. Marvel came before and I actually think it's pretty well done and elegant) was somewhat crass and rushed, I'll also be the first one to argue that who cares as long as we get this overdue diversity after all. The means were sloppy, but the end is so necessary, so important.\nTry the second story arc. If you don't like it, no shame in that, not every comic is for everyone. Plenty of options to chose for everyone and we're all the better for it."", 'I agree we shouldn\'t limit the medium, feeling uncomfortable can sometimes be apart of the appeal (this goes for any one and any view point). I think the problem with some of the stories we see coming out of marvel (and some others) is that they just are low quality and low effort. And its easy to see that is their business plan from having new #1\'s all the time to endless events and even with their new diversity push. It is all half-baked and in some places just lazy, they use ""#1"" , ""event"" , And ""insert minority"" as bait and without passion.', '\n\nEntropicalForest:\nI think the problem with some of the stories we see coming out of marvel (and some others) is that they just are low quality and low effort.

The post Secret Wars Marvel landscape has been a lot of ''throw everything at the wall and see what it sticks''. My main problems with Marvel as a publisher nowadays are:1) Not even that they rely on the ''season'' model, but that they for some obtuse reason WILL DENY IT TO DEATH. They keep saying ''nah we ain't doing that'' for all things we know they are indeed doing. That and holy crap, does the tpb collections get weird and cryptic.2) They were oversaturating the market with books no one asked for. Granted, there are great stuff lost like Mockingbird by Chelsea Cain and Nighthawk by David Walker, but a comic buddy duo with Starbrand and Nightmask? A Slapstick comic? Who the heck is Solo?? They release so many comics even these gems get lost in the fold. It's a terrible ecosystem for a new series to thrive.3) Comics make no money. Not when compared to the MCU. So why should they really care, I sometimes feel?\nThat said, I feel like they were finally able to revamp their writer staff. After Secret Wars they lost 6 of their big writers and it was surely felt. Now with people like Matthew Rosemberg, Donny Cates and Kelly Thompson stepping up, we have some nice talent.I've also been enjoying DC output since Rebirth. They are also kind of overdoing with the new releases, creating a hundred banners, but at least most of those banners are awesome as all hell. I mean, is anyone here reading The Wild Storm?

Now that the 10 chapters are up I was wondering if it would be already to ask for reviews on everything that I have done so far. It's my first time showing my stories and writing to others so I'm really nervous but the reviews and feedback will benefit me a lot. 
I'm looking for any type of feedback when it comes to the story. Anything from character development to the smaller details of grammar. Is the pace of the story too fast? Too slow? is there enough details or there needs to be more? Are the characters well-defined or are they lacking? Is there a lot of grammar errors? (I will admit that one of my weak spots as a writer right now is grammar. No matter how much I re-read and such I always miss something or a handful of errors). Is the structure format good or lacking? Also anything else you can think of that sounds good or may need an improvement. 
Also if you have a story you want to be reviews you can share it here and I will do my best to post a review. 
I hope that is okay to ask for reviews like this. Here is the story:

The Pirate's Chronicle | Tapas
A pirate's life is determined by his code and actions, however their history is recorded in the legendary Pirate's Chronicle. 

Captain Ryo Astrals, a pirate, has claimed the title of Pirate King, there is only one problem. He doesn't remember...





I would like to thank everyone in advance for any reviews that they post.","['Hi! Would you like your review here on this thread or through PM?', ""I'll leave that up to you. If you want to send me a PM about it that is alright or you can post in the topic."", 'Salutations! Well, I read through some of your work and I\'ve got some feedback for you! \nTo start off with, there were two things that struck me when I started reading: your prose, and some of your uncertain details. To begin with, as a reader, I\'m not as invested in the prose because all of the details feel like drive-by details. This happens when you\'ve fallen into Passive Voice. Passive Voice has a number of causes (adverbs AKA: -ly words, being the most prevalent) and one of the causes, in your case is the use of -s instead of -ed. This is a notoriously tricky kind of prose and it\'s very easy to fall into Passive Voice when using it. Now, that doesn\'t mean it\'s impossible to use, however it is difficult to keep your voice Active. \nUsually this kind of writing is used in stage directions and scripts. To expound a little: Passive Voice is what happens when you tell instead of show. As it happens, your story has an exciting premise, but I don\'t FEEL the excitement through the narrative. Instead I feel like I\'m standing next to someone telling me they heard a story, rather than being in the story myself. I\'ll make an example using your text so you can see the difference in action when using -ed versus -s:\nOriginal: On the Pyrus Dragon\'s deck the crew have already prepared for the countermeasures as a tall man stands near the ships wheel. He wears a pirate hat and an overcoat with brown hair down to his shoulders. A crew member rushes to the upper deck and looks up at him.\nEdited: On the Pyrus Dragon\'s deck the crew prepared their own countermeasures. A tall man outlined by his tricorn hat and large weathered privateer coat, stood unfazed by Captain Julius\'s confidence and the roiling gray storm surging from the south, his hand on the ships wheel as though drifting through placid waters. A gunner rushed to the upper deck, soggy footfalls announcing him through the salt seasoned wind and patter of rain.\nNow, my example is just that, an example. It\'s not perfectly edited or anything like that. However, I wanted to show you the difference between how a scene comes across in Active Voice, details just being there, and details helping your audience FEEL like they\'re there. To start with: you mention the weather very sparsely and I don\'t feel like I\'m in it, so much as I\'ve been given a weather report. So adding touches about a \'roiling storm\' or even a \'gray\' storm, can help immensely. You don\'t have to over-describe things to get that across either, just mentioning if there\'s cold, or a storm or, salt spray in the air, can have a dramatic affect on how your readers experience your story. Don\'t forget to use all the senses (Sight, smell, sound, temperature, etc.) to engage your audience. I want to FEEL like I\'m on a boat with your crew, not feeling like I\'m hearing a story second hand in the vein of ""I had to be there.""\nNow, speaking of details, you\'ll notice I had bolded the phase ""a pirate hat"". I\'ve noticed that your details are vague when it comes to the working of your ship. If you\'re going to be writing an entire novel that takes place on a ship, even for laymen, it helps to know your rigging, moorings, crew positions, and clothing. You don\'t have to get so detailed that you bore your audience with unnecessary facts, however, you need enough detail to make it believable as a setting. To start, ""a pirate hat"" doesn\'t tell us anything. Pirates didn\'t all wear the same hat, some had bandannas, skull caps, helmets of a sort, tricorn hats, Monmouth caps, etc. There isn\'t a single hat referred to as ""a pirate hat"" outside of gimmick shops and web stores. Every item of clothing has a proper name, as does every member of a ships crew. \nWhich brings me to the next part that I put in bold: ""a crew member"". Which crew member do you mean, here? Is it the first mate, the gunner, or the bosun? Using vague terms such as ""a crew member"" or ""a pirate hat"" tells me you haven\'t done enough research on your topic, and that is a turnoff as a reader. Now, this doesn\'t mean you haven\'t done research, however, as a reader taking this at face value, I wouldn\'t be able to tell that you had, based on the way the prose is presented. My advice is to research pirate crews, hats and clothing to start with. History, famous pirates, and pirate flag history. There are lots of nuances that, when ignored, can turn off a reader. Most readers aren\'t going to be the super history buff, however, people tend to read about what they\'re most interested in. With regards to things like pirates who had a very real and tumultuous history, impressive/horrifying historical figures, and a culture all their own cobbled together from all their respective experiences, there\'s a lot of flavor in the real history and readers will notice if the spice is missing.\nYour own story doesn\'t have to reflect the history of the real world, if you\'ve invented your own world or alternate history, that\'s totally cool! But the elements of reality sprinkled in will make your world and your characters feel substantial to your readers. To this end, another trouble I see within your prose also has to do with the action sequences. Again, I was still on the first page when the fight scene between Ryo and Captain Julius caused me to stop. Since you\'re sparse on the details of what\'s happening, and what you choose to describe are things passive of the action, rather than inside the action, again I don\'t feel like I\'m in the story, and the image in my head isn\'t very clear based on your prose. Now, action is tricky stuff, you have to keep a pace that\'ll also keep your audience engaged, while giving enough detail to let us know what\'s happening, while not over embellishing and slowing down the scene.\nFear not, I\'ll make an example so you can see what I mean!\nOriginal: The ship rocks as the cannon discharges and a large chunk of metal heads towards Ryo\'s ship. On the Pyrus Dragon Ryo catches a glimpse of the attack and his eyes widen.\n""Men! Brace for impact."" Ryo grips the rails in front of him and everyone else crouches down. Seconds later the cannon ball makes contact with the stern and obliterates the very back of the ship. The huge ship rocks and almost capsizes under the impact. With his feet under him Ryo speaks to a man near the main mast.\nEdited: The Night\'s Tempest rocked as her cannon discharged with a thunderous blare, the aft-most end of Ryo\'s ship obliterated into splinters and metal shrapnel. The Pyrus Dragon careened to the side as the holes in its hull drank up the ocean. \nNow, I know that I cut out a huge chunk of your narrative here, and I\'ll explain. First, I don\'t know if you\'ve ever seen a cannon fired or what your experience is, but only in movies do you have enough time to shout to your crew and have everyone take cover before you\'re struck with a missile. Reality is, Ryo wouldn\'t have had the time to warn his crew about a new cannon that he\'d been unaware of (as in the previous scene Julius was just unveiling this larger cannon). Now, if he\'d seen a larger port-side window open up to unveil a new cannon through his looking glass, he could start adjusting his strategy. However, since none of that was established, he\'d have been blindsided and unable to react in time. \nNow, that\'s just the bit about Ryo being shot. There are other troubles in this scene as well. Captain Julius should not JUST be taking the tarp off of a new cannon. If you know you\'re going to war, you have all your men and artillery at the ready. You don\'t have men too scared to fire a cannon that they\'ve been told they have as an edge over anyone else. Whenever there is new weaponry introduced into a battle situation, people make quick use of it to secure victory. They don\'t ogle and shrink away from the awesome piece of equipment that\'ll assure they stay alive on the open ocean. So that scene didn\'t make a lot of sense from a narrative perspective. To that end, the entire scene of the fight didn\'t make a lot of sense.\nWe open on a man who is the Pirate King, presumably because he\'s earned this position through his cunning and his strategy. He\'s waiting around for the other ship to get into position to shoot at him, rather than hailing cannons and gunfire on approach. This isn\'t very smart, so it undermines the character, because he\'s built up to be smarter than this from the get-go. Now, there\'s an easy fix for this issue: Start your story in the action. Don\'t start before the battle in a ship-to-ship stand-off, start your story with everybody already in the midst of shooting at each other. That way, it doesn\'t look like Ryo waited around to be shot at for no reason, Julius doesn\'t leave a tarp on the best weapon he has at his disposal for no reason, and it also could showcase how dangerous Julius is (by virtue that he\'s brought better artillery to the party) thus, also giving us some very real stakes to go by from the very beginning.\nIf you want your character to be viewed as cunning or smart, you have to show him doing the smart thing in battle. If I had a ship I would not wait for somebody to bring theirs around to broadside cannons before I started firing on them. Granted, cannons of different sorts have different ranges, but I\'d be looking for solutions and consulting with my first mate and my gunners, possibly even my quartermaster about how we were going to tackle a problem. I wouldn\'t wait for the ship to catch up to me and then stink eye them from the bow. I\'d be shooting! (Though, if I\'m a guy who was low on ammo, I\'d have to come up with another strategy entirely Lol, but that\'s another story) So, my recommendation for the beginning of your story would be to plunk us right into the action. That way, Ryo is already imperiled, Julius can show his might, and we\'re not left wondering why Ryo didn\'t do the smart thing and bail. (Sometimes being a good captain also means knowing when to retreat) We wouldn\'t know what happened, only that he\'s in a firefight that he\'s losing, and any number of things could\'ve caused it. \nSo that\'s the battle scene. One thing that struck me about your work is that the pacing is off in some places. When the ship is being blown to pieces and Ryo calls on John to check the damage, the ship is already sinking, yet you have these two people having a conversation, rather than jumping ship. This also doesn\'t make sense, because in the time it takes to have this conversation the ship is already sinking and people are already dying. Ryo shouldn\'t even have this conversation, since he\'s a captain who can probably know when he\'s beaten, he should just be calling out that they abandon ship. John questioning this in the midst of the ship sinking also makes no sense. Why would he question this? They have no way to make a stand, and if he\'s the first mate, (which, I assumed because he\'s the only crewman who gets a name so far) then he should understand his captain\'s orders without explanation.\nI know that this bit was used as exposition of Ryo\'s pirate code, but this is not the time or place for that. This is also not the time or place for Ryo to run to his cabin, as his ship is going down fast and he\'s still being shot at. He should be wearing his pendant because, again, pacing. If he\'s wearing it he doesn\'t have to rush to go get it, thereby using the moment to show his desperate escape. He\'s doing a lot of running around for a guy whose ship is sinking into the ocean in the middle of a storm (which would pick up the waves and cause the ship to take on water faster) AND being shot at. You have to consider all the factors you present when you\'re creating a scene like this. You introduced bad weather, an enemy, and a devastating power gap. You also have to consider real time. When Julius fired again, John wouldn\'t have had time to get people to lifeboats, come back, and get a few more words in edgewise to Ryo in the time it takes to reload and shoot a cannon. This slows the entire scene down and you run into the Christopher Paolini problem of bringing the scene to a halt, to have a conversation (or in his case, over-describe what everyone is wearing).\nSo, here\'s a resource on writing action/fighting1 scenes. This will help show you what I mean. Here\'s one for pacing so you have an idea as to why it\'s important. I also want to give you one for strong scenes so you can get an idea of how a scene can be shined up. I\'ve got another handy tool: Editminion. This will help you a little with your prose, watching out for tricky adverbs that sneak in and detract from your action. To that end, have some prose tips and description tips that can really help with bolstering your roster of skills. I know it\'s a lot of reading, but it IS stuff you\'re going to need to know when you come back and edit your first draft. \nPhew, okay. Now I know I only went on about what happened in the first post. That\'s because, as I read, the problems in the first post were the same ones that persisted later (and my feedback is already long as it is!) so anything that shines up the first post, will do the same with the rest. I will say that you\'ve got an intriguing idea for a story here and I can tell you want it to be something adventuresome and exciting and I think that, you\'ve definitely got that in you. You\'re already doing the right thing, you\'re getting your story down and you\'re getting it out there. EVERYBODY has to make edits like these when they first start a manuscript (and even after previous edits!) so don\'t worry, what I\'ve told you about here is the same stuff all of us have to watch out for, and now that you know about it, that\'ll be easier to do! I think that you have some serious story potential and writing potential as well, and I hope that the resources I\'ve shared help you as you go through your editing phase.\nHuzzah, you made it to the end! (Patience level = 100!) I wish you the best of luck. ', ""You're like the God of reviews on this forum. You must've singlehandedly saved dozens of mediocre stories!"", 'Hahahaha! Well, I think everybody has a great novel in them, it\'s just the matter of knowing the details. \nThat, and I\'m an editor so when I see the word ""feedback"" the little dust bunnies in my brain get all enthusiastic and start pulling out the myriads of playbooks. XD', ""Thank you so much for the review. It will take time to go over everything that you mentioned and explained to me so that i can relook at the chapters I already published. I hope that you didn't mind posting such a long review. I'm really grateful for it. I really value all feedback that I get for my writing, it helps me so much to improve as a writer."", ""Hey no problem! Yeah there's definitely a lot there so, I'd say you can take your time with it. XD It doesn't all have to be done by tonight or something, hahahah!\nNah, I don't mind. It was fun, and I really do believe you've crafted an interesting story here. I'm stoked that the feedback I gave will help you out and I know you'll improve. You've got this, all the way.

Vicar ST :: Pg 4 | Tapas
It's been a long time since my last update. Let's get back into it. spent a bit more time on my pencils  this time instead of detailing in the inks phase.





","[""Don't take my opinion too serious as I'm trying to see what could be possibly the problem of your comic\nI think your art is too busy(?), I can't see right away what's going on each panel, the style is cool, but as a comic book if you add too much shadows on it, important informations can be lost\nThe speech bubbles needs to be break into two parts or more, so one panel doesn't hold too much text (if you put too much information, it can make readers lazy to read)"", 'Welcome back! I hope my advice can help at least a little bit. First, your inks are well done, and I love your art style. Those ragged, blocky edges and detailed yet stylized character designs give your work a lot of personality.Problem is, sometimes the art is a little too stylized -- there are a lot of character close-ups that look more like abstract art than, well, characters. Details are great and stylization is great, but most of the time your goal should be, ""is this panel easy to understand?"", and not just ""does this panel look cool""? It would help if you pulled back the camera sometimes, especially at the beginning of a scene. It\'s best to have at least one panel showing the characters from a distance, so the reader knows what they look like as a whole, what they are doing, and where they are. I found myself getting lost a few times.Other issues are minor nitpicks. I generally like your colour choices, but you can really take your colouring to the next level with more careful rendering. Research the ""cut and grad"" method -- it\'s what colourists at Marvel and DC use. K Michael Russel has tutorials on YouTube if you want to check them out. There are several typos (""wen"", ""peice"") and some missing punctuation, as well as some speech bubbles that are too long for the panels they\'re in. Can\'t say much about the story or characters, as we\'re only a few pages in, but you\'ve got a really interesting concept, and I for one am really intrigued about how the story will go. I\'m sure it will grow into something spectacular!', ""This is very helpful. I keep struggling with the shadows because people tell me they like it but I really wanted to emphasis the clarity, which I once again failed at unfortunately. I'll try to scale back some of the blacks. Super thanks"", 'I thought about this for a while. I have a question.Do you think I have too many render lines facing the light source (killing the anatomy)  or am I just casting too much of the body in black. ... or both equally problematic?', ""I don't think the main issue is how much black or how many render lines you have, but how they're used. Every line needs to tell us something; it might describe the line of a muscle, or show the texture of fur. Problem is, your characters have lines all over the place that don't seem to have a reason to be there. They don't accurately describe a character's anatomy or emotion, and both fur and clothing have the texture of crumpled paper. Basically, you seem more concerned with the details than with the structure underneath, and the structure needs to come first.Here's a tip: look at the page from a bit of a distance. Can you tell which character is which, and what they're doing? It might help to look at the page as a whole. Hope that helps ""]",7/30/2018 20:10,https://forums.tapas.io/t/critique-after-hiatus/26092,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm currently working on chapter 2 of my comic, but I'm thinking of going back to chapter one and sprucing it up a bit so I'd like some feedback on things that could be improved in the chapter. Looking for things that are more specific (since I already know the first chapter is slow augh). Any panels or areas that look particularly off or bad? Any part of the story that seems like it's too jarring and could transition better? Anything not explained well? etc.

Pretty well any comic outside of the romance genre is going to struggle to get readers which is so unfortunate.  \nYou could edit for vertical scroll because most people read on their phones and it's easier to mindlessly read than pages.  Some will disagree with that but I personally think it's better for mobile users.\nMy biggest recommendation is to have and promote the romance storyline even if it's not the main genre.  Have the couple on the thumbnail as well.  Romance is the biggest genre and it's what attracts the most readers.  \nThe actual comic is awesome you just need to find a way to get more people to click your thumbnail each time you update.  Play around with different thumbnails.  As I said above the main romantic couple would be a good one to try.  Gluck!"", ""Thank you for the advice! Putting a couple into the thumbnail does sound like a good idea, possibly one to promote in chapter 3 since we get a bit of romance in that chapter.  For the vertical scroll, I wouldn't rule it out completely since I like to leave my options open. I'm not a huge fan personally and it would take quite some time to set up, but it is something I am considering a bit nowadays since it is popular and I do want to get my work out there a bit more."", ""Cavechan,\nLooked over your first Chapter. I feel the artwork is looking good. When doing comics I always try to keep in mind each panel is one frame of artwork, so what is the best way to illustrate what needs to be communicated in that panel. Keep experimenting with different ways to communicate effectively and clearly with each panel, then also how the overall page flows as well (ex. is it easy to follow and makes the reader want to continue on to the next page. Also, I'm sure you are already doing it, but seeing how many kinds of comics set up their panels is good research too.\nAs for the story, personally, I would avoid going back to change things. Imagine that once something is published/ posted it's finished. You can't touch it anymore. Anything you might need to change, try to handle/ adapt for it in future chapters.\nThat said, I personally wouldn't work on any story that doesn't have a finished script. Writing things as you go can get difficult to manage the longer you draw out the story.\nHope that helps. Best of luck with the story!"", ""Thank you for the feedback!

The ending I had isn't even really the ending anymore... I don't even really have an ending right now (don't get me wrong, I know what happens, I just don't know where/how the end is exactly). So now the thumbnails at least are still far from done, though getting there!

From personal experience, I'd say practicing gesture drawing from figures in motion would really help breathe more life into your action scenes.\nI have to admit I agree with @laiscnogueira about the close-ups.

"", ""Let me start off by saying your artwork for your comic is incredible <3 Ever since i've started drawing i've battled with stiffness and I think you are totally right about gesture drawing. Years ago i used a program called posemaniacs for gesture drawing which i think was a pretty big mistake. All their models were 3d and stiff themselves but they had good proportions. Since then I haven't done any gesture drawing. I'll start at it again but do it right this time around. I'm entering the webtoon contest with my comic super galaxy squad and trying to create a 35 panel episode every other week which is why I do a lot of close ups. But you both are right, I'm really just lessening the impact of panels and hurting my comic in the long run. I'll try harder to stray away from close ups.Thanks for the complements too, coloring is pretty foreign to me, but I've taken inspiration from a webtoon called Ghost Teller and I think its really helped with my color palette and atmosphere. Though I'm still terrible at it lol Backgrounds are also something I really want to do as much as possible of but man they are hard and time consuming haha!Thanks again for all of the advice! I'll try my best to learn from it and apply it <3"", ""I'll review it later, I'm also making a comic for the contest, but I'm too slow haha "", ""Oh man that contest sounds intense. I can totally see how it would be tempting to cut corners under the circumstances.\nI actually once used posemaniacs quite a lot too, since I'm self-taught, and used to be quite isolated as an artist. Honestly- I have the same gripes about it. It's just not the same as drawing from life. One thing that did help me a lot (and I'm definitely still learning) is just going out to a busy street and doing very quick gesture drawings of passersby. It's free too, unlike life-drawing classes- and usually more accessible x) \nAlso- thank you for the kinds words.

","[""I like the setting. You see I have a thing for fantasy and magic. Total Narnia and Potter fan (Eragon and others are good too).\nBut I think you would benefit from a beta-reader or a friend willing to read your work.\nYou put too much information on the same paragraph. It's okay to separate small lines of dialogue over the paragraphs, it's better than adding different characters phrases on the same line. 'Cuz it can gets a little confusing IMO.\nThe timing of the actions too could be more separate. From my understanding the prologue transpired during a few day (I'm not a native english speaker and had no idea what fortnight was, had to google it lol), but the information is thrown all at once and you don't exactly get the idea that time is flowing. Maybe it would be good to literaly space it, like:- A fortnight passed and 1, 2 and 3 happened.- Then another five days of 4 and 5.\nAs for grammar I didn't spot anything wrong.But I would advise to work with shorter rather than long sentences, 'cuz you can lost your reader.\nI think you have a lot of potential, but honestly I couldn't really follow the story that well because of what I mentioned above. I had to read a few phrases more than once to get it.If you fix it, you'll probably get more people reading you work and will improve it's quality. Or at least I believe so."", 'Salutations! Okay I\'ve read through your work and I\'ve some feedback for you!  I\'ll start with technicals and story implementation!\nVery first on this list is actually the first sentence that threw me. In the first paragraph where Branden is searching corpses, you state that he\'s ""-of nineteen years of age"". You don\'t need two usages of...well, ""of"". You can say ""Branden was a young knight of nineteen years"" because it\'s the same thing, and you don\'t have an extra ""of"" to derail a reader. Now, one of the other things is that, you start us off in a sequence where two people are searching bodies, but then we suddenly get an exposition dump about how Branden became associated with Karn and has no noble house. This is not a good transition. I was chucked out of the scene to be given backstory we don\'t yet need.\nI\'ll give an example of setting so you know what I mean. We start with these guys searching corpses looking for a mage. This would be the right time to bring up the rarity of mages and what they\'re for (because you do this after you exposit about Branden\'s backstory) so that we, the reader, have context as to what Karn is looking for. It\'s more important in this moment than Branden\'s backstory, because we\'re literally in the middle of a scene, which you then pause to tell us information that has nothing to do with this direct moment, so we lose our story momentum. Now, if we were back at camp and Branden was thinking about his father and why he\'d come to serve Karn at the kings order, that would work because people become pensive when staring into a campfire. However, randomly while on a mission makes the exposition feel forced and out of place, when the context of the mage in this case is more important.\nNow, I noticed a lot of your issues in a single paragraph all cropping up at once. So, what I\'ll do is paste your paragraph below and paste an edited version, and explain the edits. Here we go!\nOriginal: ""I am going to go check on Lord Hywin."" Sir Jason stood up smiled and walked into the tent, Sir Karn joined Branden handing him a horn of wine. ""Aye boy, you alright?"" Karn asked as he took a deep sip of wine, Branden nodded and drank his wine. ""Where is Lord Hywin?"" a voice yelled, ""Lord Hywin"" it yelled again. A man dressed in leather armor with a fur cloak carrying a satchel, darted towards the fire. He was mid thirties with a scruffy beard. ""Where is Lord Hywin?"", ""In the tent"" a knight pointed out. ""Thank-you kind sir"" he said then he walked into the tent, a few minutes later out came the three men. Lord Hywin walked towards the fire ""you can all leave, return to your own holdings."" he commanded. No one asked why and they all headed in separate directions, ""King\'s orders,"" Karn said before he vanished from sight.\nEdited: ""I am going to go check on Lord Hywin."" Sir Jason stood up smiled and walked into the tent, Sir Karn joined Branden handing him a horn of wine. ""Aye boy, you alright?"" Karn asked as he took a deep sip of his own, Branden nodded and drowned the images in his head with his drink. The camp was quiet, the normal chatter now a mumble as the air stank of death. Two miles north of the carnage wasn\'t far enough to make camp so far as Branden was concerned. Not even alcohol could purge the memory of spilled blood from his nostrils. ""Where is Lord Hywin?"" yelled a man dressed in leather armor with a fur cloak. He carried a satchel and an intent mien as he darted towards the fire. ""In the tent"" a knight pointed out. ""Thank-you kind sir"" he said as he ambled through the canvass flaps without introduction. Sir Karn alert at the sign of this messenger, got up from his seat at Branden\'s side and followed after him into the tent. Moments later Lord Hywin emerged with the messenger and Sir Karn at his side as they approached the circle of knights by the fire. ""You can all leave, return to your own holdings."" he commanded. ""King\'s orders,"" Karn said before he vanished from sight. The gathering remained mute, uneasy glances traded from one knight to the next.\nPhew, okay, so you\'ll notice I\'ve done a few things here. To start: I put everything in bold that you repeated throughout the paragraph. Using the exact same descriptors (such as ""walked"") for every motion puts everything in your narrative on repeat and it can actually make someone put your novel down. I made it to this paragraph before I had to stop and start writing my feedback, because you have many instances of repetition that distract the eye, but they all culminated pretty heavily in this paragraph. Using different words to describe action can tell the reader a lot. What if the messenger was running? Was he urgent? Was he out of breath? Were his cheeks red in the dim light? All of these little things can tell us if the message was important. Which, seeing as how when the messenger showed up everyone effectively lost their job, that\'d be pretty important. So telling us that he ""walked"" everywhere doesn\'t really let us know if the message is urgent, so we, the audience, don\'t know how to feel. It\'s just a thing that\'s being told to us.\nLikewise, I feel no urgency or impending dread here, which I should feel if everyone loses their job suddenly without warning. That\'s a huge red flag that something has gone wrong, yet I didn\'t feel that way. I just felt like everybody in camp wasn\'t even there or listening to begin with. Part of the trouble here is atmosphere. To establish atmosphere you have to let the audience know more than the base facts such as, there\'s a messenger, there\'s a message, and you\'re all jobless. Are the knights singing around the camp fire, being drunk, being solemn, is everyone quiet for no particular reason, is there a sense of dread, unease, what does the wind smell like, fire or death? There are SO many things missing here that can make your audience FEEL the moment.\nWhen I edited the paragraph, I interpreted the scene as solemnity because, really, I had no indications for or against it, I just ran with it because you didn\'t tell me what was going on. You did say Sir Jason and a few men around the camp fire talked about their families and triumphs, but I still had no idea what the general feeling of the scene actually was. They\'ve been finding innocent people dead for days, with no sign of letting up, yet I still felt nothing. I was just told that Sir Jason told a story and some men talked shop. In fact, this scene is a better moment to introduce Brendan\'s backstory because he can become pensive thinking about his own family when others are bringing up theirs. \nThis is where we get into ""Show don\'t Tell"" as well. You told me a lot of things, but you didn\'t paint the scene. You told me that we were in camp, that a messenger came, and Brendan doesn\'t have a job now. You also told me that the knights all dispersed without a word. Now, I don\'t live in a caste system, but when a company I used to work for had massive layoffs, people were pretty vocal about it and these people were all loyal. Karn didn\'t have to quell unease or questioning, there were no rumblings of discontent after the announcement, just nothing. No feeling at all, so suddenly the scene itself isn\'t important. It just felt ""meh, okay"" and that was it. So far, you\'ve got scenes, but they just feel like a list rather than a narrative. ""Thing A happened, so now thing B can happen, followed by thing C."" It\'s not very engaging.\nI\'ve also noticed that you spend a lot of time describing people\'s beards as ""scruffy."" There\'s only so many times that can be used before it becomes too well worn. A Thesaurus is a good tool to help you find other descriptors if you find yourself at a loss. Don\'t go Thesaurus crazy, though. Some descriptors work and some don\'t depending on their definition so, whenever you look up a new word, take it over to the Dictionary to determine whether or not it makes sense in your context. \nAnother trouble we run into is that you overuse people\'s names after they\'ve been introduced. Notice how, in your paragraph I bolded Lord Hywin\'s name? You said it the exact same way five times in a single paragraph. I was able to get the same point across in my edited paragraph without having to state his name over and over. Again, this comes down to narrative flow and what distracts readers, and overuse of a character\'s name is one of those things. I\'ll make an example so you can see right off:\nI live with my roommate Jim, Jim is good at X. I\'m trying to work on projects with Jim and while I\'m very busy Jim likes to laze about. Jim isn\'t very good at staying on task, but I like Jim. Jim\'s got a good sense of humor.\nSee how distracting that is? It\'s the same principal. You can indicate who is talking or who is important in the scene without so much repetition. Likewise in Tullec, in your very first paragraph you use ""edge"" as a descriptor three times in four sentences. So, I\'d recommend making sure you\'re not repeating yourself or your descriptors too much in single paragraphs. It\'s an easy habit to slip into so, getting out can be tough but it is totally doable. Speaking of paragraphs. See how in my edited version of your paragraph, I started a new line with every new speaker? This is done to prevent audience confusion. I actually didn\'t know clearly who had been saying what before, because it was all within the body of a single paragraph. Hitting enter and starting your dialogue on its own line is the best way to keep it all straight for a reader, and it makes your narrative flow more easily.\nNow, I\'m not going to leave you high and dry without editing goodies! First off Editminion1. This handy tool gives you a heads up on adverbs (-ly words which should be used sparingly if ever, because they can take your narrative out of Active Voice and turn it into Passive Voice). It can also help you with seeing if words are being repeated, misspelled, or if you\'re ending on a preposition. It\'s a handy little tool that can make editing WAY faster. Now, on to the next bit, here are some resources to help you construct atmosphere1, paragraphs1, and dialogue with regards to paragraphs1.\nPhew, okay, that was a long bit. Still, I hope these resources help. Honestly you\'ve got a good premise (and I\'m a sucker for mages. You should see all my Dragon Age series quests) and I think that you can make a good go of your story. You\'ve got some editing to do, but that\'s the nature of writing novels. EVERYBODY has some editing to do, not just you, and we ALL run into the repetition problems and atmosphere issues. It\'s just part of the process, so you\'re already doing exactly what you should be. Don\'t feel discouraged at the amount of editing or the what, because we all do it just the same. You\'re going to make something awesome happen here and you\'ll get there in your own time. You got this!  \nAlso, fair is fair. My work also needs a lot of editing right now, but you\'re welcome to check it out and give me feed back as well.  After all, we\'re all conquering this thing together. (Don\'t forget to read my description, if it sounds like something you won\'t like, it\'s totally fine if you don\'t want to read it).\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nThe Locks of Skaa\'rev :: 1-1 | Tapas\nSalutations!

(Well I\'m assuming her personality from your use of facial expressions, she is cheerful and can be shy)-The art style is consistent, nothing really looks out of place, it\'s simplistic and consistently simplistic. Although a nitpicky thing is that the first and last panel of the first post has some of the image bleeding out of the panel (Says me, I always have trouble keeping images within a panel ), but its very minor, so you don\'t have to change it, but you can if you wish.-The story is understandable so far, it introduces the character and it seems as though, she is recording herself on a camera telling how she moved with a character named \'Doctor May\' and it is currently her twelfth day with Doctor May. She states that she doesn\'t remember anything before she started living with Doctor May, which can hint to various possibilities on the main character\'s Ryuka\'s origin. From the second last panel, it seems as though Ryuka isn\'t supposed to use the camera or something? Although I didn\'t understand the last panel\'s dialogue, you can change that if its a mistake don\'t if either that\'s intentional or I\'m just too dumb to understand.\nGreat start so far!

But otherwise amazing comic!"", 'Ah thank you!  yeah his design didn’t turn out the best but I’m too lazy to change it\u200b', 'Salutations. Well, since we\'re only one page in I don\'t have a ton of feedback, however, there are some things that I noticed that I\'ll share.\nIn the third panel from the top her left hand is on backwards. If she\'s going to point at her face, her index finger would be on the outside of her hand, not the inside. Try it yourself, point at your own face with your index finger just as she\'s doing, with your left hand. You\'ll notice that the index finger is on the outside of your hand and that your other fingers will be under your chin, rather than being on the outside of the hand. If you ever need a reference, you can look online or in the mirror at home for some of the simple stuff, like with hands or facial expressions etc.\nAnother thing I noticed is that, you have spelling errors. On your introductory page, when you say Doctor May\'s name, May isn\'t capitalized and it should be, in fact there are a couple of instances where Doctor May\'s name isn\'t capitalized, so I\'d go back and edit that so your audience doesn\'t get confused. You also have a spelling error in this line - ""To preserve my memories incase they get wiped sagain."" Those bolded words should be ""in case"" and ""again"". Another issue with dialogue: In the first page you say Doctor May\'s name four times, almost every other dialogue box. Once you\'ve established a character\'s name, repeating it a lot is actually distracting to a reader.\nI\'ll give an example. Say you\'re talking to a new friend and they start off like this:\nI live with my roommate Jim, Jim is good at X. I\'m trying to work on projects with Jim and while I\'m very busy Jim likes to laze about. Jim isn\'t very good at staying on task, but I like Jim. Jim\'s got a good sense of humor.\nSee how overuse of a name can start to make you as a reader have pause? Once you introduce a character, you don\'t need their name constantly. I\'ll make an example of your dialogue so that you can see what I mean:\nEdited: - ""Hi, my name is Ryuka and I\'m an assistant for Doctor May. Today marks my twelfth day with her, and I\'ve learned so much since I\'ve moved here. Unfortunately I don\'t remember anything before I started living here, and I\'m afraid I might forget the precious memories I\'ve made with her.""\nNow, you do not have to redo your dialogue in this exact way. This is just an example. This falls more along the lines of narrative dialogue flow. If you reiterate a name too many times, it\'ll begin to stand out and hamper your dialogue. This also goes for overuse of any word, so I\'ve got this here that can help you edit dialogue and catch misspelled words, and so on. Now, some of the suggestions Editminion makes is more for novelists than for comic dialogue so, it\'s okay if you don\'t take all of the advice it gives, however, if you don\'t have a way to catch misspelled words, when you write your text in the dialogue box, it red-lines the text that\'s misspelled so, I figured it could help.\nIn regards to the actual art style it\'s nice, your lines are clean, you\'ve got a nice color scheme so far, you\'ll just have to practice proportions and a few fundamentals here and there, but ultimately those come with time and you\'re well on your way anyhow. You\'re going to do just fine if you keep at it and look out for spelling errors.  I hope this feedback helps you and here\'s wishing you luck with your new comic! \nFair is fair, if you\'ve got any feedback for me, I\'d love to hear it. \n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nThe Awlers | Tapas\n- - Updates every Monday- -\n\n~From where do Runners come,\nAnd where do Runners go?\nThe Wolpr must collect them,\nTo mend the world\'s woe.~\n\nThis story follows Mun, a munchkin kitty who seeks magic to make her into a normal sized cat and Goon, a...\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""Dude thank you so much for the feedback!

527,A place where an artist can ask an opinion of their drawing,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So I started this because I actually want to ask you guys to look at these two picture below and choose one that you considered better.
Any other artist can also put their comic panel or drawing if they can't decide 'which one looks better' or other things to see other peoples preview of the said art.
Let me start. This is a screenshot of a comic panel (its in webcomic format). They're in a bar, a reunion is happening, hence the shadow figure. Which background do you thin looks better? A or B? Or should I blanked the background?

Thanks ahead of time for you're time =3.","['I’m not good at giving reviews but I’ll give it a shot.\nGotta say I really love the characters, especially that protagonist, so adorbs. I don’t feel it’s the most original story but I feel it’s well done which is most important\u200bThe art is pretty good as far as the characters. The action scenes with the effects are great! And overall I found it to be a veeery enjoyable read:3 I’m looking forward to more\u200b\nHowever you REALLY need to work on some of those backgrounds. Even if you don’t want to draw a background you need to use less white. I found that even if you just put some gray areas in the background it really helps the scene. Your comic deserves some good backgrounds man:3 I don’t really like how only the eyes have colored:/ it’s really just a distraction and takes from the mood of the story. I think you paneling could be better. There’s a lot of space between them and the lines around them are very thick. Make the lines thinner and vary the spacing between panels. I see that you are doing this mostly traditionally but I would strongly recommend you put this into vertical format. I switched and I feel it really helped my story  There are ways of doing it with traditional lineart, so I would recommend you try it out.\n...And if you maybe want to return the favor and review my webcomic \n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nCrime & Cars | Tapas\nA very interesting story about the schemes and misadventures of a cold trophy-wife, Renée, and a cocky teen scoundrel, Rudy, set in circa 1930s.

529,Am I ripping off someone else’s style?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi! I started drawing a cartoon webcomic some weeks ago. The artistic level of users from this forum is incredible high, so I want to clarify that I am not a professional illustrator. My drawings are crappy (but I really enjoy making them on my free time  )  My main focus with this webcomic is (1) to have fun (2) improve my drawing and storytelling skills (3) practice some english. Nothing serious.
I like how I draw animals and creatures, but I hate my 'humans'. So I am trying to restyle them as an undefined mixture of animal/human. Also, I would like to change the eyes to improve expressivity. But now they look suspiciously familiar to me. I am not sure if I am ripping off someone else's characters, and I cannot remember. 
Can somebody tell me if this looks TOO similar to some other artist style? (Image attached below)
I would be ok with my characters being 'generic' (wich they are), but I don't want to be accused of plagiarism.
Thank you so much!

Come on, writers! Let's chat!","['Salutations!\nOkay, I\'ve read through some of your posts and I\'ve got some feedback for you! \nTo start, writing in the First Person POV is difficult. In Third Person Omniscient you can cover so many details, and in First you\'ve only the perspective of Art, and he has palpable feelings and anxieties I think you represent well. One of the hitches that I\'ve run into is your use of -s versus -ed. Now, I know I hand this bit of advice out a lot but, -s has a tenancy to throw you into Passive Voice and create distance between the reader and the action. Now, that\'s not to say it\'s impossible to use -s versus -ed, but it\'s pitfalls are that it\'s incredibly difficult to keep the action in the now with the reader. You also have adverbs that take the action further away from the reader (-ly words) and so we\'ve hit a bit of a double whammy here. I actually have an example from your text to show you where some of your active moments become passive:\nOriginal: Art\'s quarters are larger than Olive\'s spare room, and very finely furnished. The two windows, barely above the ground outside, are covered with thick curtains, much like the ones in Jean\'s office. His bed is carved from dark red cherry wood with a matching vanity, floating shelves, and desk. The floors are hard, wooden, but like much of the house he has seen so far, is complimented by a Persian rug.\nEdited: Art\'s quarters are larger than Olive\'s spare room, furnished with thick curtains, much like the ones in Jean\'s office; his bed carved from dark red cherry wood accompanied by a matching vanity, floating shelves, and desk. The hard wood floors complimented by a Persian rug.\nSo, words here that put me further from the action: Are, is, and, with, and this sentence: ""but like much of the house he has seen so far."" The reason for this, is that are, is, and with, act as buffer words, or extra words, much like -ly words tend to be. (Notice, you can usually take an -ly word out of a sentence and it\'ll still function just fine, or you could rework a sentence to include an -ed equivalent and it comes out smoother). Now, this isn\'t always the case, so you don\'t have to drive yourself crazy looking for every use of these words, however, just know that sometimes they kick your audience out of the action with Art. \nIn regards to the sentence about the rug: We\'ve spent a lot of time describing the house, (as you\'re establishing the house as a character, so in this case I actually think your descriptions of the house are good, because the house will be a participant in this story as well) so we know that there are Persian rugs abound in the rest of the house as well, so when you mention the rug again, it just feels like an extra sentence establishing an already established tidbit of information, as if you\'re reminding your audience to notice these details. Now, that\'s not to say that you are doing that on purpose (because, we\'ve ALL done this, I do it, and then I realize I\'ve just reiterated a detail and I smack myself. Hah) but I just wanted to give you a heads up that, as a reader, it distracted me because I\'d already absorbed this detail.\nNow, you\'ve got a beautiful repertoire of words that you use to great affect. You can really paint a scene so, by no means think that I can\'t tell what\'s going on because, you\'ve got that totally handled. I will give you a heads up that sometimes, however, the details become list-like instead of narrative like. I\'ll make another example:\nOriginal: He\'s dressed in expensive dress pants, the matching blue jacket hanging from the back of his chair rather than from his shoulders. On top he wears a plain white button-up, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, no tie in sight. Only a small sliver is visible where the bottom of the desk doesn\'t touch the floor, and Art sees a flash of shined shoes as his employer crosses his legs.\nEdited: Attired in expensive dress pants his matching blue jacket hung off the back of his chair. He sat casual in his plain white button-up, sleeves rolled to his elbows, no tie in sight. A small sliver of space visible where the bottom of the desk didn\'t touch the floor, Art swore he caught a flash of shined shoes as his employer crossed his legs.\nIn the first instance, I felt like I was receiving a list, rather than also being involved with Art\'s perception at the same time. (Which, here\'s a guy from the mail room being handed a completely different kind of job standing in front of a man who can afford to be casual and yet still imposing, so involving verbs to explore that can really make your descriptions pop) When I edited this I added words like ""swore"" and ""casual"" while deleting extra words and using other verb tenses so that it doesn\'t feel like a list, but a moment. That\'s not to say the original is horrible or something, this is just an example as how a few tweaks can take a narrative further. Now, I did bold ""Dress"" and ""dressed"" and that\'s because both being used right next to each other took me out of the narrative. This doesn\'t always happen, however in this case one was his \'dress pants\' and the other was how he\'d been \'dressed\' and using the same descriptor back to back can gum up your narrative. Granted, you don\'t have to go thesaurus crazy, it\'s just a matter of maybe using a different word or restructuring a sentence.\nJust be aware that the tense your writing in has a tendency to kick the narrative into \'telling\' rather than \'showing\' if you\'re not careful, and can lead to the \'list\' problem by its nature. (This tense is something that I\'ve used to write scripts where I had to get details off in short hand so the next guy could understand the scene without too much description, but just enough to give him the general idea. So I more often see the use of -s in stage directions or screenplays) All that being said, I don\'t think you have to route your writing style or change it all over to -ed, so much as just be aware that this particular style has these tendencies and that other verb usage can often solve the issues.\nSpeaking of verbs, you\'re hovering around the Purple Prose department. Now, I do know that the immaculate nature of your character is important because it\'s very much part of the identity of your story, so I don\'t think you need to gut your descriptions, however there are a few things I\'d like to point out as being distracting to a reader. Case in point, this was the first one that really got me:\n""and her blouse is the color of angry clouds.""\nAKA: Gray. This description distracted me. I know that you were trying to get across their relationship by calling her attire \'angry\' and \'gray\' however, her demeanor already spoke to her feelings, so to describe her clothes as \'the color of angry clouds\' rather than saying something like \'steel gray\', or \'cold gray\', \'warm gray\', etc. was distracting. Some things don\'t need to have extra description of this kind, because you already did a good job establishing the overall mood and so this kind of description distracted from what was already well done. I will actually share this little article with you2, it\'s sort of a guide on how to spot when you\'ve gone too purple and need to reign it back in. (Being that I\'ve been hella guilty of this in the past, I always try to share these kinds of resources where needed.)\nThat doesn\'t mean you can\'t have descriptions that are beautiful, it\'s just a means of tightening up your narrative and not over describing certain details. Most of your novel at this point consists of describing the clothing and surroundings (which, seeing as how these things will act as characters of their own that in other ways, describe Jean, this isn\'t bad. You\'re really establishing who he is with these bits, so I\'m on board for it) so you just want to make sure that the descriptions don\'t drag, because with your particular kind of novel, these things will inevitably be important and establish soft details we\'ll count on all the way through as our cues. If the readers start getting distracted with the prose, they\'ll miss the key things you\'re layering in.\nPhew jeeze, sorry about the veritable novel! I\'ll be blunt here, I think you\'ve got hella chops. You really do, your command of language and interesting nuances are all there and really, all you need to do is look out for some small factors when you edit. I mean, my own narrative right now is gutted and lacks in the description department (because I know I\'m going to have to go back and add some panache lol), so you\'re starting on the other end from me, you\'ve got serious panache, you just have to play with the verbs a bit. To that end, and to help you out with some of the small things, I will give to you my favorite tool: Editminion1! It\'s a great help for catching small stuff that you might miss as you edit, weak words, unnecessary adverbs, etc. (I love this little guy).\nI hope that my feedback is helpful to you when you go through your editing phases. I think you\'ve really got the stuff it takes to make this novel shine so, kudos! If you made it to the end of this thing, congrats, your patience knows no bounds. Also, fair is fair. My novel is a damned wreck right now, but you\'re welcome to watch my overturned train carcass as it smolders, awaiting some serious edits lol:\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nThe Locks of Skaa\'rev | Tapas\nAn old and angry magic,\nA one with many eyes,\nThey see the world tragic,\nAnd all yet living dies.\n\nBroken hearts make sacrifice,\nThe sundered two shall rise,\nThe fearful shall endure the price,\nTo conquer many eyes.\n\n--\n\nWhen Khloe’s mage...\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers! ', 'Hey!\nThank you so much for your honest feedback. The editminion tool is fabulous - I had no idea such a thing existed! Passive voice is something I always try to keep in mind, but always seem to forget about. Your review and suggestions will be very helpful during my final edits!\nNow, for The Locks of Skaa\'rev:\nFirst of all, what immediately stood out to me is that each character you\'ve presented has their own voice, their own personality, their own soul. That\'s such a fabulous trait for a writer to have; I\'ve struggled with making my characters distinct in the past, so hats off to you! When Khloe moves, talks, or even just looks at something, I can tell it\'s her.\nEvery character you have is their own individual, and that makes them compelling, as an ensemble. Excellent work!\nAs far as critique goes, I have only a few pointers that will really increase ease of reading. One thing I\'ve noticed is how you end dialogue. Here\'s a quick example, from chapter two:\n""Oh I\'m sure by this time next year they\'ll be right as rain."" She chirped.\nThe dialogue will typically read smoother with a ""said"" verb if you end with a comma, then a lowercase pronoun. How I\'d suggest editing this:\n""Oh, I\'m sure by this time next year they\'ll be right as rain,"" she chirped.\nAnother thing I think will really help with easy flow is keeping in mind paragraph spacing. Here\'s an example from chapter three:\n""That happened ten years ago, and I wish the two of you could talk about it instead of sniping back and forth. Granted, I know it isn\'t easily forgiven but, you don\'t have to passively goad each other all the time, do you?"" Anaiah\'s eyes fell.\nThis line of dialogue is given by Anaiah\'s mother. Because Anaiah is mentioned lowering his eyes at the end, it gives the impression that he, in fact, is the one that spoke instead of Lady DuPont. It can become a little confusing at times, but thankfully your characters have such distinct voices that it can be made out despite that!\nI\'d recommend keeping in mind that each paragraph belongs to the character speaking. I\'d put Anaiah\'s eyes falling on its own line, or have it share the paragraph with his next line of dialogue. Especially with scenes involving more than two characters, be sure to separate their actions and dialogue. The audience tends to read paragraphs as a whole, and shorter paragraphs and lines read faster than long ones.\nThat isn\'t to say that the occasional long paragraph doesn\'t have its place in a story; quite the opposite! Reading is as much a visual, pictorial experience as it is about the actual words.\nMy last bit of critique is to consider all the ""said"" verbs and substitutes.\nI think you\'ve done an AWESOME job of not just using the word ""said"" all the time, and you have a great number of substitutes to keep reading interesting and fresh. What I\'d recommend considering is taking a look at each line of dialogue during your final edits. ""Said"" and said substitutes, as well as said adjectives, should be used when the words have a certain way they are meant to be read, when needed for emphasis or to set tone, or to indicate who is speaking. If it\'s obvious who is delivering the line, I recommend omitting the ""said"" verb entirely! It can really tighten up your scenes, make them clean and easy to read, understand, and digest.\nDon\'t feel obligated to read this at all, but here\'s a blog post I wrote about ""said"" and said substitutes. I wrote it to help myself out when I was struggling with improving my writing, and it helped to organize my thoughts. If you\'re interested, here it is: Said Substitutes1\nI think the dynamic you have between each of the characters is dynamite; I can feel the tension between these characters, and you\'ve done an amazing job really bringing them to life and making them seem like real people. I care what happens to them, and that\'s such a valuable skill as an author, I can\'t even commend you enough for that.\nI hope I was helpful! Thanks again so much for your kind words and honest feedback. I hope you have a great day, and happy writing!', ""(Isn't the Editminion just the handiest little dude? I will never not use him) Ah this was great to read! Thank you! I've been waiting for feedback like this and it feels fantastic to see! Thank you so much for taking your time too, I know that I've got a giant chunk of novel all over the place so, I'm stoked that you read through so much.\nYeah me and the 'said' issue go way back. Sometimes it's too much, sometimes not enough so I'm searching for my happy medium (and this feedback will really help me clear up some of those murky paragraphs). One of my amazing watchers recently pointed out some murk between the dialogue along those lines too so, this reinforces their feedback as well, which is amazing because I've got this first on my list when I do my first round of major edits.\nMan this is awesome, thanks a ton for your feedback, it's made my day!

The Rings Of Tinuris :: Prolouge 1 - 3 | Tapas
And here begins the Taptastic Verison of Rings of Tinuris =3. Just a heads up, the Manga is read from Right to Left. 

Warning these first few pages will be posted in different patterns accordingly. These pages have been created in different...





It has been a while since I started this comic and it has undergone several changes over the course of it's creation as well as programs used for the pages and i'm quite curious to see how I'm doing or if I should grab the eraser...^^;; You can read up to as far as you like (or up to the up to date page if you like lol) 
In exchange I'll offer an indepth review as well of your comic/story creation as well =3 I'm not a professional writer/artist by any means, but I do have experience in spotting creativity and intentions as well as offering advice. I love diving into the worlds of other stories and experiencing the dreams and wills of what the creator intends =3","['Alright, your story is very enjoyable and characters are believable but the only thing I can critique is the art. It\'s pretty off putting. Especially the shading. I recommend a harder brush (lol I would know. I had your exact same problem) and studying light sources. Some times, it\'s unclear where the light is coming from and it looks muddy. Learning ""manga"" anatomy might come in handy for the type of comic you\'re trying to make. Lastly, use hand references. They\'re life savers most of the time.\nHere\'s mine:\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nThe Residents of E. Picurus\' Mansion | Tapas\nWhen a medical instructor with no friends or family dies, he leaves his mansion to his trainee. She sees this as an opportunity to help those in need, but soon finds out the troubles that come with it.\n\n(updated every Friday)\n(edit 2: read these...\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Salutations! Okay I took a look at your comic and I\'ve got some feedback for you! I\'ve got some technicals I\'ll start with:\nYou\'ve got an opening poem that is difficult to find a pace for. Reading it out loud I wasn\'t really able to get the pace to sound right no matter how fast or slow I read it. When writing poetry you have to decide what type you want. Being aware of the stanza you\'re writing in is important if you want to write something that hooks your audience. Even if the lines don\'t all rhyme, having them in the right tempo with one another makes all the difference in readability. I\'ll make an example from your first poem to illustrate what I mean:\nOriginal: ""Shooting star, Shooting star, with your golden light,\nSoar through the heavens tonight.\nI wish, I wish, hear my heart\'s reply,\nI wish for you to Grant me my wish from upon high""\nEdited:""Shooting star with golden light,\nStriking through the sky tonight.\nIn your path a wish excite,\nFrom within my heart take flight.""\nSee the difference? A lot of that has to due with the syllables. Each line in the edited version has 7 syllables so they mirror one another and the total number of syllables comes to 28. In your original version, the first line has 6 syllables, the second has 7, the third has 9, and the fourth has 14 which works out to 36 syllables. When it comes to poetry knowing about syllables can help solve oodles of issues that can crop up. Now, this is a very basic form for poetry, and you can get more complicated as you evolve your style, but sometimes keeping it simple is the best way to go. I\'d recommend studying different forms of poetry in order to find the one that best conveys a message for your story.\nNow, I\'m sure you also noticed that some of the words in your poem where in bold. These are words that were repeated that derailed your poem. Sometimes repeated words can work in poetry but, that takes tweaking and in this case this particular poem needed more tooling. (And no, haha I wouldn\'t say you should replace it with the example one I made. It\'s just there to serve as example plain and simple.) So yeah I\'d recommend that you study poetry and stanzas and doing so will help you get a feel for more complex forms as you go along. \n Okay! On to more technicals: Now I know you\'ve got a lot of posts in here, and so I won\'t get on you too much about your earliest ones, since you\'ve improved over time. (Your lighting is smoother, your fabrics look more natural, and  your shading has also improved from the first episode to now, so kudos!) I do like that, as you\'ve improved your artwork you\'ve put a lot of effort into foreshortening and trying other angles that aren\'t straight side views or front views, you\'ve tried dynamic poses and complicated scene composition (with a city in the distance of a long road in a rolling valley) so there\'s been improvement there as well.\nNow, there\'s always room for more. In this case with your most recent episode I noticed a few things: This scene here3. So, I do like that you tried to use dynamic fighting poses but a few things knocked me out of the story. Your models seem to change height and the sizes of their heads are randomly bigger or randomly smaller. The best way to solve this inconsistency is to have a character model sheet which includes a height measure. Height measures are often made with other measurements, such as the size of the head, the torso, etc. (And most are personalized) Some show you height in terms of \'heads\'1 so I\'d find the one that works for you and maybe line up each characters on your chart to help keep them on model.\nOther than the models, one distracting thing is the upskirt shots. Now yeah, kicking in a skirt will cause things to flip up here and there but, the girl is wearing leggings so...why are her underwear on the outside of her leggings? If she\'s wearing pantyhose (which are often more see through than leggings), then her underwear should still be hard to see since they\'re underneath black pantyhose. Fact is, it is distracting and actually took me out of your story. It\'s important to consider how clothes work both in how they\'re composed and in how they function (such as how they rumple or wrinkle in different situations. A wet sweater will look different than a crumpled dry sweater).\nAlso in regards to character models, we\'re gonna hit female anatomy1 real fast. All of your female characters have a single problem that\'s also very distracting: Boobs that don\'t obey the laws of gravity. They also don\'t remain consistent in terms of size. Sometimes they\'ll be larger, smaller, flatter, etc. Like I said before, character sheets can really help solve this problem because you\'ll have a reference to pull up each time. Also, I\'d recommend learning more about female anatomy proper. This can help defeat the levitating boob problem. You\'re not the only person to run into this issue, however, it is incredibly distracting. As a reader I keep getting distracted with thoughts of ""well that\'s not possible"" so, it\'s just something to be aware of as far as readers are concerned. Like I said, this is an anatomy issue lots of people have trouble with so, as long as you know it\'s there you can fix it as you go.  \nAside from character models, though your character lighting has improved, your scene lighting in your backgrounds doesn\'t seem to exist. The character\'s don\'t really cast shadows, and the shading on their clothes doesn\'t tell me where the light is coming from. I know this seems like a small thing, but shading can REALLY buff up your scene and make your environment and character\'s pop. Now, these ARE all things that come in time, and you\'re already making good strides so don\'t worry, I\'m sure you\'ll get your backgrounds and lighting sorted as you continue to grow. To help with that, I\'ve got you some resources that can help out! Here\'s some bit on Shading1, Lighting1, Color Wheel1, character composition fundimentals1, and backgrounds1!\nOkay I know that\'s a lot of stuff to study, but you certainly don\'t have to do it all at once! It\'s just a hand full of things to use as a guide here and there whenever you need them. I hope this feedback is what you were hoping for and I hope the resources I posted helps! I wish you all the best (and congrats if you made it to the end of this thing lol).\nAlso, fair is fair. If you feel like it, you\'re welcome to check my comic out as well. \n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nThe Awlers | Tapas\n- - Updates every Monday- -\n\n~From where do Runners come,\nAnd where do Runners go?\nThe Wolpr must collect them,\nTo mend the world\'s woe.~\n\nThis story follows Mun, a munchkin kitty who seeks magic to make her into a normal sized cat and Goon, a...\n\n\n\n\n\n', ""Thank you so much for the feedback! ^^ Yea i've been experimenting with alot of lighting that at times i tend to forget the direction the light is facing ^^;;\nAs promised here are my thoughts on the 'Residents of E. Picurus' Mansion:\nI read this while I was at work, but I managed to get to the updated point. I'll have to say I was definitely hooked when I dove into the story =3 I won't say much on the art style since we all have our calibers on how we art, I believe you've executed the art very well ^^ I would say one thing as far as some of the movement between the characters in the panels, may need to be indicated to avoid confusion. Most of the action (and subtle actions like flipping hair or attitude gestures) you did mention were happening which helps a lot. It wouldn't hurt to add alittle more speed or motion lines for a combination of actions (example in the latest episode: https://tapas.io/episode/11105942 when crystal lurches out of the bed from her hand being taken, additional lines to show she suddenly jumped up from the bed would help enhance the action alittle more =3)\nOther than that, I don't have any really big issues with anything ^^ I do have to say the only one thing I would say that may need to be watched for, is panel flow and alignment. There were a few times I was confused for a moment where the panels were being read. Nothing huge but some subtle arrows would definitely help in the long run when panels are clustered on the same level =3\nOther than that. I really look forward to reading more of the story X3"", ""Wow this is alot of content! Thank you so much for the review! I'm really happy the story and the characters are okay ^^ (this was one of the mind numbing things about the story that was killing my morale ;3;) Yea, me and anatomy have been on a disagreement plan for quite a while lol but I definitely tried to make sure I don't do the balloon boob issue XD; I guess it still intends to kick my butt a few more times until I get it right. Thank you so much for the resources on that and on the background and shading...It was quite difficult to see what was damaging interest in the story and how to fix it completely. I'll do my best to correct these issues ^^\nNow for the Awlers =3 I didn't get to read too much since I was at work (alot of people wanted to see movies today XD;) but I can definitely tell you have quite the story suited up for us =3 You've created one of the ultimate tongue twists of poetry and artwork and did an excellent job of teasing the beginning of the lore and intro into the story (reminds me of Mulan alittle bit, mixed in with the Spanish/ Aztec lore) Despite I havn't read much, just from the start of the story I'm hooked in and wanting to see more ^^ What is the fated path between our lil hero and the Goon x3\nSadly I don't have any super detailed review to offer other than I'm ready to read more x3\nThanks again for the review"", ""Hey no problem, it was a lot of fun to read through and see your progress. Anatomy is just a tough thing to nail and if Rob Liefeld is any indication, it happens to artists in the industry as well. (Seriously, if you look up how he draws women, he's got no idea where hips are or that inner organs are a thing. Trust me, it happens to EVERYBODY. XD) \nAh, thank you!  I'm a lover of folklore from all over the world so, if I fall in love with something I like to bring it along. XD (Nothing wrong with chillin' out and watching movies) Hahah it's totally fine if you didn't have time to read a lot of it, there's a TON of content in there so yeah it's cool.  I'm glad that you like it though, I'm so stoked about it recently and I just can't wait to get it all done.\nYou're most welcome!"", ""Okayy!! I can say you have improved a lot!! I checked the introduction and some pages ahead, also skipped to the last pages to see the latest development! I think the intro is very engaging I love the purples of the night sky, and the shading of the spaceship is so cool! I really like your vibrant color palette. The girls have goddesses bodies, so beautiful and like their thickness. I see you improved consistency of characters, shading and the speech bubble distribution! well done! \nTo improve in the future you can practice drawing hands. I know!! they are so hard to draw!! I struggle too!! My fingers looked like they were made of  play-doh XD I had to force myself to remember that hands have bones inside and they have structure.\n Also,something I can't help to notice is that the faces...er...change place in the head. I don't know how to explain it. Lets imagine the head is a ball, and the eyes are printed at times too low, other times too high from the center. I think that when you want them to look down you simply put the eyes lower instead of drawing them in perspective. For example in your banner: the brunette of the right has a too small face compared with her head like her face was printed on the side of the  ball and too low form the center, instead of putting the features in perspective. The rest of the characters look very well! And the lights look wonderful. \n So far very entertaining! I didn't want to scroll down too much in the newer pages just for the review.  I know how hard it is to make one single page and I don't want to pass them without reading. So, I will subscribe and check them out later and catch up with the story.""]",7/2/2018 1:56,https://forums.tapas.io/t/review-request-for-my-comic-ill-review-yours-in-return/25521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cjay is infatuated with a girl in his school named Renisha. But is deathly afraid to talk to her. Will Cjay ever build up the courage to speak up?





","[""I really enjoy your art style! The color palette mixed with the dramatic shading really sets a unique tone!It's pretty clean-cut, which is good, but I found it a little odd that some of the panels would have the characters speaking with their mouths closed. In addition, given a lot of the character close-ups you do, it might be a good idea to practice conveying subtle emotions through expressions. As of now, everyone's faces look a little too stiff and serious. Adding in some flexibility to their faces can help characterize your characters and make them more relatable. \nimage.png1024x662 314 KB\nBased on how this character chooses to express himself ^^^ we get an idea about what his personality might be like. \nimage.png819x1130 1020 KB\nAnd also some Boondocks reference because I love that show's expressions ^^^"", 'Very well done.

You have a very distinct visual style, that reminds me a bit of Shadoweyes1 by Sophie Campell. The dialogue works well. When characters speak street, there is a risk that it becomes clichéed or stereotypical, but I think it feels natural here.However, I think you should take a bit more time with the backgrounds. The first panel feels a bit barren, and it looks kind of strange that so many people in the background are featureless. Drawing individual features on an entire crowd can be frustrating, and it's reasonable to make people further back featureless, but I think at least the characters who are shown head to toe should be more detailed. That being said, this comic looks really promising! The panel where Renisha turns around is especially effective!""]",6/23/2018 13:06,https://forums.tapas.io/t/short-mini-series-looking-for-reviews/25392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","[""Hey droidmonkey1! \nMy name is Vyper and here is a quick review of your comic, WDE!\n-Art-The art is pretty cute! The style works well with a comic that centers around humor. I do notice that the style you use seems to change often. I think it's a good idea to try and experiment, but too much change can be a little off putting. Personally, I liked the art style from episode 7 - 15 as I thought it best represented the lighthearted nature of your comic.\n-Writing- There are quite a few grammatical errors throughout the comic and I believe this is the biggest drawback to your comic. Luckily, this is an easy fix! Consider typing out your sentences in a Word Document or your Google Docs. Check for spelling errors and make sure to re-read your work to fix words without the proper suffixes (-ing, -ation, -ed, -ly).\n-Paneling-You have very straightforward and easy to follow paneling, which is great for a comic centering around humor. I never had to question which panel I was supposed to read next. Solid work!\n-Overall Reaction-This is a pretty cute and simple comic! I liked the silly jokes between your characters. However, some of it is hard to follow and it's mostly due to the writing. As I mentioned before, there were quite a few grammatical errors and missing words in the middle of sentences that take away from the humor. If people have to try and decipher what your characters are saying, the jokes may go over their head!\nIn the end, all that I've mentioned is only the opinion of one person. If you don't agree with what I've said, that is okay! This is your comic, do what makes you happy!\nKeep up the good work,\nTheFalseVyper"", ""Thank you very much. About the text, English isn't my native language. although I can read and talk quite well,I do have spelling and grammar mistakes that slips out, even if I'm using translators. some people notice them and tell me and I fixed them.If you could give me some examples of my mistake so I could find them before posting."", 'I commend you for having the guts to write in a different language, that\'s awesome! So I apologize if my critique was rude regarding proper grammar. \nI\'ll make the words that need to be fixed, or added, in bold.\nHere are a few of the mistakes from your most recent chapter:\nEpisode 27 - ""One centimeter to the left! One lousy centimeter to the left and he could have flown through the large, gaping opening in the roof!""\nEpisode 24 - ""Weird, it sounds like ""I gonna get you.""\nEpisode 22 - [I altered this sentence to help it flow better] ""He uploads all kinds of videos. Some include him with a sword, a banana, peanut butter, and a yoyo.""\nEpisode 21 [My personal favorite episode! ]  - ""Dr. Devilish, where were you this whole time? It\'s been days."" - ""Someone sent a Rent-a-Ninja to steal something. Luckily, I had a robotic Guard."" [Be careful about using too many commas!]\nI hope this helps!', 'It helps a lot and your critique was grate. just the right blend of ""good"" and ""bad"".Episode 27 I had trouble with ""flow"". usually I write the sentence in google search box and hope for the best. sometimes It dosen\'t sounds right.', ""I'm glad I didn't drill you too hard. I always get a little nervous when giving people critiques because I'm scared I'll drive them away from creating their content!"", ""One thing that hasn't been mentioned is, something pretty small...The art could do with some tidying. That's just because some of the art overlaps the panel gutters. It's normally not so bad but in episode 24 there's a lot of it - the texture from the background is all over the edges. At some points there's also some white pixelation around the outlines, which stand out against the background... episode 27 is one of those cases.\nThe reason seems to be that it's done in maybe MS Paint? It's not a bad program for beginners but in future consider upgrading to something like SAI (which you can actually download for free) or even CLIP studio (which is on sale very frequently for a fraction of its price)If not, just putting in the extra time to fix these little things might be necessary.\nI think you've got a good sense of 4-panel comedy writing, so you're definitely off to a strong start. A little more polish on the presentation as I mentioned and I think it would be even funnier."", ""I went over those pages and beside page 24 that I forget to clean the robots hands, I didn't notice any other bleeding or white spots..I use Photoshop and I always try to keep the gutters clean, If you could pin point it more I'll be very grateful."", ""Oh - you know the texture that's on the background? The sort of sprayed effect... it goes over the gutters to the edges. The brown layer.\nIt took me a few moments to spot it, myself."", ""I see, I din't notice it I though my screen is dirty.Thank you."", 'a couple of tips that can help with the english from a non native speaker: Translating tools sometimes make mistakes because ocassionally they fail to see the context of the phrase.\nIf you want to improve your english but lack time to do it i recommend you to download Duolingo, a free app that teaches how to write, speak and understand languages. You can set the language you want to learn and your native language, so it translates. If you practice the exercises there a few minutes everyday, your english skills will improve a lot more. I used it for portuguese and it helped me a lot when i needed to have a conversation with brazilian people.\nHope this helps!.', ""Thank you but in my case, it's different. I have spelling and grammar mistakes in both langues when I write.I can read and speak without a hitch.

(myself i put them second place under my text folder)2. try to put in a bit more work on backgrounds this can really help gain interest and establish story. where someone is can be just as important to what they are doing/saying.hope this helps. end of the day just keep enjoying your art.', 'Hmmm I think you should try to improve your writing and panels, some parts have to follow a flow so the reader won\'t get too confused\n\nThe beginning where the girl is hearing voices, the panel where there\'s a close of the mouth, is that the person who is speaking to the girl? If so, better changing it, because the reader cannot see them and might think it was the girl (this was the impression I had). \nThe first panel needs more work on the fire and the smoke, maybe adding more lines to show it\'s a fire and make the smoke kinda waving?\nThe impact of something hitting on the ground next to you should be more drastic, I have the feeling that the girl is falling backwards\nWhen you started the first chapter, and then the girl waking up, it made me confused, because it feels like the beginning was part of the dream too, but it\'s not?\nThen she knows how to use her powers when she thought it was a nightmare?\nWhen she said ""here"", did she mean the nightmare of the place she is?\nWhy is she with her hands up, when she saw the guy? \nA random guy came out of nowhere and wants the map?\n\nIt\'s very confusing, but if you add more panels about how the girl started using her powers, and learning how to manage them, and other parts, it wouldn\'t be so confusing and rushed.\nYou have a very unsual and questionable story, some parts can be cringe, but it\'s just me, don\'t feel bad because of I said here.

You clearly state who the main character is, you tell the readers that something has happened to her world, and you also set up potential plot line. Not bad!\nWhile your summary does a great job telling your readers exactly what they can expect from your story, I think it can be rewritten to become more engaging and interesting. Instead, consider this:  \n""After experiencing a life-altering crisis within her world, 14 year old Eunice is sent to another world by an unknown stranger and is assigned the seemingly simple task to ""Destroy Obsos."" Adventure and mystery pave the way for Eunice as she struggles to understand the stranger\'s words while saving her world from oblivion.""\nI took what little I knew of your comic and tried to simplify the sentences while also adding more adjectives that engage people\'s attentions. For instance, I combined your first two sentences and added ""life-altering"" before the word ""crisis"" in the hopes that it would make whatever tragedy that happened in her world sound more compelling and dramatic. I also combined the last two sentences of your summary since I felt saying ""Destroy Obsos"" twice was a little repetitive.\nKeep in mind that I don\'t know the direction your story is going, so while I can\'t directly say that my summary is necessarily ""better"" than yours, I do want you to consider altering it slightly to make it more tense sounding. I mean, the poor girl  was ripped from her world, a world that she grew up in and knows well, and is placed in some foreign land, only given the instructions ""Destroy Obsos"". That sounds pretty thrilling and terrifying! Give your readers the opportunity to feel those emotions.\n-Cover Art- This is the first example of your art your readers see, and I really like it! I love the colors you used for the background. All of the colors used for your character\'s clothing are easy on the eyes and don\'t clash with one another. Additionally, you give your readers a good opportunity to see your drawing style. And last but not least, the title is beautifully done. The colors go beautifully with the rest of the art on the page and it\'s very easy to read. \nThere are only two things I want you to consider.\nOne, I feel your main character, who the comic is about, should be larger! You made her a good size, but in comparison to some of the other characters on the page, she doesn\'t stand out nearly as much she should.\nMy second critique, which really is only a small, nit-picky thing and probably stems more from OCD, is to consider that the balance of the page is off centered. There are more people on the right side of the page than the left, leaving the left side with much more negative and unused space. This is a small issue, but I believe that by moving the boy with the red scarf and the girl with pigtails over to the left more and/or making them larger, the overall composition of the piece will improve. \n-Art-I like your anime/manga art style; it fits well with the story you\'re trying to convey and you do a great job with drawing a variety of poses. You also don\'t shy away from drawing hands, and while they aren\'t perfect, I commend you for giving it your all! Honestly, I would prefer someone drawing a disfigured hand than someone who goes out of their way to hide their character\'s hands.\nSome things I noticed, are some inconsistencies with keeping the lines from bleeding outside your panels. This happens a couple times and can make your comic seem less professional and also make your readers feel that you just don\'t care enough to clean up your pages. There is also one instance where Eunice wakes up from her dream in Chapter 1 (Pg 8-11) and you can see that some of the panel is visible through her shirt.\nThe few perspective shots of Eunice\'s arm are a little awkward, as well as image of Eunice summoning the tornado (which I thought the tornado was excellently drawn and super awesome looking, nice!). Consider looking up more references for scenes like this and continue developing your skills.\nI challenge you to draw more backgrounds! Most of the time, I wasn\'t certain of the setting. It\'s fine to have blank backgrounds every now and then, but don\'t be afraid to draw, at the very least, an outline of houses behind people to continue to show your readers where your characters are. \n-Paneling- Your paneling style is awesome! You use a mix of boxes and diagonal lines to keep the pages unique and interesting. It was also super easy to follow along with which panel comes next. Paneling can be pretty complex and confusing for most creators, but your panels flow from one to another really well. Honestly, I don\'t really have much to critique on this subject. Great work!\n-Writing-I won\'t say I\'m a grammar Nazi, but I can appreciate people that use the proper spellings of ""your/you\'re"" and ""their, they\'re, there"", so thank you SO VERY MUCH that you know the differences between these spellings. Your sentences were easy to read and flowed well. I didn\'t have to work hard to interpret your meanings. Great work!\nThe only thing I found awkward about the text was the font used for Chapter 1: ""I\'m Going to Destroy Obsos!"" There is a large gap between the ""I"" and the ""m"" and it\'s a little distracting. This happens a couple more times following the apostrophes in ""gold\'s"", ""it\'s"" and ""we\'re"". \nRegarding your text boxes, I found it difficult at times to clearly understand who was talking when. When the girls were fighting over the map on the last update, I couldn\'t tell who the dialogue belonged to. Try and clear this up by adding a tail to text boxes and have them point to the speaker, preferably in the general direction the speaker\'s mouth is located.\n-Plot- You have an interesting concept, though I wouldn\'t say it\'s original. The trope of ""getting sent to another world"" has been used countless times before, however this is not a complaint. Tropes are popular for a reason. People like them! This is an opportunity for you to take something that has been done before and convert it into something unique and original. You\'re already diverging from the trope by making Eunice sent on a mission to ""Destroy Obsos"" in order to save the world she was originally from (or so I\'m assuming?). \nStarting off with the dream was interesting, but I found it strange and out of place how Eunice instantly assumes the first guy she sees after waking up could be Obsos. It was also strange that she so willingly followed the orders of her dream, and used her newly gifted magic to start attacking a random man with a tornado of fire.\nThe fight over the map was awkward. I wasn\'t sure why these two girls were fighting so hard over a map which doesn\'t have any significance to us as readers. I understand that Eunice just wants to give the map back to the man, but she thought the man was Obsos not five seconds earlier. It seems strange she is willing to fight someone else over the map. The monster that attacked the village seemingly came out of nowhere, and the map that was so important a moment ago is ripped and then left behind as though it no longer has any significance, which is a little off putting. \nOn the flip side, your story is still really new and many of the things that I\'ve commented on could be explained later!\n-Overall Opinion-Personally, I like the concept. There is a lot of potential for this comic. The art isn\'t bad and your writing is easy to read. I\'m a huge fan of the whole ""adventuring with a group of people to destroy some big bad something/someone"" plot.\nHowever, it\'s too soon for me to say whether I like it or not. I\'d have to see more updates to truly know if this is something I would want to continue reading. \nIn the end, all that I\'ve mentioned is only the opinion of one person. If this isn\'t the direction you want to take your comic, then that\'s okay! This is your comic, and you should do what makes you happy! Though I hope some of my words were helpful.\nKeep up the good work,\nThe False Vyper', ""Thanks for the feedback! @TheFalseVyperI'll try to explain parts and edit the pages that are confusing!"", 'I hope my advice helped!', 'TheFalseVyper mentioned your backgrounds need a little more, and I agree. You can definitely omit them in favour of atmospheric visuals or complete blank white, but there\'s a logic (pattern) to it that needs to be observed. These are typically panels where in this point in the story, it calls for a focus on the character and what they may be feeling. It can also be necessary to omit if the background might make it visually difficult to read what\'s happening. (Ever noticed how a lot of manga artists will erase a white outline around a character? That\'s another idea.) \nHowever every few panels you do need to remind the reader of time/ space location (even if they\'re in the same area) so keep an eye out for too many blanks. Backgrounds are also critical to re-introduce for scene changes.\nThe hardest thing here is I\'m going to talk about adding more detail, but I\'m going to clarify that I only mean it in the sense of when and where it\'s relevant to have complete backgrounds (or in panels where you are alluding to some environment rather than completely drawing it out, the following will still be relevant.) \nYour environments thus far are fairly static. #1 rule for visually interesting compositions (because it draws from real life) is variety. Variety is the spice of life, and if art imitates life, it must therefore include variety! Next time you leave the house, try to notice all the diverse styles of architecture. Compare your house to your neighbour\'s. They may often have a similar overall style but will have notable differences that set them apart. It can be as simple as mixing some square houses in your street pictures with some apartment style blocks, or rectangular ones. The variety rule applies to all types of construction. Even simple pavement can have alternating patterns that might mark an interesting feature in a wider area such as a fountain, or can be laid in symmetrical rectangles that border an otherwise chaotic irregular body.  (Extreme example:)\n\n\n1\nYou can make your enviroments look infinitely more interesting even if they\'re kept simple just by changing the style of each type of object. (This includes flora. The only time you will naturally find a green space that is only occupied by one type of species is planned landscaping, such as strip down the middle of a road. Forests may be dominated by one type of tree but it\'s extremely rare that it is the only kind.)\nAs far as the the comic panelling layout goes, I get the feeling that some shapes and panels themselves are a bit superfluous. \nOn ""Chapter 1 (Pg8-11) ""I\'m going to destroy Obos"", the second panel is redundant in that it only severs as a white space for the character to make a \'pop out\' effect on. In this case I feel more attention could be drawn to her by omitting that panel border entirely. She already /is/ the next panel, and the black border conflicts with her black hair. I\'m looking at empty space rather than her first. A tip for the first panel too, the close up on the eye. Why not utilize all that space you gave yourself and make it even closer and more detailed? Make those types of panels really ""eye-catching"" by giving them some extra oomf with detail and full use of the panel.\nThird panel was a good choice for the composition of the illustration, no problems with it. Moving on from making use of space available the next thing I want to touch on is choice of panel shape. I really like panel #9 with the close up of her face/ eyes. This shape works perfectly for the angle you chose. In some others though, I\'m getting the vibe that the panel shapes were chosen maybe to break up the squares rather than having some sort of flow with the action or angles within the scene. The latter is really what should be determining the panel shape. You\'ll often hear people say that these sort of trapezoid shapes are only used in action scenes in manga. Which yes, they can really accentuate a line of action. I don\'t think their use is really that strict personally, I just advise thinking more about why you\'re using unique shapes and what is it in the scene that you\'re using them to accentuate. They have their purpose but just remember this too, squares and rectangles are more of the \'natural\' camera. It\'s not wrong at all to have a page full of them if it\'s what works best for the scenes. (Think of squares/ rectangles as being neutral and trapezoids as being high or mild energy in terms of visual flow.)\nTo touch a bit on the story. You picked a trope to work with (which is not an easy feat by any means) so one thing to keep in mind is making sure to treat it as it\'s own unique world and avoiding reading like it\'s beat-for-beat as every other story within this genre. Some ideas to play with for characters being sent to other worlds is - why not have it not known to the audience? You could start in the middle of the story to a point where the character is still relatively new to the world but spent enough time to look like everything that\'s happening is normal within it\'s own context. That sets up a plot twist right there. Be really careful in general of having to treat your characters like they know someone is reading what they\'re saying. Having them say things like ""Another vision, I\'ve been getting these since I\'ve been transported by that guy"" is pretty immersion breaking.\nThe character knows what happened to her and since we just witnessed it ourselves, we don\'t need it explained to us. Always make sure they act and think naturally. The audience will figure out everything as they go along, don\'t sweat about having to \'hook\' people. Someone being sent somewhere to another dimension is already explanation enough that the character is out of their element. And I suppose this is just me, but if you do choose to start the story before they get sent. Spend some time developing this character for us in their regular context before sending them on a journey elsewhere, so we have a deeper reason to care. I don\'t really advise starting on such high notes because you\'re forcing the reader to care about the world and characters when nothing has really been established yet. Think about it this way, if it\'s extremely common for girls to be sent through portals to another dimension, show us what makes yours unique rather than just starting with the event itself. (I would highly suggest a character focus.)\nThe 12 Kingdoms might be a series worth watching. It more or less follows the general formula for a highschool girl being sent to another dimension. But the highly character driven plot still pulls you in regardless. What makes them interesting is the characters are extremely, extremely flawed at the start and the payoff is following them through their journey as they learn about this new world and most importantly, themselves.', 'I\'m gunna suggest another idea after considering Vyper\'s point on the plot. Without changing anything thus far you could work with Eunice\'s flaw by exacerbating it in that she\'s someone who\'s not quite taking this whole ""being in another world"" thing seriously. She was just given magic and is treating it like a toy, having never had it before. She\'s making wild assumptions, attacking people, not feeling remorse for doing so and by the time it dawns on her that she is really stuck here and this is a real world with real thinking, feeling breathing, people, she has no support network. This makes it even harder for her to survive here and she reflects, realizing she\'s going to need to make up to people in order to live here and achieve her objectives.']",6/9/2018 0:35,https://forums.tapas.io/t/help-on-how-i-can-improve/25148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","[""I've read your novel and honestly I love it.Your writing style is simple yet efficient, the only thing I find a bit lacking (and that's only because I tried hard to find something) is your descriptions. You could try and get a little more descriptive of the backgrounds, what does Kanna's Coffe Shop look like? What king of lighting, what colors are dominant etc?Same goes for the Lake, it's supposed to be beautiful but all that we know is that it's huge...Other than that, I got completely caught up in your story and I really feel empathy for all your characters (except the dad, but that's because we don't know much about him yet). Your theme is solid and interesting, and I really can't wait to read more! Keep up the good work!\nAs for mine if you'd like to give me feedback (no obligation but it would be greatly appreciated), here it is : \n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nAbby's Hope | Tapas\nWhen I wrote that book, I had no idea how big it would get.

Lucella is one of those blurred lines, working reluctantly to clean up problems that might...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'Salutations! \nI\'ve read through some of your work and I\'ve some feedback for you! \nGood on you for starting your prologue with some action to get the reader invested. It is never a bad thing to start in the middle of something thrilling.\nNow, I know you\'ve heard this twice already but to reinforce its importance: your descriptions are lacking (take heart, they\'re not horrible, they just need a little more meat on their bones). Remember, you\'re having to show us the world you\'re building. You don\'t have to go into Purple Prose territory, but it would help readers to become more ingrained if their other senses are engaged. So I\'d suggest involving textures, smells, lighting, weather (humidity, dryness etc), and so on. This will give you a tangible feel. You don\'t have to stop the narrative to provide this info, but adding in bits here and there that give your audience the \'feel\' of your scene can really bolster your readers all around experience.\nOne thing I also noticed right from the off, is that you\'ve run into the \'Passive Voice\' problem. Passive Voice is essentially telling instead of showing. You can end up in a situation where your narrative feels rushed and passed over due to the use of adverbs (-ly words) and instances of \'was\', \'while\', \'but\' and, \'because\'. The best thing you can do to fix some of these issues is use -ed words and minimize usage of fluff words. I\'ll use an example from your own text to illustrate my point:\nOriginal: He quickly turned around and made his way back to room thirteen where he enjoyed his aunt\'s surprisingly delicious packed lunch in peace and quiet. Kaito made sure to stuff as much food as he could in his mouth because he knew once the bell chimed again he would have to make his way to the next classroom, which for all he knew, could be on the other side of this giant glass enclosure.\nEdited: He turned and made his way back to room thirteen. He enjoyed the steamed vegetables and rice his aunt packed for him in peace and quiet, surprised at how delicious it all was. Kaito stuffed his face in record time; once the bell chimed again he\'d have to sprint to the next classroom, which for all he knew, could be on the other side of campus.\nThe edited paragraph states the same as the first, but the word count has been reduced and only the necessary words are included. Removing fluff words tightens the narrative and enhances your reading flow. Now, these are things that everybody does once they get into their major editing phases, so don\'t worry! You\'ll get to it. Also, like I said, beware usages of -ly. These words can take your action out of the moment and turn it into a story told from a distance instead of from the character\'s perspective. You don\'t want to lose the direct line between your protagonist and your audience. \nAnother thing that immediately brought me out of the story was this bit right here: \n""Guess I\'m late for class... It\'s my first day at this school... It shouldn\'t be a problem.""\nThis is a cliche and it immediately bumped me from your story. I cannot tell you how many books, cartoons, anime, manga, slice-of-life genre works start with the main character being late on their first day in a new school. It\'s almost synonymous with starting the story waking up from a bad dream, or a character looking in a mirror to describe themselves to the audience. Because of its overuse people immediately make bad associations to the trope (despite how good your story might be). This is something to be aware of when you go into your editing phase.\nI will say I did like the very Midsummer Night\'s Dream moment with Miyu and Kaito on either side of the wall. I thought that was a funny scene and it rounded out their characterizations and those of their guardians. Kaito\'s aunt is more relaxed and casual and Miyu\'s father has a broken heart; how they interact with their kids in these little moments is a nice touch. \nUnfortunately the aforementioned scene then leads into another area where things fall off for me: the \'bully\' character, Ace. He feels like a caricature instead of a character. From the \'instant bully status\' to the puffed up \'better watch your back\' speech, the interest I\'d been building off of the interactions of Kaito and his family, were derailed by this scene. Since we haven\'t really seen Kaito do anything to rub him the wrong way, it just seems cartoonish that a random bully would say \'hey new kid, watch your back!\' without provocation. If there was something about Kaito, a rumor or something he\'d done inadvertently (or who knows, Kaito has an attitude, maybe something he did on purpose) before this point, then it would feel more like a solid scene. As it stands, it just feels out of nowhere and very stock. When you do your editing phase, you might want to include an inciting incident before this, so that when this scene comes into play, Ace has a reason to start harassing Kaito, thereby adding some tension to the scene.\nAnother thing that I\'ve noticed (and this is not just with your novel. This is a thing many novels that involve going to school have a problem with) is the clip at which your school days are over. I don\'t feel like Kaito is in school, because every day is the same thing: don\'t be late, find Touma, have a conversation/one event, go home, repeat. Granted, sitting through class IS boring, but outside of Kaito\'s friends and the fact that he\'s afraid of being late, I don\'t really feel like his school life where all of his friends are, has meaning. It all feels like it\'s being used as quick preamble to push plot points. (And to get him to the music club as fast as possible). Often times, we forget that our environments are sometimes characters too. \nAn example of this is in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The club room where they held all their meetings, scheming and activities (or prep for activities) took on a life of its own. (Now, this anime and light novel weren\'t my favorite things in the world, however, I did feel that the club room was very much a character and how each person used it both with others or alone, filled the space with its identity.) Sometimes a character would want to be alone, so they\'d get to the room early and spend time with their thoughts, then someone would walk in and the atmosphere would change. Or, Haruhi would be doing something crazy and people would walk into a typhoon of ruckus. Either way, you\'d have a feeling about the room you were going to enter.\nTo take this idea to the larger scale of encompassing an entire school: Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu involved classes, characters, principals, school and military officials. The school was the center of the action as the main character had to try and figure out what it meant to be a normal person (rather than a trained military captain who had no childhood) and where he figured that out was with the normal people he interacted with and the outrageous situations he put them in, all on school grounds. The school itself became a character, as you know when going in that you\'re going to spend the day with a paranoid ex-military captain searching his locker for booby-traps (when, in actuality, he got a valentine). The school itself felt like it involved the audience and so, when I think back to Fumoffu, the school is the first place I think of.\nAnd yes, I do realize I used anime references but, your work reads like a light novel and has very anime-like elements in it, so I figured these references could be good ones. Examples of environments acting as characters in books can be found in Harry Potter (because Hogwards very much was a character), The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, and Miss Perigrin\'s Home for Peculiar Children. That\'s just a hand full but, you get the idea. The environment needs to play a role so your setting feels tangible to your readers.\nAs such, maybe seeing instances of Kaito slipping notes back and forth in one of his classes, or we see him interact with Touma or Himari in different classes early on so we feel like we\'re in his life with him. These are just ideas to consider when you do your major editing. How you want your audience to interact with your atmosphere and so on. Like I said, these are things that happen to EVERYBODY on their first few drafts so, you\'re by no means outside the norm here. It\'s important to get your ideas out and on the page so you can come back and refine later. As such, I\'ve got some tools to help you out in that department! Alrighty the first is this guy: Editminion! This is a tool that identifies instances of adverbs, passive voice, weak words, cliches, homonyms and so on. It\'s a great little editing buddy that you can use to catch some of the small stuff that\'s easy to lose track of when you do your big edits.\nHere\'s a quick overview of scene elements that can help you tighten up your narrative as you edit. Here\'s some examples of Active and Passive Voice, to help you identify them when editing. Overall I actually think you\'ve got a sweet story here, the journey back to humanity for two people who have suffered and who have to learn to love others and themselves again. I think you\'ll carry this story far, all the editing will do is make what\'s already awesome shine. \nAaaaaaaaaand if you\'ve survived until the end of this thing, huzzah! You lived!  I hope this feedback helps you and I wish you the best of luck as you go forward.  Also, fair is fair, I\'ll post the link to mine as well.

A violent start usually captures my interest, and the contrast between mundane violence (the abusive boyfriend), and monster attack gives it a unique feel. The art style is original and underground, but sometimes a bit hard to follow. I would recommend you to use thicker lines. That way it would be easier for the reader to make out objects and people. Maybe have a few objects be in color, like red blood or something? It can be a cool effect sometimes, but it's easily overused. As for the characters, it's a bit early to tell, but I think that the main characters (whom I assume are the scientists) need to be more thoroughly introduced fairly soon.

I'm glad you're able to tell what's going on; I was so worried that it was too ambiguous.\nI wasn't sure what exactly was going to happen in the first episode, but by the second, I was hooked! (I'm guessing something is going to interfere with their escape attempt and prolong their journey)\nThe traditional art is beautifully colored, and your style is cute and charming, but works well for an adventure story.\nWhat I admire most is your world-building! Too often, sci-fi and fantasy stories have very artificial expositional dialogue sprinkled in at the wrong times, but your expository dialogue was funny and felt smooth and realistic. I also like that you didn't rely entirely on dialogue, and showed instead of telling. (e.g. the confiscation of sugary snacks)\nImprovements you could make include planning your complex dialogue balloons more carefully (you have already improved this greatly, so keep it up!) and making sure we readers get a sense of personality from each important character (I am getting a sense of Nora's personality, but I don't know what to think of Ester yet) but you have a lot of time to get this in and it really doesn't always show at the beginning. (And I, myself, am guilty of not doing this very well outside of character comedies.)\nKeep up the good work and thank you for sharing!"", ""Thank you!I'm glad you enjoyed the world-building! (Been afraid of boring people with it.) You're right, the balloons are kind of all over the place, I need to plan those better. And I'll try to show more of Ester's personality. I can't just go with my own image of her personality without communicating it to the readers."", 'I\'m a fan of the art style you have going on here! Some of the panels are really captivating when you add in the extra lines for that ""sketchy"" feel. I\'d recommend experimenting more with your line work, given that you don\'t really have to worry about color. Some of my favorite panels are the close up shots you do, it\'s a great way to establish tension. However, do be careful about overusing them, or else they lose their effect. From time to time, instead of focusing on grotesque expression, try conveying emotion with different types of close-ups, a composition shift, a zoom-in on a tense fist. There are so many other ways to convey how a character is feeling than just through their face.\nI\'ve got to agree on adding a little color here or there. For instance, when the police cars arrived, I actually wasn\'t certain what the ""eeeeee"" sound effect was until I checked the description. Adding in some red and blue siren lights in some of the panels would\'ve made the police cars more evident, and created a striking contrast. \nAll in all, it\'s a neat comic, there aren\'t any pressing issues with it, paneling\'s good, dialogue is easy to follow, pictures are clear.If I had one qualm it would be to mind your update schedule. Since your episodes are only a page long, and the story strongly relies on tension, a lot of tension can end up getting lost in the week long wait. That\'s just my two cents though. If you really want to improve, I\'d suggest studying some other successful horror comics. ""Bastard"" and ""Sweet Home"" were great at nailing suspense if you wanna check that out:\n\nwebtoons.com2\n\n\n\nBastard\nThere is a serial killer in my house!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwebtoons.com\n\n\n\nSweet Home\nA reclusive high school student is suddenly forced to leave his home due to an unexpected turn of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you have the time, I\'d appreciate it if you could review my comic too!\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nTrust Me | Tapas\nA story of siblings struggling in an unjust world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it ever gets boring, you can just skip until the last arc.

","[""I love the little tinges of colour in the otherwise monotone comic, and the action sequence are really swift and builds the momentum. However, it was kind of difficult to determine which is the next panel.I suggest you space the panels a little bit more, so that the images don't get too jumbled up. Don't get me wrong, I like the aesthetic of the images jutting out of the panel, but too many in one succession will only lead to confusion.\nAnd I think the action scenes will look more impactful and intense if the action lines (lines signifying movement and intensity) are bolder and more numerous.Also as a side note, I noticed that you didn't use punctuations in the dialogues. Punctuations are crucial in distinguishing one sentence from another, and also injecting emotions into narrative, so I suggest you fix that too.\nI'm looking forward to more of your works!"", ""Thank you very much really appreciate it...

As for Sage's Sunset I think you're selling yourself a little short there. I'm really loving the world building you've got going on so far and you're paneling is nice and tight. The first few pages I was kinda feeling like there should be more value but then I saw in the later pages that you started putting a lot of focus on those strong shadows and I think it works really well. Especially that scene on the cliff where you just see that steep drop off. I'm looking forward to more of it!"", ""Thank you! I really like the setup you've got going on here, like, I'd really like to know what lead to the whole event that ruined their relationship (trying to avoid spoilers here XP). I feel like doing some studies of construction would go a long way for your figures. Like I can already tell that you're going for these different body types and it comes across well -- your characters are all really distinct -- but I think taking some time to focus on learning the form of the human body in three dimensions will give it that extra push towards fast improvement (which isn't that what all us artists desire?). This next part is something I'm fairly bad at, but your dialogue can feel a little unnatural at times (I'm really bad at this myself, I mean it's kinda why so many of the early pages that I have contain so much cursing), something that helps me with this is to read my character's lines aloud. Overall, I think you've got a really interesting and personal (meaning like it's all about these people interacting with each other and that stuff) story building here and I'm really looking forward to seeing it grow!"", ""Like I said in my response to Lortia I'll try out the motion lines once action starts back up, maybe doing something like smear frames in animation would be pretty fun. Speaking of fun, BRA. I remember back when I was in a high school for the super powered, sorry I think the politically correct term is differently powered. I was just your average killer android/vampire/merman. Lol, anyway I love it when the main characters of a story are kinda pathetic, but sooooo full of themselves. You've got a nice cast of characters forming here and I'd like to see some more character building for them (like what are they up to when they're not ruining everyone else's day?). Art wise I think watching some stuff like Sycra's tutorials would help point out where and how to improve. I really like how you're putting backgrounds into pretty much all of your panels (that's something I've just recently started trying to do better with the last couple pages), but it's a little jarring when you have the 3d modeled backgrounds thrown in with the mix ya know? I think if you wanna use assets like that it might be really helpful both visually and learning wise to try recreating the 3d environment yourself (be it using the environment as a reference image or even tracing over it). Overall, I'm a sucker for supernatural school settings and I'd really like to see what these guys do when they're not obsessing over girls!"", 'Wow, sorry about those text walls. I gotta remember to use paragraphs.', ""Thank you so much! Yes, I'm so aware of it sounding unnatural so I guess I'll try what you said. After all, improvement goes a long way!

That's basically what happens but not for those motives. (no more spoilers lol) Also, don't forget to subscribe! I upload every Friday"", ""Hi! Good luck with the launch!I thought the pacing was pretty good. There is a nice balance between text and art, and the story is moving along at a good clip while still being easy to understand. The pacing and panel layout during the jacket scene were perfect. It would have been nice to linger on the black star at the beginning for just a bit though. How do other townspeople feel about it? What does the town itself even look like? I'm not asking for an infodump by any means, but an establishing shot of the town and a few scenes of life there would make it easier to get immersed into the world. While the character anatomy is a bit off sometimes, especially the hands and faces in profile, the characters are very expressive and distinctive, which is great.

So real quick I'm just gonna say thank you all for your input, I definitely agree with the anatomy being off in a lot of shots, it's something I'm trying to improve on with the newer pages, and yes Hamlet is an asshole. He should start to get a little better now that Aiva's around to put him in his place.

Art wise I really like it, everyone is really expressive and you can see that a lot of care has gone into this so far. \nI do think the backgrounds are a little lacking in places and I get a feeling that you can do better with that because of the scenes where you show off the cityscape in the background. There are also a few scenes where I think the poses could've better conveyed the scene (Namely when the black cat [I don't think I ever actually learned his name, unless it's just Dude] is holding onto Trip it kinda looks like he's not using too much effort to hold him up).\nI really like how you switch between the a and b plot, it never feels out of place or like we change viewpoints too much/little.

The cover and the first page both showcase spectacular art, and the opening scene is intriguing and contains just the right amount of world info and hints of what's to come. It's both strange and familiar, especially the part where the Traveller explains his name. I also think it's a good thing to show the MC's homelife at an early stage. As for the art, the anatomy and expressions are flawless, the coloring looks professional and fits the tone of the story, and the backgrounds feel real.\nThe blue-gray color scale can feel a little oppressive after a while, but maybe it's going to be a bit like in The Wizard of Oz when she enters this other world?

I feel a colder color palette could help emphasize Destiny's sense of loneliness and isolation better. Also, you have some really clever uses of paneling! The golden rectangle on page 10 was especially clever.\nI feel the pacing of the story is a bit fast for my taste. While you definitely are able to establish the main characters and premise well in just a few pages, I feel having a bit more time spent on establishing atmosphere would benefit this story a lot. A major appeal of your story at this point is the strangeness and mysteriousness of it all, it would be nice if you let your readers have a little more time to linger and take in the oddity of it all. It's hard to make an actual assessment on the characters and story at this point, since it's so early in, but you have a solid groundwork for whatever direction the story will go in!\nHere's my webcomic.

I love the premise of Sage's Sunset. You introduce a lot of tantalizing questions -- why is Cebyr the last sage owl? Who is Father? What manner of monster have they unleashed? I also like how you have a sage owl as the protagonist, as I'm tired of seeing just elves and dwarves all the time. Very interesting concept with great potential!I can already see improvement over the span of a few pages, especially in your use of spot blacks, and your backgrounds are nicely detailed. I did find the dialogue to be a little awkwardly worded at times -- reading it aloud helps. I'd also recommend visiting Blambot.com for a more natural looking font -- they have lots of free ones you can download. Lastly, if you're using Photoshop or something similar, you can use the transform tool to squash ellipses around the text a little for nicer-looking word balloons. Thanks again, and good luck!"", ""Thanks! Here's a review for you...I can't say a lot about the storytelling of Pitch Black, as we're only two pages in, but starting with an epic battle never hurts! You have some very dynamic compositions, and I like the contrast between white and black. The panel where spiky hair guy is punching the demon made me chuckle, given how tiny spiky hair guy is by comparison. The hands are consistently drawn too small, but the faces look really good!One thing I can point out is the punctuation. There should be periods at the ends of sentences, and there were a lot of missing commas and apostrophes. It sounds like a really minor nitpick, but even something as minor as a missing period can pull a reader out of the story.There isn't much posted yet, but what you have so far is great.

And yes, I am going for a Wizard of Oz colour scheme change in the future. Drat, you discovered my dark secret  I'm already a fan of your comic. At first the characters looked a little off -- the bulbous noses freaked me out, I guess -- but after a page the character designs started to grow on me, and now I find them really charming. One commenter said they reminded them of Herge's Tintin comics, and I have to agree. Their bodies look a little wibbly sometimes, but careful construction drawing and practice will help with that. The character's interactions are equally charming, and also really funny, in an offbeat and quirky way. I love your sense of humour.While the panels are sometimes a bit cramped and the colours maybe a little too oversaturated for my tastes, you know when to pull back with a big, richly detailed panel. The level of detail in these establishing shots is just amazing, and the bright colours really work for them. Speaking of colours, do you colour with markers? Madness! I would not have the patience for that."", ""Thanks for the kind words! I loved the prologue to Burning Shadows.

Dragons make everything awesome.Art-wise, I've noticed that you leave the backgrounds as paintings, while rendering only characters and close objects with lineart. This can be a great method for separating backgrounds from characters and for implying depth. Fiona Staples (the artist of Saga) uses this method, and the results are mindblowing. Problem is, it's difficult to pull off. Sometimes your backgrounds are a little too blurry and a little too smudged, and they look like they don't match the rest of the art. Just keep practicing! I haven't mastered this technique either, but we gotta keep trying. I liked how you start with a mystery (sketchy dude), and I loved the pacing and panel layout for the flying scene. I've always wanted to be able to fly..."", ""Actually now that I switched things around, I have to agree it's a lot better.

I want to improve more than anything, and your feedback really helped. I was actually worried that I was moving too slowly and boring everybody, so it's good to know that I can ease up and take my time.As for Dr. Goodlove, it's top-notch. The art is expressive, the pacing is perfect, and the writing is snappy. I especially love the characterization -- Dr. Goodlove is a hilarious take on the mad scientist trope, and I found it easy to like and empathize with Rudolf. Also, the moment where Rudolf gets hit by a car is brilliant comedic timing.Hm.. if I had to suggest an improvement, I'd say that Rudolf could be a little more proactive. He mostly just reacts to everything that happens to him, and the one time he does take initiative and runs away, he is very quickly rescued. It's not bad by any means -- he is a rather passive person, and he's still in shock -- but it would have been cool to have him get into more trouble first, or maybe to see him piece together what happened to him before Good love explains it all. Honestly, though, I really had to stretch to find critique. This is really high-quality work. I'm seriously impressed."", ""Wow, that looks much better already! I can see you're driven to improve, and that's awesome. I seriously respect that."", ""Thanks man, yeah I'm pretty serious about this, I'm in a bad spot with my work and seeing how this is my outlet I'll keep practicing and just work to get into something a lot more satisfying. \nSure this comic isn't my best work, but as a learning experience? Jeez I've only been doing this for half a year, learning new stuff every day and meeting awesome new people on the way.

I'll have to think about not cramming too many panels into a page, and too much stuff into small panels.

You do great with the layouts of your pages and the way you seamlessly incorporate worldbuilding without bogging down the reader is great. (The girls talking about Travelers as Des walks away.) You show a lot of detail without using too much dialogue or captioning too. I'm glad you're showing Des's home life since that's going to be great for contrast later on. I love the teacher trying to write the Traveler's name and the dog. I personally don't feel that there's any problem with the pacing so far, as the others have mentioned, since all that's really happened so far is Des seeing the new kid and going home to study. If more had happened then I'd say the pacing was off. The tone is really dreary and some poses are a little bit awkward, but generally I didn't find anything that stuck out at me or bothered me. \nMy comic is entirely traditionally drawn, with only a bit of digital touch ups, and the image quality varies sometimes since I don't have a scanner.

Yeah, awkward poses are something I have a lot of trouble with. I'm surprised that you're the first to mention them, haha.Minou and Cu Sith is just... it's so cute. Just ridiculously cute. Minou and Cu Sith are both really likeable, and they have very interesting and unique character designs. I love how the flesh golem ended up looking like a squishy teddy bear. The gags are pretty funny and the dialogue feels natural.One thing that bothered me a little were the panel borders. They're really thick and chunky and angry-looking, and the characters -- who are drawn with much lighter line work -- get a little lost. The line work for the characters doesn't really vary a lot, and it looks a little scratchy in places. Line work looks best when you use confident strokes, and when you thicken the lines outlining characters, as well as lines that are in shadow. I'd experiment with grayscale more too, to give your characters depth. I have trouble with inking myself.. just takes practice, I guess.What I liked most about your comic was how you combined a slice-of-life gag strip with a high fantasy setting. It's an interesting juxtaposition that I haven't seen often before, and it really works. I've seen so many two-gamers-on-a-couch comedies, so summoned tentacles and flesh golemancy are a refreshing change."", ""What's up! As for the review, you have a pretty good comic. everything is good and  the story is compelling however the only critiques I have are in art. I really like the first chapter panel where you introduced the school and I really really like how you made the strange boy look cute to us but strange to them. Sometimes your perspective can be a bit off like in the panel where she's walking away it looks like she is huge since the other classmate's heads are in the corner.

A young mercenary in training discovers the darkness in his own soul and soon has to decide to protect his loved ones or fall in to the evil of his post apocalyptic world.





","[""Hey! I seem to be the only one here lol. Anyway, I like your art style because it brings back old memories of Dragon Ball z but there are some critiques. First, some faces should have more emotion. Like the guy being surprised. He didn't look so surprised as he did annoyed. Then, there are the blurry lines but that's a minor inconvenience. Lastly, maybe learn more anatomy on how the arms work and hands. I struggle with this too so I don't have many tips on that. Here's my series:\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nThe Residents of E.

I will argue @kirschwassen and say that I think the pacing works well! I think the line work scan could be improved though. The lines are great, but they look like they are drawn in Paint, due to the levels being pushed too far (probably to hide your pencil work). There are some frames that don't look as over-exposed, and those lines stand out against the others. I'm not sure how to fix this, as I struggle with scan resolutions as well, but I'm sure you'll find something that works.\nAs well, I feel like your half-tones are a little busy looking.

The pixelation isn't a real problem in those... \nAs for your comic I like it.. It has some nice art and it has it's own personality and connects with the story well.. the paneling is good and is easy to follow along.. Not sure if this is a stylistic choice but the shaky lines in someof the backgrounds bug me and pull me from the story a little bit. it'd b a little better with a crisper and more straight line.

Good luck"", ""@kirschwassen Thanks for the reviewsome of the stuff you brought up I questioned myself and I will work on fixing these flaws in the future..\nFirst off I love the initial page with the flashing image part.. It's pretty cool.. I haven't seen too many webcomics do that.. The paneling is a little wonky to me and a bit confusing sometimes. Your expressions are little Wierd and make alot of characters seem tired or just out of it.. The coloring in this helps connect with the story and everything has a futuristic sleek look to it. This is good.. but the color makes some imperfections in the proportions more noticeable.. Overall I think this is a pretty good comic and could become better overtime.. I'd love to see where you take this in the future"", 'Good to hear you worked out the pixelation! I may also be harping on it, because I often scrutinized it when I tried scanning my own works...', 'Hey there! Your comic looks pretty cool as far as I have read, the synopsis seems very promising and keeps you waiting to know more. The bubbles are very nice looking and the lettering is great, it helps to make the reading more smooth.About the art style, I like the way you draw faces, it seems that you have worked on them so the front views and the side views don’t seem off. If I had to say something it’s that sometimes the anatomy on full body looks weird, I feel that the arms are too thin and the hands look small.

You work creatively and effectively with black, (which is suitable considering the title). The design of the MC is really cool (the large image on page 5 is just awesome), but I think the two people who are rescued seem a bit visually underdeveloped. (Of course this is only an issue if they're going to be recurring characters.) The aesthetics are cool and reminiscent of Dragon Ball. One small nitpick I have are the occasional white backgrounds.

In a way the world atm is breaking down and in the next few pages i post you will see what i mean. The anatomy is an oversight that i didnt address since this series is reuploaded.. The first 12 pages f this was made in 2015 and posted in 2016. Only thing i have up so far thats new is the colored cover. Up until a few months ago i didnt work on it and now im trying to bring it back.. The later pages have way better art and as for the current pages flaws im going to keep them just show my progression in the later pages. Definitely will take all the critiques to heart and try to improve what i make going forward.\nfirst off the art in the prologue is great. It seems very well thought out and is the strongest art in your comic so far.  The lore surrounding the story is nice and not too long and gets to the point and helps set up your world well. Im not a big fan of the cover. The title could use some work too and  the cover would look better if you made it like you did the prologue. Some of the lines are pretty shaky and seems like you made this digitally. Ithink some of the background would be better if you had more crisp linework.  The panels are nice and arent too hard to keep up with.Overall you have a good idea but needs to be tweaked a lil bit but overtime you will improve as long as you support the series. Btw The cloak wings are something i really like and is a nice touch to your protagonist. I thought of doing that but never got to it so its nice to see someone else attempt it.', 'Thanks for the critique. I understand where you are coming from and my comics first pages fall victim to being two years old.  I made minor adjustments to the first 12 pages but all the later pages are made this year and should hopefuly be looking better. I wanted to keep it overall the same to show my progression as i post more pages. I will definitely take these issues you brought up to heart tho and try my best to apply them to my later work. \nfirst off i have to say your art in the begining has edges that are  too soft  imo. id even say in some that you would benefit from lineart.  Some the art has a blurry aspect as if its a dream of some kind. You have a pretty cute style and seems reminiscent of something from a childrens book. hopefully its something you intended. Not sure if you did this yourself but i really like the title yu made for the story on part 4. Panels are a little too easy to follow and seems to be a sort of slideshow format. It would b nice to switch it up some and try a different approach for later issues of you comic.', ""Yeah I know. I wanted to update those pages but I'm already busy as is so I guess I'll leave it that way for now. Also, I'm trying new paneling soon. It gets pretty boring after a while Thanks!

It's a comic where the readers of my story University of Speed1 can ask the characters questions press conference style. So it isn't like the typical Q&A that we see alot in other comics here on tapas. However, in my new comic the U-Speed Revs8 it will be the creators who can ask my characters anything about their comics. And they will answer just like how they did in the press conference...
characters.jpg902x432 166 KB
So will your comics be able to please these characters? just ask them. ^u^

It will be a plus if you read the main story because that way you will learn about them and know how they will react (not a requirement though).
An even bigger plus if i'm already reading you comic(s) since I will have an idea on what my characters will say.
check the press conference comic to see how they answered some of my reader's questions. It can get real crazy or silly depending on the comic they will review.

If you have questions, you can PM me or just comment here. My characters are looking forward to see your comics.

I have never seen a comic improve so much in the first three pages. The lineart is a huge improvement over the flat contour-less shapes you had on page one.

I did catch quite a few grammar and spelling mistakes and I would like to see a little more show and a little less tell for a few of the scenes. You don\'t need to say that food was served in a speech caption when you could just show food being placed on a table in a panel, for example. Last point is just a minor nitpick, but it\'s a little distracting when the text changes sizes with every word balloon. Text should generally stay the same size, as long as the characters are speaking at a normal volume and not whispering or yelling or something. If you have trouble squishing text into a panel, it\'s best to either trim the text, or plan the panel in advance so you know the word balloon will fit.Overall, you have a really interesting concept! I wish you the best of luck, and I really hope my feedback helped!', ""Thanks! I'm not the best at grammar lol. Am a native spanish speaker and only learned english a few years ago.

The characters act as actual people, showing their emotions in different ways, I think you have captured their personality very well with their body language and their expressions. I have to say that I really enjoy your backgrounds, they are not left behind just to fill up the space. The fact that you use lineart on them instead of just painting bubbly shapes shows how much effort put in your work.\nIf I had to say something is that sometimes you color part of your lineart while other times you don’t.

I want to use it for drawing (love to draw people, nature, animals and sometimes abstract), graphic design and editing photos. I do want to have accuracy.

I will read it all later!). Huge improvements in not only the art style but in your composition techniques. The panels and frames just blend together but aren't usually hard to distinguish.\nI really gotta nitpick with this one, but I'd suggest keeping an eye on your typesetting, making sure that some letters don't overlap or connect weirdly with others. It didn't happen too often, but I did notice it from time to time. Also, rarely but still there, and I'm way more guilty of this, but your characters sometimes go a bit off model.

Experiment with foreshortening and placing things int he foreground and background, using shifts in brightness and saturation to imply depth.

Since your story pretty much hasn\'t even begun yet, I\'ll mostly focus on your techniques.\nStarting with repetition can work, but only if it\'s really done well (in my opinion). The first two sentences, while poetic sounding, don\'t make much sense in regards to what follows. Even if they are alluding to something that either has occurred, or will occur, or otherwise, cutting from these seemingly unrelated imagery to the protagonist in a different setting without warning was a bit jarring and confusing. If you really want to implement this, have those first two sentences lead into at least some sort of explanation or context. I like to think that the first thing the audience reads should be gripping, eye-catching - which what you have written certainly is - but it should also make sense.\nAs for the rest of this scene, it has a nice flow, with characters \'characterized\' by their actions as well as words, which is very good. There\'s certainly a level of mystery and intrigue surrounding Indigo, mainly how he turns his freaking secret home invisible!\niwanthtaat.jpg1152x648 11.1 KB\n\nAs for your newest scene, it didn\'t really do much for me, but understandably it is more of an exposition kind of thing. We do learn a bit about the world these characters live in, but only a little. Indigo obviously is being paired with some stranger against his will, it\'s a trope we\'ve seen before...... at least, I\'d say that had I not retroactively read the description of your novel. Knowing that Indigo was born a girl and thus is expected to fulfill a certain role in his society pertaining to that is certainly a very cool topic to play with, and I\'m excited to see where you take this.\nThat being said, the fact that I got this from the description and not the novel itself isn\'t very good. I understand you literally have only two pages out, so you\'ll get to that eventually, but my thought process of ""this is just another one of those stories"" might be what other people see, and they may never read the description. Just something to keep in mind.\nSomething I think you should work on is really taking the readers into the protagonist\'s head. What is he thinking, what is he seeing, what does he think about what he sees? I want to know more about this person and his ideologies!\nBonus Round: Let\'s get some more imagery!

The Moon's Lotus :: Sudden News  | Tapas
I hope you enjoy the introduction! I will try to update regularly but since I still have school, I can't guarantee it. This is my first novel on Tapas and I hope to later make it into a comic. Wish me luck! Next chapter will come soon. Sorry this one...





(I plan on fixing the cover sometime soon...)","['ok first thing i noticed was your cover art. if you do not know how to make a presentable cover get someone to do it. covers are really important for your story, it can drive people away and it says alot about your work as well.', ""Thank you for your feedback! I definitely head what you're saying and it makes sense. I'm used to traditional art and don't have a working tablet to do digital, do you think I could use a new cover through that media or should I try and get one digitally? I have friends who can teach me digital art, so I was wondering if that would be a better way of handling this. Also, thank you for being blunt. I didn't see it from that perspective at first. I'll keep this in mind for future series and work harder at improving my art so I can eventually make my own comics. "", 'digital or traditional is your choice. glad to see your looking forward to changes and i hope your story does very well!', ""I liked the text, but you need to improve your tumbnail. If you want it, send me your pic and I can try to work on the final art here. I can do it next week, cause I'm buying a new tablet."", 'No, thank you for your advice! Have a nice day. ', ""You're an angel!! I'll continue working on my art so I can get better at making covers. Where should I send it?"", 'Salutations!\nOkay I\'ve read through your first post (sorry, I didn\'t have time to read the whole thing, I can totally come back and give more feedback later when I have more time!  )and I\'ve some suggestions for you as per your request!\nTo start: The beginning is the place you hook your reader. It\'s your introduction to your audience and you want to make a good impression. Now, you\'re good at using language with a flow and building a scene. However, there becomes a point where building a scene is too much. In the first paragraph you start us off with the main character sitting alone recalling old memories and comparing the bustle of their old life with their new one. This is a pretty scene, however, this is where we start running into some of our first troubles. To start, you use the word ""Stagnant"" to describe a lakes surface. This might be a nitpick but, stagnant usually describes still water, a lack of movement. Lakes have waves and ebbs to them that don\'t really carry the feeling of stagnant. Now, if this particular lake has something that makes it that way, you\'d best describe that bit first, before calling it stagnant so that the audience understands the scene. (Also, were it stagnant, nobody would want to dip their feet in the water, lol).\nWe also end up on a rambling path here. You have lots of details, but they\'re sort of just thrown out there in random order, I don\'t feel there\'s a logic to them. He\'s traveling memory lane but, when we have a more interesting scene to lead with, it makes little sense to start with a sweeping description of a lake, versus the inciting incident. Since these two things are so close, I\'d say switch them around or combine them. Example:\nSpyro sits at the lake water\'s edge thinking of the last night he saw his father. He can\'t take comfort in the country because the memory is too painful and the scent of tractor fumes takes him back to that city where his father was murdered. This way, you can throw your audience immediately into the action and have them start forming a bond with your protagonist. Otherwise we get long swaths of description before there\'s a solid point for us as readers to grab hold of. Starting with scenery isn\'t terrible, but in this case, you\'ll want to start with a punch and with the falling out between him and his father. You\'ve got all the details, but some rearranging would really help your narrative pack a punch.\nSpeaking of re-arranging and punchy narrative, one of the problems I\'m having here in the beginning is the level of detail the son recalls to himself about the case. He talks about it as if he were a witness and not as if he\'d heard the story second-hand. The level of detail he has for his father (Such as the loud music, the exact threat between the woman and her beau, or the fact that the father\'s/or the friend\'s courting was under expectation, gets really muddy and I\'ve had to read it a couple of time to determine who did what and where.) \nAnother trouble we have is, before all these details of the events of the crime, you claim that the protagonist lost all sense of what transpired. This doesn\'t make sense, as he then goes on to tell us what transpired even though the previous section told us he\'d lost sense of it. This was a very confusing passage and on first read couldn\'t make out if the victim and the assailant were the same person or not. I\'d originally thought that the father was killed by a woman HE was talking to, and the friend happened to be there. I\'d also been unable to tell if it was the father\'s date or not, it\'s really confusing in that part due to the prose. We also move from the cops giving information to a friend of the father\'s telling the story to the kid who is relaying it to us, and this becomes a convoluted game of telephone.\nI think I know where some of the trouble in the narrative is coming from in this regard. Since you\'re speaking in Passive Voice relaying a past event, it\'s easy to \'tell\' rather than \'show\' what happened. In First Person POV this can work, however, in this case the details are drawn out to length and not punchy. I\'ll give you an example to show what I mean:\nOriginal: They told me that there was three gunshot wounds-a result from him trying to save the victim. The said victim had, according to the cops, rushed to my father\'s side to try and save him. Whatever else had transpired was lost on me as I fought back the urge to scream bloody murder and let my sobs take control of my body. The ""victim"" was apparently an old friend of my father\'s and decided to bring me the news. From his perspective he told me that my father was indeed his hero. What transpired according to him was that he had been on a date with a lady he\'d met and they were having a normal evening...that is until his lady friend decided to point a gun at him when he refused to take her to bed.\nEdited: Three gunshot wounds-that\'s what the cops said. It wasn\'t even my father\'s battle; he died for an old friend I\'d never met and all over some rebuked mystery girl who couldn\'t take \'no\' for an answer. The solicitous witch.\nThe same thing was said in the edited paragraph, but it was condensed to cover all points. This is something important to do in editing (and you\'ll totally get there when you get there, editing is a process and it will never be perfect the first time through, so don\'t you worry!) because it strengthens your narrative. Proper word use will help with this. You notice that I noted a bunch of words in bold in the original paragraph? These were words that were frequently repeated within the same paragraph that gums up your narrative. It\'s very noticeable once you know it\'s there and it\'s very distracting and breaks a reader\'s immersion. Now, this is something that almost ALWAYS happens in first drafts. It\'s just the way of it and that\'s totally okay! Now that you know it\'s there, when you get to your editing phase you can find ways to sure up the work.\nAdditionally, you\'ll notice that some of these lines are italicized and in bold. These are words or phrases that can be cut entirely because they do nothing for the narrative. If we were to work on that paragraph alone removing all of those words/sentences in italics it\'d look like this:\nEdited: They told me there were three gunshot wounds-a result from him trying to save the victim. The victim, according to the cops, rushed to my father\'s side to try and save him. Whatever else transpired was lost on me as I fought back the urge to scream bloody murder and let my sobs take control of my body. The ""victim"", apparently an old friend of my father\'s, decided to bring me the news. He had been on a date with a lady and they were having a normal evening... until his lady friend pointed a gun at him when he refused to take her to bed.\nAlso, though you are in First Person you still need to watch your adverbs (-ly words). This, because often there\'s no need for them. For example: ""Apparently he was upset."" Well, he either is or he\'s not, so the sentence would be better suited as ""He was upset"". So in an instance where deleting the -ly word doesn\'t change the sentence, delete it, as it gums up the narrative and slows down your pace. Don\'t worry! I have editing tools to hand out!  Editminion1 is the thing I give to everyone. It helps show you where you\'ve got weak words, adverbs that may not be helpful to your story, homonyms the works! Differences between Active and Passive Voice. And lastly some info about Purple Prose1. These oughta help make editing go smoother!\nAll in all, despite all these things, you\'ve got a lot of strengths here, you\'ve got good descriptive cops, you can build an atmosphere that feels solid (like the smell and tang of a city near in memory but far away, it\'s a really good piece of writing the way you contrast the two). You\'ve also got a great piece of material to start with: guilt over last words said, words never spoken and an upended life. Honestly I think you\'ll take your story far. You just need the average tweaks here and there and that\'s all stuff that was going to happen anyway once you started editing. I wish you the best of luck and when I have more time, I\'ll drop you some more feedback.\nCheers! ', ""Thank you so much for your feedback!!! I knew there was something I could improve on and I appreciate the approach you took to relay this information to me. As for editing, I will try out the software you have suggested since I'm not really liking Gramarly at the moment. I see what you're saying about it feeling too gummy in the narrative and I will actually fix that when I get the moment to do so. As for active and passive voice, I'll admit that it's been a struggle for me. Do you have any advice I can use to strengthen my ability to write with these?(They don't exactly go into further detail in my school, they kind of leave that for middle school ) Thank you again for your feedback, it was extremely eye-opening! I'll fight on\u200b"", ""No problem, glad it's been of help to you! Narratives and editing can be tricky, the important thing is to get your story out on the page and then go back through it with a fine toothed comb.  \nPassive Voice IS a tricky one, because it doesn't hang on adverbs (-ly) alone. There are many things that can throw you into PV and make your audience feel like they're playing telephone with the narrator or POV. Things to look out for: has, been, then, had, while, was, words ending in -ing (on some occasions), adverbs, drive-by descriptions, unneeded words in general, instances of 'the', and overall sentence structure. \nI know that's a lot of stuff! So I'll give you an example in First Person POV:\nPassive Voice: I watched as Jerry was thrown the ball, he then caught it and ran for the line. While he was running I saw some other players from the opposing team quickly catch up to him. He had been running for ages until he finally tripped at the line, only a few inches away.\nActive Voice: I bit my nails when Jerry caught the ball. He sprinted for the line, opposing players close on his heels. Ten feet, five feet, left foot? Jerry tangled his own legs and dropped like a rag-doll, I winced as the others piled on top of him, inches from victory.\nWhen you read the first one, see how the action isn't engaging? How it feels you're being given a laundry list of events? That's what PV does to your narrative and it's a real turn off when your audience can't 'feel' the action. Notice in the second paragraph we're in the action? We're running with Jerry and watching him, we're recoiling as he hits the ground, that's the sort of action you'd want to convey and it can be conveyed in both First Person and Third in such a way that your audience doesn't get left out. \nYeah every school district has its own way of starting those lessons so, alas I can't offer you advice there. However, some advice I can pass along in regards to writing: To be a good writer, you've got to read. When you see how other authors use their adverbs, descriptors, how they craft scenes, you'll get a feel for flow and it'll be easier to make your own in time. "", 'You can send me by email, afisa.wavinflier@yahoo.com', ""I see! I will definitely take your advice and keep these points in mind when writing my future chapters. I was planning to edit the first four chapters today, so with your examples, I think I have a gist of what to watch out for. I appreciate your help, you've been amazing!"", 'Okay, it should be there shortly. Again, thank you for offering to fix my cover. I appreciate it. ', 'Awe, always. Best of luck to you! ', ""You're welcome \nI sent you an email about your picture right now."", 'shorter paragraphs please, it strains my eyes to look at large blobs of text.', ""I'll take that into consideration.

556,Hoping for anyone to give feedbacks on my comic,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello everyone. I discovered Tapas like 2 months ago and just knew that there's a forum in this website (which is a good thing!). I'm still quite new (maybe) in this website and just started to draw comic. I just want to know if my comic lacks of anything/ the story is uninteresting/ does it pique your interest to read it. Welp, although the comic has 4 chapters now, I still need some feed backs as no one commented on the chapters 
Here's the link of my comic : https://tapas.io/series/Triangle33","['YOur colors are very bright and fun and the pacing seems pretty good. Its not my kind of genre but i think its a good start. One minor thing i would suggest is to make the bubbles more opaque as it can be a little hard to read the text sometimes.\nkeep up the good work!', 'waaah!! a fellow creator!\nOkay! Before I say anything, I\'ll just remind you that all of these are opinions from a very amateur comic artist lol. I hope you don\'t see them as something offensive.\nSo I\'ve read all of the chapters. Let\'s start with the genre, love triangles are not particularly my cup of tea but there are some exceptions. When I first saw your comic I wasn\'t really ""hooked"" with it. For my case, it was because of the illustration itself. It felt like the colours were all over the place which is why it seemed a little bland(not that I\'m saying that your colours were lacking of colour, in fact there were a lot of \'em, maybe too much). The colours were a little too saturated.\nAs for the flow of the story, I don\'t have much of a problem with it. I\'ve read a lot of manga (I still do ), and I think some were laid out nicely, some were not. I wish I could sympathize with Emi when she moved out...but everything felt a little fast-paced, giving me no time to feel for her emotions. I think a lot of your scenes were fast paced, reading them were a breeze.\nOVERALL, I have no problems with it. Your art is already amazing, and I think your story could come out nicely. I could definitely tell that you spent time on the backgrounds (I applaud you for that )  The story was really funny and it gave me a genuine laugh out loud. Your comic(or manga) reminded me of my 12-year old days, back when I was addicted to anime and anything related to it. It was nostalgia for me, and I thank you for that.\n I think, a planned colour scheme will help you with your colour values. And maybe try to give more spaces in-between the panels, so that it won\'t look like there\'s too much going on. OH AND THE SPEECH BUBBLES TOO! maybe increase the opacity a lil\'\nSO YEAH. those are my suggestions and opinions. I really hope that I didn\'t sound too offensive. As a fellow comic-artist I know how hard it is to create even a single page. \n Anyywaaaay, you just earned a subscriber! I look forward into reading you comic more~~~\nBest of wishes!', ""That's a really cute webcomic tbh I love the cheery colors and the cute looking characters.keep it up "", 'Your colors seem nice and I could see your line work improving from chapter to chapter. I did get a bit lost on how fast everything was happening, maybe slow it a bit for a more build up for moments. Otherwise great work on it, love triangles can be tricky to do story wise.\nOne thing is I am not sure the font you use goes well with the story, not saying to pick a serious like font either since this is indeed a comedy/romance from the looks of it, but I feel a different font would work better.', ""The majority of the panels in the comic are headshots or bust-ups. I'd suggest using more variations instead: half body shots, full body shots, close-ups of other body parts (e.g. a clenched fist to show anger, awkwardly-posed feet to show nervousness, etc), establishing shots...\nI really liked that one panel of her flopping on her bed, because not only was it a full body shot, it also showed the background (with which she was interacting with) AND was a bird's eye view. I think it would improve the comic if you make more like that. Interacting with the surroundings can say a lot about the character's mood!"", 'Thank you for subscribing! And ahaha I\'m not going to be offended as your feedbacks are really helpful! \nI\'m more of a noob with colours so I really want to improve my ""coloring"" skills more (as I hate coloring since kindergarten haha)\nSince this is my first time writing the story on my own, it really lacks on how it should be paced. My friend used to write the whole plot then discussed it with me how it should flow but since she\'s busy with college, I don\'t want to be a disturbance. I will try to improve the flow of the story.\nThank you for giving me a really good feedback!', 'Thank you for your feedback!', ""Yes, I do get a lot of comments here about how fast-paced it is. I'm really sorry if you got lost with how suddenly the story goes. I will try to consult with my friend (who's a really great writer) and review back the story. And I will consider changing the font.\nThank you for your nice feedback!"", 'Thank you for bringing that up! Now I realize why everytime when I read back the comic pages, they look like missing something and feels kinda bland. I will try to draw various perspectives in the panels of my comic to make it looks more interesting!\nA big thank you for that important tips!']",4/9/2018 23:03,https://forums.tapas.io/t/hoping-for-anyone-to-give-feedbacks-on-my-comic/24067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

by @DiegoPalacios this here, I personally had a blast reading Rocky, giving it the badge O scream since I really enjoy the humor.it borders on being so absurd and being funny while doing it, Rocky Satires shonen and other tropes as well as subverting it.I recommend this comic for those who wanna know the art of subversion, Diego doesn't just say ""hey, she's a tsundere"", he goes a step further than that.as of this moment, some characters seem to kinda be ""stuck"" when it comes to character development, which makes a character (who constantly loose in a state of looped misery) kinda get old. which may come in handy for subversion.not to say Rocky is stale, rocky is anything but stale, he is a rock7/10

The Chosen One | Tapas
A silly comic about an 80-year-old grandma on an epic adventure as the Chosen One.





suggested by @Kann annnndI like it, there's a charm to the unnamed chosen one protagonist, the beginning threw me off, but it makes sense right afterthe comic is pretty fast-paced, and some of the best gags I found in this comic is how the most absurd things are given the most basic explanation that can't even be questioned. (""Nani? how is he able to extinguish my fire moves so easy?"" said Bob, then willy says ""because he's using a bucket of water"")though on the other hand, I do have some gripes with the comic, the anatomy sometimes throws me off (if the anatomy is bad on purpose, the good for you I guess), the facial expressions are pretty expressive, though me personally, I feel like they kinda come up with the wacky expressions too much, so it kinda loses a bit of ""punch"" when it really does matter (page 12), also the format is kinda... weird? pages aren't as long per episode when you can easily just merge them into one episode without the comments breaking up the pages for a smoother reading experience (comic is fast paced, but that's kinda ruined by how some individual pages consisting of 3 panels have a comment section gap)asides from my long as hell talking thingy, I give The Chosen One a...5/10the chosen one does some things good, but it also has a few that also hold it back. still worth a read (I wish the comic was in color, but that's personally me)

Meet maria, our heroine! An average girl lost on a fantastic land. Now, she needs to win a magical tournament to find her way home. she will have to ally herself and fight with many weird and colorful...





comic from @Gen_Atto (from the Im a moron made a type and people are expecting reviews now so ye)I've read the first two ""Episodes"" (MPB 1 and 2) which are organized to be entire chapters (which can be a slight inconvenience when I decide to take a break for a bit mid chapter, and I actually have to go on the episode and look for where I left off), generally 2-4 pages per episode makes the process easierOTHERWISE, enough ranting regarding comic formatthe Magic Power Ball, I'll say its not too bad, I can't give it the OK for new people because there's simply quite a bit to readfor a comedy, it relies quite a bit on the anime moe facial expressions, rather than punchlines, and maybe a few gags, though for someone like me, it's very hard to get me to laugh at slapstick, so I didn't laugh too much.HOWEVER, there was one moment in chapter 1 that really did make me laugh, it's a scene which gives the explanation of how the main character actually got into the whole mess, that in combination of some dramatic irony made the scene unfold just one big hilarious treat to read (you know what I'm talking about Gen, for those who arent Gen, read the first chapter, I physically can't explain the joke, its definitely worth it) that's what makes the joke funny, you put two and two together, then the Hijinx becomes funny.otherwise! time to get into my gripes (note that I'm very sure that Gen has probably adressed the issues I am mentioning, if he hasn't... then he should get going on it)I can't give it the Paintbrush because of two things, which sound pretty minor, but becomes a problem since it holds back on character expression :U ""I'm scared :U""""Oh hello :U"" ""I will destroy you :U""basically, the face expressions are kinda stiff or samey, which is kind of a problem when the character's face is really close to the camera and they're supposed to give the expression of terror (the opposite problem of ""the Chosen one"")there are some questionable anatomy in the comic, though that does seem to improve as I read on, just the facial expressions seem a bit sameyalso, there's some style inconsistency (Character A looks anime, character B looks western and more realistic in terms of Artstyle, but who knows, maybe its a stylistic choice, 80% of the characters looked anime)overall, I give MPB a5.1/10 I enjoyed it more than the average

this comic WILL get lost and Forgotten if it doesn't get its shiz together and stop padding or making the pace of the comic so dahm slow.its first few pages were pretty engaging, I actually liked the comic at that point, and I honestly don't mind the once a week update. I was pretty invested from the get go.that was untill...  episodes 1/4 through 1/9you know what those pages are? FILLERjust FILLER, and it's not even plot related or plot at all, I'm not talking Naruto sidetracked story arch kinda filler, all of these pages are frigging just character sheets.and the best part is this only updated once a weekI was bombarded with a month's and a week worth of character sheets instead of the actual dahm comic, this doesn't help where immediately after, it becomes characters talking and it's not even talking as in to set up the plot, its literally the type of talking where it feels like its going nowhere except flesh out the characters when you can just instead.*Introduce maybe 1-2 characters, Start the plot, then as the plot goes on, introduce the other characters, and then flesh them out as you move the plot forward, instead of spending 20 or so pages of just fleshing out the charactersheck, there are 4 pages dedicated to a conversation regarding a character's cake they're eatingLuna, if your reading this, condense those dahm character sheets into one episode, or remove them all together, and if you're going to make readers wait a week for a dahm page, don't give people a filler page (like 4 panels of a guy getting up) because it's actually a waste of time.4.5/10-.5 because the filler negativity impacts the comic fromeven being average

The Dummy's Dummy | Tapas
A PG-rated horror webcomic about a psychic girl named Yumi, an eerie living puppet named Paris, and the strange and often deadly monsters they face off against. Ghosts, ghouls, and... possessed teddy bears? Oh, my!





The Dummy's dummythis comic is really thrilling, I've never seen a comic that seriously took my breath away!the Dummy's Dummy can get sincerely scary, not in a gruesome and very violent way full of gore (its PG 13), maybe some body-horror, but that's about it. this comic doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares and a ton of blood.its horror gets into your head with actual scary ideas, it gets you attached to characters, and when you least expect it... BOOM... you're grasping for the next page.its especially good seeing for how slick and fast pace the majority of the comic is.don't worry about needing to catch up unless the comic is like 500 pages or something.as of this moment, I have not seen a comic to top this one, so...8/10 (a blast to read)

I've read this comic, but I havent been keeping up with it lately, mainly because Sci fi isnt my thing, though honestly, I should be ashamed for putting it on hold :Y Red Hunt is the only Sci-Fi comic I actually spent a considerable amount of time reading at one point, it only has 50 ish subsbut...boy... this comic deserves a bit more than that...its art style is rather unexplainable to be honest, I just like it, and for a science comic, I didn't expect some interesting ideas to pop up, there's so much more to the protagonist than what is seen, though...one of my problems was mainly my ability to wrap my head around what is going on and certain concepts, maybe its just me, and I'm more fantasy.otherwise, this comic is underrated, and it seriously deserves more attention than what it has, can we get... 70 subs?6.5/10

The Guard | Tapas
A group of teens come together, to battle ancient, and mythical monsters, as a superhero force known, as The Guard.





","['Salutations! \nAs per your request, I took a look at your manuscript and have some feedback for you!\nFirst: I like that you started in the middle of the action between Doctor Eisner and his team. Their back and forth seemed pretty natural, albeit I felt that the person he was talking to should\'ve been named rather than ""The excavation team"". If that person was an assistant, it would make more sense for him to be right at Eisner\'s side when the big moment happens. To that end, I believe a little more description is in order. \nI don\'t get a sense of the terror because we get a single throw away line of ""The entire excavation crew screamed in horror, \'till suddenly silence."" This does not engage me and I don\'t feel the creeping sense of urgency or gravity. I will also note: In your narrative I\'d avoid words like ""\'til"" and just use the full ""until"" since you\'re not writing in first person. There\'s no need for the narrative outside of speech to take on a vocal identity like those of first person. I\'d reserve shortened words to speech only so that, when they are used, they don\'t drop a reader out of the flow.\nSpeaking of flow, we\'ve hit another problem. The next scene that starts with Amore happens without a break or anything indicating that the scene has changed. We\'re in the tomb and suddenly we\'re following a teenager in the very next paragraph. We also run into an issue here:\n""Our story takes place in Moss City an average boring town, and like most stories it\'ll become the epicenter of the incredible. Now let\'s meet our main characters,"" \nYou didn\'t establish a narrator from the very beginning, so introducing one suddenly is jarring and immediately took me out of your story and I dropped my suspension of disbelief. This happens right in the beginning of your story. Get rid of this bit entirely as it has no narrative value to have us in a story, to take us out and explain we\'ll be meeting main characters, only to put us back in the story so we can meet the main characters. It wrecks your writing flow and is detrimental to the story itself. Anything that sounds like it\'s being said by a narrator needs to be cut so you don\'t break voice.\nAnother trouble I\'ve run into is the use of -s verses -ed. You\'re using both and it\'s jarring to read. Ending words with -s (example: She searches for an answer Vs. She searched for an answer) can harm your narrative. It throws you right into Passive Voice. Passive Voice happens when you\'re being told a story, rather than being shown. I\'ll use an example from your own text to illustrate my point:\nOriginal: Amore wakes up with a smile on her face. Excited for what the day will bring. She hopped out of bed frantically grabbing clothes and rushed into the bathroom to get ready. She emerges from her bathroom, grabs her bag, and runs downstairs. And sees her parents eating breakfast.""\nEdited: ""Amore woke with a smile, excited for the day. She hopped out of bed and grabbed up her clothes as she rushed into the bathroom. Minutes later she emerged, bag in hand as she headed downstairs where her parents ate breakfast.""\nIn your original piece, I put in bold every time you switched your -ed and your -s. It\'s very noticeable and it can cause a reader to stop. Now, you are by no means the only person who does this, it happens because we tend to switch these things around when we have vocal conversations, so often that can translate into writing. Editing fixes this! So don\'t worry, when you get to your major editing stage (now that you know it\'s there) you can fix it.\nGoing back to my point about Passive Voice. In your original paragraph we\'re given a list of things that happened in a sequence, but we\'re being told that list when the -s is used in place of -ed. When using -ed at the end of words, the action is with the main character and the reader. When using -s the action tends to just be the narrator and whatever list or detail they\'re willing to share. It\'s hard, but in third person it is best to use -ed in place of -s so that the reader doesn\'t feel like they\'re just being told details in rapid succession, rather than being able to see, smell, and touch the scene you wish to make. (Words ending in -ly also throw you into passive voice. Often they are unneeded so, if a word ending in -ly can be replaced by a word ending in -ed, even if you have to restructure the sentence, delete it.)\nTo that end, we\'ve run into another hiccup: dialogue and formatting. Now, I know that formatting can be awkward with how certain devices upload. If you\'re uploading from a phone or a mobile device it\'s understandable if you have trouble with format. What has happened here is that, the dialogue portions of your manuscript have been parsed out way too far apart. So instead of getting paragraphs, we get one line of dialogue at a time and it\'s very distracting when I\'m trying to get into the story itself. I\'d just double check your formatting and see if there is a way you might tighten it up so that the format itself doesn\'t distract your readers from enjoying your work. Sadly, aesthetics play a much bigger role in keeping readers focused than we\'d like to think. It\'s just one of those things, when you don\'t notice the format, it\'s perfect but when you do notice, it\'s distracting. Don\'t worry! This too is something easily solvable in the editing process once you know it\'s there!\nNow, in regards to the long string of dialogue, it\'s just that. I don\'t feel like I\'ve entered any of these characters lives. I\'m with Amore at first for breakfast only to end up with Dillon for a few seconds, to hear his mother complain to him that he\'s not missing more school, only to be thrust back into Amore in the car with her mother. To be honest, this seems more to me like an outline of dialogue written for a comic, rather than a novel. I don\'t get any time to absorb information about the characters before I\'m in another scene. Now, that\'s not to say you have to be over-descriptive in every scene, but some description would be nice so I can start imagining people. Case in point: You describe Amore as literally ""A black girl"" and Dillon literally as ""A white boy"". Outside of their skin tones, I have no idea what these two people look like.\nDoes Amore have tight curls? Is her hair straightened and meticulously kept? Does she wear braids? Does she have hazel eyes or brown eyes? Do her cheeks dimple when she smiles? Does she have freckles? You don\'t have to go overboard with it but, I need to know something about these people you want me to spend a story with. To imagine them will help me empathize with them and get behind their viewpoint. I\'m going to give you some resources here to help you with constructing a scene, constructing a character, proper tenses, Passive Voice, Description, and my favorite: Edit Minion. Note: Each item separated by a comma has its own unique link so, you\'ll have to click on each one.\nAll in all, this piece is very much a first draft and that\'s okay! Everybody starts somewhere and sometimes you just have to get your ideas out there on the page, so you can come back and retool things later. There is a lot of work to be done here on the technical side of things and that\'s just how it all works anyway so, you\'re right on track. In regards to your story, I\'m all about super heroes. I think they\'re charming and can be very uplifting. You\'ve got an exciting story in there, you just have to polish and shine a little bit so that we can see your work at its best. I hope my feedback helps you as you edit you work and I wish you all the best with your story.\nI\'m sure you\'ll make something great.

561,Tumblr promo posts for LGBTQ webcomics,Reviews | Feedback,[],"First of all I want to make clear that these are promotional posts rather than reviews, but this was the most fitting forum for the topic. They will be posted to the tumblr blog lgbtwebcomics96, which I run.
They’re basically like this57 and this26 and this21. I think these kinds of posts look good aesthetically and tend to catch attention better than simpler ones, but I don’t feel it’s appropriate for me to post whole pages from someone’s comic without their permission.
For the posts, I choose a handful of comic pages (or sometimes only one or two) that I think will best entice readers to click through and read the rest of the comic. I include the comic’s summary, links to where the comic can be read, and links to places people can buy merch or support through Patreon where applicable.
I can usually find everything I need on my own so all you need to do is give me permission if you like, but I’m also happy to take input from you if you want anything different or specific in your post (or for you to make the post yourself and send it in).
Leave a reply to this post if you’d like to give me permission to use sample pages from your LGBTQ webcomic to make a promotional post about it.

A critical review I got that inspired me to rewrite the begenning was that it was very confusing. Now, what I seek is the expertise from people that have read quite a few comics or have created their own.
Thank you~~~!","[""I think what's going to help you out a lot, especially when you start doing sketch works near around Chapter 05 or so is to add a  bit of contrast to it. By that I mean add some black to it. Add some gray or tones and liven it up a bit. I can tell from reading the first pages of the first episode that your artwork in itself has improved. Not without a few hiccups but definitely far better.\nHowever the style you use until the current page, the sketch like quality, doesn't lead for much contrast. What you have is essentially the basic outline of your series and that's just not as eye catching. If a character's hair is dark, shade it in completely black or give it some kind of tone. The same with their clothes. It'll not only look better but also cleaner and you can do the same thing with the background as well.\nDo that and your pages will begin to look more appealing and catch the reader's eyes."", ""I agree with @ReroOnyx about using black for the outlines. It would not only make it look more finished, but also give definition to the pictures.\nOn another note, your comic could use shadow to make it more dimensional. Even though I like the manga-esque art style, the comic would look cleaner and neater if you don't overlap the outlines as much. Just draw it in one stroke.\nUntitled.png1020x1012 104 KB\n\nAlso, it's rather difficult to follow the story since all the panels are cramped so closely together. Increase the spacing between panels, especially when the camera moves from one place to another. For example:\n\nUntitled.png2208x1192 404 KB\nThe right one is my enhanced version of it.\nI can't say much plot wise, but at a glance, your characters have a wide variety of personalities and demeanour, which is a pretty difficult thing to accomplish, seeing as how big the number of characters are. Something that confused me, though, is why the tan man in white outfit (Chapter 5 Part 1) sought help from the two girls when just a few moments ago they were fighting each other.\nExtra tip: Mark your episodes with Chapter (Number) Part (Number) or (Chapter Name) Part (Number) accordingly, as to not confuse your readers.E.g.

For example, panel 2, bubble is touching and cutting the words ''Now'' and ''money''. There's a lot of space below, why not make the bubble a little bigger or, better yet, divide the dialogue in lines? That way you even make space to not cut panel 1's bubble. Panels 3 and 4 also have their bubble touching the line, and at least to me it would be cleaner if we had a little bit of space. To finish, bubble's lines, specially last panel's, are kind of rough, was that intentional?

568,Reviewing your most recent/favorite cover!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Whenever I'm designing a cover I always try to make sure that 1. It relates heavily to the overall story but also sets the mood for the chapter it belongs to. Also 2. Is it compelling enough to for someone to want to continue reading from that point?
I worked really hard on this one. I know it's simple but I put a lot of thought into it, and I guess what I'm asking (especially since I've yet to post pg1 as of yet) is would you see this on the internet (or maybe even a book shelf >>) and feel interested in what it's all about? Maybe offer me some feedback and post your favorite/most recent cover and share a little about your own cover making process.

Also if you'd like to check my comic out you can find it at: https://tapas.io/series/Ghosting21","[""I like your decision to cut off the bottom of the planet, I find the image more interesting that way.\nThe one thing I'd suggest is making the title a little larger. There's so much white space between it and the illustration, and since the eye is drawn to the illustration it is a bit of a chore to look up at the title. It wouldn't take much, even just bolding it and lowering it a little would do the trick."", ""^^ I think maybe you're not viewing the full image because the earth doesn't cut off, but as far as making the font larger I have received that comment before and now's probably the time to accept that smaller text was a bad idea lol. I thought it looked elegant in a way but making it bigger and closer to the subject of the image would probably be more pleasing to the eyes. Thank you for the feedback!"", ""Oh, oops. I didn't click on the image and was just looking at the what was showing on the thread (I didn't even see the character with pink hair).\nNow that I'm looking at the full thing, I'm wondering about your image dimensions (it looks rather tall). Have you considered bringing the title to the bottom? Having it across their legs would might be something to think about."", ""I'm always weary about putting text over my drawings because after I'm done with the whole thing I'm too nervous to cover it with anything. I just need to come to terms with the cover being a mix of text and art that should come together rather than stand on their own. Need to find that perfect harmony. I'll be using diverse title placement in the future for sure, maybe I'm too traditional about some things."", ""I like this cover. It made me grin, what with the tall ghost and his tiny sheet, with the short ghost and her long one. I dunno, little gags like that make me smile so good on you there. The only thing I would suggest is not to use lens flare. It just doesn't feel right, somehow? In a lot of 2D works a lens flare that isn't also illustrated feels like it's not part of the piece somehow. Granted, I know it's supposed to be a glint of the sun from behind the planet but, I dunno you might try to draw one and see if it suits the style better? Outside of that the art is great, I love how you used colors here and kept it simple but expressive. It's a good cover. \nI try to do similarly with my own covers. I try to think of encapsulating the point with color or with the style of that cover to set the expectation for the audience or, hell, surprise them. Of all the covers I've made, I know it might seem cheesy but my main cover is the one I like the most for this:\n\nNew Cover.jpg720x840 172 KB\n\nI dunno, maybe it's because it covers the whole comic but, it's the one I feel I had the most fun with overall."", ""Ohhhh goodness I tried to draw that shine myself   it looked like a smudge, I decided using the filter was the lesser of two evils in this case. I'm hoping throughout this comic I will have to rely less and less on effects and filters. I agree that most of the time an added effect on top of 2d art looks off putting. Thank you! I really tried with the art so it's nice to see you say it's great ^^\nI spent a lot of time looking at your cover, it's got a lot going on in a good way! I admit it interested me enough to check your comic out (it looks fantastic btw, I'm only a handful of pages in but I can see the effort you put into these pages. Dialogue, style, colors and all.)"", ""I think your cover is cute! Especially the ghost. Also the shine on the planet is pretty cool!\nThis is the cover for chapter 5 of Friends or Lovers?.

Shines are their own little world of misery, that's quite certain. I'm sure you'll figure out the method you want to use that'd work best for you. At least you gave it a good go first! Besides, I can't wait until your pages post, I love the style you're working in so, I'm intrigued. \nAw thank you! I am glad that you like what you've found there. (I always turn into a head case when mapping out scenes. Can't help it, I guess) It certainly has been a labor of love (as all comics are for all creators, lol)."", ""For me, I think that your cover is pretty cute, haha. It gives some sort of light feel to the comic that you're about to provide. (Loove the ray of light at the upper corner of the planet) Plus, the vibe that I get from the picture is curiosity. Why a planet? Why the ghost disguise? Things like that. ^^ So I just want to say that you did a great job! You can only improve from here on. <3\nMy favourite cover (so far, since I've only recently published my comic) is this:\n\nmerged100.png1000x1497 949 KB\n\nDidn't put a title yet though. I'm not sure where to place it. XD"", '@halstonsch I love the colours on that moon. They\'re very chilled out. I think it could be a bit more stylistic in it\'s look because with a white backdrop and a large graphic like that there\'s a lot more room to experiment and amp up the vibe. I think that maybe the colouring could be a bit more ambitious? I dunno. I feel that limiting the colour palette makes something more eye catching but you\'ve got both bright and muted shades in this one.However, what you\'ve got is executed very well. Props to you. I\'m just purposely looking for ways it could improve.\n@SynCypher\nI like the illustration a lot. You\'ve clearly put the time and effort into laying it out well. I do think you could execute the lighting a little better though - at the moment you\'ve just added a black gradient but there are more exciting ways to get a deep light-to-dark contrast. You could try using overlay and multiply layers with colours to experiment with that. I think using the greens and purples you\'re already using would give interesting looks.The Design is also a little off. You can generate way more visual intrigue by trimming it down. Right now a lot of space is taken up by blank space in the background, so a little cropping would help. The text colour could also be changed to something more fitting to the scene.I really like the two characters\' look though. It\'s very intense in its premise. The glowing elements in the darker area are pretty intriguing.\nThe cover for my current chapter has an ""80s comics"" graphic design style, since it\'s set in the 80s. Plenty of old-school cheesiness.\ncover - outsiders tapastic.png752x1083 910 KB\n', ""I'm not 100% satisfied with this cover and I'll probably redo it again but here's the cover for my comic.\ncover.png940x1254 379 KB\n"", ""Thanks for the feedback! It'll be great help.  Yeah lighting is always something that's on my mind. Sadly what I can do with paint I'm not quite up to snuff with digital. I'm still learning how to make layers do what I want them to (I've had a tug of war for color richness that I don't think I'm winning yet). Still, this only cements that I can do more and should to sure up the work. I'm guilty of dark detail eating backgrounds (and not cropping as often as I probably could). It's something I'll really have to work at with my covers. Light and color play with be the fun parts, haha.\nOkay I love 80's cheese. Hell, I'm re-watching the first 78 episodes of The Real Ghostbusters just because I enjoy it so much. I love the poses you have going on here, it immediately introduces us to the characters personalities. Your comic looks like a lark, if you ask me."", ""I'm intrigued because the girl isn't wearing shoes, but the ghost it.\nI made this cover a few days ago. First time I made my own."", ""I like the simple but stylish font you chose here, and the entirely white background. It really makes it pop. I noticed through the link to your comic there is a second version of the cover, however, (one that is actually in use) and I feel that one is a bit more balanced for having the title larger and lower.\nI get the impression from the design that the story takes place in a different world-- one that's all white? If so, that's cool to me because I have a similar concept! My cover is also similar to yours in layout and style, though it's flipped with the characters being at the top. Overall, I'm partial to this style of cover so you've got a thumbs up from me."", ""@halstonsch I really like your cover. I agree with others that the title could be bigger, and the space between the title and image could be condensed. I also really like that the background is white. It's effective. I would also include your name as a creator somewhere as well. I think the dimensions of the cover appear a bit strange, as it feels very long.

569,"Hey bruh, lets share your protagonist (from your comic)",Reviews | Feedback,[],"I'll share mines here, though share me yours :U 
an image, maybe an excerpt of them doing stuff...
maybe a link to their comic if its gucci 
I don't wanna be the only one who's gonna be reviewing your characters, so be free to drop feedback regarding another's protagonist :U 
this ain't just some narcissist post for everyone, the purpose here is to give feedback regarding character first impressions, also because I wanna see what does and doesn't make a protagonist :U
what to post here?- an image (is possible)- one quote from them. (philosophical, funny, whatever, all that matters is people get the gist of them)- le name atm established in the first chapter- some summary- an excerpt of their personality (using only details in the comic/novel presented, so if your character is like gay or something, but they haven't actually outright presented it in the novel/comic, not worth mentioning, otherwise, try sticking with the first chapter. if there isn't enough content in the first chapter, say what you intend their personality to be established in the first chapter)- Role/context in the story (basically, who are they? asides from the fact they are a protagonist, who are they in the eyes of their world? a nobody? a joke? a hero?)- Motivation/end goal (what do they want and how do they plan to get it?)- describe a scenario, and have them do something in-character- your comic/novel they exist in :u, assuming you manage to actually get people interested
and when you're reviewing a character (which I heavily endorse), use whatever format you use to review or something, but try to be detailed, point out any concerns if possible

""please don't tell me, just don't die""""skip, please skip""-The dark one/chaos ruler/the great evil/Strife
I'll stick with strife since it's super swift to say, tldr, Strife is the dark one, the great evil said to be the big bad of the world who will destroy the world. despite the hefty title and role in the world, Strife is indifferent, or rather repellent of their own role. like, who would actually want to be the most hated and feared person in the literal world? due to being the ""dark lord"", Strife's fate is sealed and is practically ""doomed"" to an inevitable fate by the hands of the chosen one.that is the one rule, Strife WILL die to the chosen one, she WILL be eradicated and she WILL become the dark one she is meant to be. there is absolutely NOTHING she can do to stop that, her fate is INEVITABLE.
due to this, strife is basically an absurdist, otherwise, she is shown to speak very few words at a time, preferring telepathy to dump her thoughts onto people. an ""action rather than words"" per deal. completely not giving a Dahm what ideology and belief people have to say, and just moving along with her agenda, due to some ""hinted"" details in the comic (in the prologue), Strife is shown to ""conveniently"" be prepared for situations and encounters. she otherwise has a weird shape-shifting companion by her side.
Strife is a character who has to deal with the themes of ""what's it like to be the dark lord in a world with a chosen one prophecy"", the result, due to the fact that literally, everything you do means anything because your future's already been established, Strife decides to do everything in her power to not be the monster she is prophecized to be. a character who delves into themes of existentialism and depression per say. (because Strife is edgy, even though in a logical sense, its kinda justified since ya know, you have no control of who you are)
overall, she is motivated to ""not die"" and she does have people she is willing to protect. since nothing, she does really matter in the grand scheme of things, except probably not ending the world if she dies, Strife tries to make the chosen one waste his time looking for her in a wild goose chase, while she does more important tasks, like finding a place to sleep, paying rent, grocery shopping, dealing with inquisitors that want to kill her and burn her at the steak, deciding on what socks to wear, and dealing with dark entities that are trying to erraticate the town's people again
normal Dark lord stuff
In a dark room, strife and her eldritch companion stand side by side in the back, while her friend, an ifrit is negotiating with a warmongering orc in reguards of protection and a place to sleep, the orc takes notice of the hooded figure, before asking herorc: tell me, who are you?Strife, appearing mysterious as she fiddles with a crystal, scratching on its surface is immediately surprised with the orc suddenly talking to her, she was not paying attention to the conversation, so she is completely clueless on what to say, she looks to her eldritch companion, before looking at the orc, she quietly mumblesStrife: h-huh?orc: your cloak, and friend, you don't look normal... who are you?Strife: s-some... spellc-aster?orc: what kind of spellcaster?Strife: uses telepathy chaos magic. she tries to deliver it in an intimidating tone to sound cool, since chaos magic is pretty feared, and orcs like people who are fearedorc: shock, his face turns pale, even orcs are afraid of chaos magic, a magic wielded by the dark one themselvesStrife: w-will you still let us have a place to s-sleep? finishes the rest of her sentence through telepathy in your encampment of course, we'll still pay rent...

He has a crazy cool hairstyle and a nicely subdued colour palette.  And your quick backstory on him grabs me right off.  To match his rebel looks, he\'s a hitman with roots in an anarchist location.  This kind of big personality shows!  The smaller details as we go reflect a great deal of his character and what his role is in the story.\nYou did a brilliant job fleshing his badassery out with the impulsive nature that seems to cultivate his dealings.  Establishing the sociopolitical sphere of his experiences should flesh out the remainder of his identity.

He\'s racist towards aliens for personal reasons and seeing as how he works with an extremely annoying alien, things get a little chaotic. However, Isaac is merciful when it comes to the innocent which is why he hasn\'t flat out abandoned Henri and his lost cause.Scenario: If Frank walked up to sleeping Isaac in the middle of the night and said, ""Isaac, I can\'t sleep,"" Isaac would punch him so hard he\'d go unconscious.

Just recently realizing the cruelty in war and man\'s decision to continue the concept, Frank aspired to be more like Henri since the kid still has his innocence and morals intact. Frank has three goals: make a big book of every recipe on Earth, collect all kinds of music from the planet, and make the world\'s best pizza Isaac claims to have the recipe for.Scenario: Frank once found two pictures.

Both were punished in hell as demons (devils are wardens, demons are punished souls,) together tied by frost and fire since they clash and fight, and because of the nature of their crime, incubus hunger.Summary: In the comic, 200 years in the future from the RP, he\'s long established as an assassin in a mob, run by his twin children, Azren and Cordia. They have a really low moral compass, but Jester\'s has always been more prominent. It\'s not perfect, he\'s not a good guy, but is more prone to doing acts of good than most others.

She doesn’t want to change her body much because she was raised in a community of bigger women, including her adoptive mother.  She felt inspired by their motherly nature at a young age, so she wanted to be like them.Another flaws of her character is that she has little knowledge of other culture, as she was homeschooled in a Christian environment (homeschooled myself).  Her intended act of kind gesture may accidentally appear to be an insult to another.  She will also face lesbian characters, which would shock her (and honestly, that would be fun to write).She is also very attached to her Mexican family, which would bring up an interesting arc.And now, finally, power flaws.  Unlike Superman, who learn of his powers, Jill never knew what she was capable of, until the end of the series (where she meet the characters of her past).She is not virtually bulletproof, though she has a rather good reaction time.In some case, she lacks control, as she tends to have a “shoot first, think later” type of mindset.

Can you review this page[link or upload your page directly]
Thank you""
And I will reply with a short note on your page that I hope will prove useful to you as you continue making your comic. It's not meant to be a comprehensive review, but I might catch something fundamental you are missing or a neat trick you can use to make the comic more readable.
I am not an art critique, I'm not going to tell you to draw better.

It\'s also hard to establish context for the actions that are depicted on the page, cause again first person perspective. It would take the perspective of someone with higher knowledge and authority to establish that context, but that might make the protagonist less compelling...hence a framing device.\nA prologue that establishes the fantasy expectations of the world (a prophecy, a warning, ominous conversation) while cliche, establishes the stakes.\nUnless you can rewrite the first chapter to establish stakes greater than what is readily apparent (the need to find a cook), I suggest you add some kind of framing device.\n', ""That's on me.

That totally weird premise that makes you watch it in the first place.\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org1\n\n\n\nHigh-concept\nHigh-concept is a type of artistic work that can be easily pitched with a succinctly stated premise. It can be contrasted with low-concept, which is more concerned with character development and other subtleties that are not as easily summarized. The origin of the term is disputed.   High-concept narratives are typically characterised by an overarching ""what if?"" scenario that acts as a catalyst for the following events. Often, the most popular summer blockbuster movies are built on a high-concep...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe high-concept becomes extremely important when you are doing a genre work (fantasy, sci-fi, etc), cause that is the reason people read such genre works in the first place, sacrificing literary potential and realism for the potential of high thrills.\nHigh concepts allow audience attention is carried by curiosity of how that high concept is carried out, more often than not it\'s dissappointment but at least the audience is carried through the work.\nYou don\'t have that (yet) in Paladins.', 'Well, maybe not in the first chapter. \nI did think ""Cthuluesque paladin"" was sufficiently high-concept, and that a jaded and obviously battle-scarred warrior starting to care about people again was enough of an emotional hook.', 'Noo!

Because the art is so large it requires giant scrolls to orient each panel, and that doesn\'t work for gag panels.\nThe gag comic works best when you can quickly dart back to the beginning after you see the punchline. This requires me to scroll up to make sure if I missed anything because the gag is purely visual. At the very least with gag comics with language use, your mind is trained to remember what was said between the characters.\nA purely visual gag needs all of the gag to be plainly there on one visible plane to be fully appreciated.\nTry to rearrange it so it doesn\'t need too much scrolling, or hell just tries and fit the gag into standard pages.

While this kind of structure is serviceable, it might be worth exploring for future chapters on how to more integrate the narrative to the action.\nWhich is something that tends to come up with these types of western written manga style comics (which Cloverlines is also going to have to face)\nBecause we're used to more shall we say verbal writing in western comics, it tends to be when we're working in a more manga form factor (lesser panels, more action, more expressive) we tend to seperate the talky bits and the action bits.\nFor example we (as western writers writing manga form factor) cant do this:\n\n\n3\nThat just ludicrous!\nWhere as manga is usually written like this:\n\n\n1\nand contrast with Midwinter\n\nMidwinter.png610x853 376 KB\n\nSo be concious of that when writing/storyboarding the next installments of Midwinter.\nAnd hey we're on the same boat here, theres this theoritical sweetspot where our styles might reach its own ideal form.\nbut its a challenge everyone one of us western manga folk have to face!\nSo bottoms up, here to like...that!\ntakes a shot"", 'Thank you so much for this! It\'s been difficult to get even broad feedback like that so I appreciate it. It\'s really cool to hear you had already been reading it!\nThat\'s a very fair thing to point out. I think this also comes from my general thought that a fault of manga is when they talk so much during action sequences that are supposed to be quick (less of a problem now as opposed to 10-20 years ago though, I admit). I may be taking it too far and letting it cause ""talking scenes"" to just be talking. Dialogue is definitely better served when the characters are still doing something or moving forward in some capacity.\nI\'ll keep that in mind when drafting the resolution after this fight (and going forward) since we want to focus more on building character relationships.

571,A New Type of Review Thread,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hi it's me, your friendly neighborhood art goblin, here to start somethin' hopefully positive and constructive. I don't think i'm the first person to put up this topic, nor do I think I'll be the last, but lets get a real-life review thread rollin'.
This is a thread for critiques and feedback. Here you can post your comics and I will do my best to go through them all and give my two cents through the lens of my classical illustration training and general 5 years reading other people's webcomics and messing around with the medium myself. Hopefully others will join me in doing this!
HOWEVER, this is not a thread for everyone to only say ""good job! now review MY COMIC!"" because WHO ARE YOU HELPING? this is not a thread to gain notoriety/exposure for your comic, it is a thread to genuinely give and receive feedback so we can all become better artists and writers together!
so, some ground rules: 

TO POST YOUR COMIC, YOU MUST PROVIDE A THOUGHTFUL AND HELPFUL CRITIQUE FOR AT LEAST ONE OTHER COMIC IN THE THREAD- a good rule of thumb is to say at least one thing you like about the comic, one thing you dislike about the comic, and then recommend steps they can take to improve!
PLEASE ONLY POST ONE COMIC- let us focus on one work that you are either really proud of but want to improve or really concerned about and need help with! Even more helpful if you can point out what you're concerned about and ask others to focus on that!
BE HONEST-  is someone struggling with anatomy? tell them that and then kindly recommend they practice drawing from life! is someone's spelling so atrocious you're having a hard time paying attention to their beautifully rendered drawings? tell them that and then recommend a good spellchecking service! is someone's coloring making you physically ill? ask them to turn down their saturation! if someone is asking for feedback, give them proper feedback!
BE NICE- not everyone is trying to do this professionally, not everyone has as much experience or training as everyone else. you can't just say ""you suck!"" because again WHO ARE YOU HELPING? anyone who can't play nice with others will be reported and summarily shunned.

Disclaimer- I am by no means perfect, and neither is anyone else is this thread. You can take all advice with a grain of salt, knowing that all of us are just doing this for fun and none of us are experts. Everyone's just here to help!
To get the ball rolling, here's my own heart and soul, Sixty-Four, a comic with as many weaknesses as it has strengths. My number one problem is always that I hate drawing backgrounds and I have no idea how to summarize my plot into something cohesive. Hit me with it-

tapas.io13



Sixty-Four | Tapas
""Within the cradle of the Delphi, we are all safe."" These are the words that ring in Eloise Tacey's ears as she walks the dangerous streets of Orion, the holy capital of the modern world. Consumed with grief after the gruesome death of her beloved,...





","[""I like the artstyle and the designs, the story seems somewhat interesting at least so far with a lot of moving parts and likable characters. Overall I have to say it's a good job and well done, but if I had to complain about something I would say anything negative I have to say the plot seems to jump around to much, I know it's going somewhere but it seems to jarring.\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nBlade Quest Vol.1 :: Ch.1: Adventure’s Spirit | Tapas\nIn a world run by RPG logic a pair of childhood friends set out to start a guild hoping to make a name for themselves in the world. Chancing upon a legendary sword the two are fast tracked on a mysterious path involving an ancient war with the Gods...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""I love what you're doing with your colour palettes. Your lineart is solid, too. Very bold and easy to register.I do think some of your poses are a bit jagged and unnatural, but it is only evident in a few panels. I'd just work on getting your anatomy flowing more naturally - life drawing helps that.Drawing hands is something I'd focus on. You seem to struggle with a few specific hand positions and sometimes just doing a couple of sketch pages full of hands from life can really save your life (from my experience at least)Keep up those colour palettes though! I can't stress how nice they look. Your front covers are snazzy too.\nHere's my comic! I've had a change in art style so it would be best to review recent pages.\n\ntapas.io6\n\n\n\nFlirting With Death | Tapas\nA hitman with a taste for sex and blood.\nAn angel plagued by boredom.\nThey meet in the worst of ways, and it only gets worse when they fall in love.\nThe year is 1986, in the anarchist city of Jahannam!\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticism is good. I'm always looking to grow."", ""Alright let me start with the positive aspects, I like what your doing with the backgrounds. It works well for what your doing especially the inside and more stylistic scenes.The plot seems pretty interesting, your obviously going somewhere and the characters are just assholish enough to believe they live in a darker world, but not big enough assholes to make them unlikeable which is a nice balance.\nNow let me get onto the bad, I'm going to be honest I hate the character looks, their overall design works but in comic the humans just look uglyAnd sorry to say the action scenes also just look so lazy, I get it's supposed to be quick and simple but they just seem so lazy and when added onto the ugly humans it makes it even uglier.\nOverall I have to say it's a decent read, nothing to spectacular but it's something that has the potential to be a lot better.\n\n\ntapas.io3\n\n\n\nBlade Quest Vol.1 | Tapas\nIn a world run by RPG logic a pair of childhood friends set out to start a guild hoping to make a name for themselves in the world. Chancing upon a legendary sword the two are fast tracked on a mysterious path involving an ancient war with the Gods...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'I totally get that my rough and not-so-pretty style can be unappealing... Thanks for pointing that one out because I\'m usually a bit uncertain about it. I guess that\'s what polarizes people from what I draw. I can\'t bring myself to make my characters too pretty. Maybe I\'m just too stubborn in my ""ugly dark world"" outlook and need to balance it out just a bit more. I find that at least half of the facial expressions look a bit creepy, especially in early pages.I totally get it about the action scenes too. The ones earlier on in my comics didn\'t look too fluid. I was having a hard time with my art style and the composition suffered for it. Gah. I\'m working on that though. It\'ll get better.\nI appreciate that, bud. Your comments about my writing and background drawing are really reassuring because I struggle with backgrounds. I\'m glad the plot was cool to you!', 'Heya @nikaalexandra! This is a really cool idea! Love it! \nI hope you\'re cool if I review your work? I promise I\'ll do my best to make it helpful. \nOkay so, first thing I notice is that your backgrounds could use a lot of work. I can tell you\'re really focused on getting to the characters and action, and I totally hear that, but maybe this idea will help? Think of your backgrounds and settings as characters too. They have a mood and personality, and they\'ll even react to what\'s going on around them (like a background going red when there\'s danger). The little bakery is super cute, and I love the look of it, but it\'s so unfinished that it\'s distracting to the rest of the art. If you\'re looking for an easier way to get that stuff done, may I suggest obtaining a free copy of the old version of SketchUp and building your sets? It works wonders for us, and it\'s a lot more fun to color a background when it\'s already there! I can see that you sometimes ""cheat"" on showing the setting by focusing in on the details of it, like the cakes and candies in the bakery. I only say ""cheat"" because I lack a better term, and to be frank, that method TOTALLY works! It provides a moment of what Miyazaki calls ""ma"" or a moment to breathe and take in the surroundings and sink in what\'s happened in the story. That\'s a good feather to keep in your cap. \nI\'m really happy that you opened on a crowd scene though! It\'s well done, feels kinda crushing and overwhelming and I love how warm and brightly colored it is. Crowd scenes are a pain in the ASS and to start there? Well hats off to you for even attempting it! The character designs you have are simple, and I think that\'s a good thing. A lot of folks have this tendancy to create characters that have so much detail that it makes drawing the comic a total chore. Simple characters work.\nOn the writing side, I\'m seeing a lot of telling and not showing. Like for example, Hadrian is basically explaining everything to Eloise bar-none. I get you need the reader to understand the world and what\'s going on, but you could have dropped the festival thing on the very first page. You had crowds. You had kids and festival folks giving out goodies. Let the crowd talk. Let your extras provide some bread crumbs to the audience. \nDialogue is often very ""on the nose."" In case you\'re not familiar with the term (or if you are feel free to skip), ""on the nose"" means dialogue or action in which the character\'s innermost thoughts and feelings are fully expressed by what the character is saying or doing. There is no nuance, mystery, ambiguity or surprise. The way it was driven home to me is this: On the nose dialogue is what your character is thinking but it\'s not what they\'re going to say out loud. Think of an argument you\'ve had, did you say every last thought in your head? Sometimes you can get away with a lot more by saying less. This is a great resource if you\'re interested in tackling it. A heads up that it\'s a screenwriting resource though, but the lesson still applies to comics.\nI hope that was helpful? I really love the direction your comics going in, and I can see from the first page to the last that you\'ve definitely improved over time. Keep it up, bb <3 \nNow, here\'s mine. suits up in hockey gear Okay, y\'all hit me with all you got!! \n\ntapas.io6\n\n\n\nKamikaze | Tapas\nTwo centuries after a global ecological disaster, the worlds of a mysterious covert operation and a young courier collide when a critical mission is blown.\nUnwittingly thrown into a life or death game of espionage and sabotage the courier has to...\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'wow thanks for participating guys! and thanks for the great feedback, you\'re giving me a lot to think about and work on!\n@darkone4587: thanks for bringing up novels! i can\'t say i\'m great with writing and prose, but i can give you some ideas just as a bystander.  You obviously have a lot of world-building and backstory to get to, and i\'m getting that sense from the dialogue between the characters rather than narrative exposition which is always nice (i\'m a real sucker for dialogue based narratives). On the flip side of that though, while you threw us right into the action,  you reveal so little within the first paragraph that i found myself scrambling to figure out what was happening and with which characters, trying to piece together things as information was actually provided. i\'m actually not sure how to tackle that, but i think maybe giving an eensy beensy bit of exposition/setting before throwing us right into the action would be clarifying (for me at least)\n@wumblebumarts woah! you say i\'ve got good color palettes, but have you seen yours! they\'re so fun and  eye-catching! especially with a genre title like ""flirting with death"" the way you color and the semi-realistic way you render tells me within the first few pages that i\'m in for a fun (probably dark!) ride. you\'re obviously also really versed in rendering automobiles (teach me!) and i\'ve taken special note of jase\'s white boots as a pair i need for myself OTL I wish you had kept up the cell-shading through the comic! the first few pages were so action packed and detailed that it\'s a little jarring when you stop. also, some of your panels are begging to have some sweet, sweet environments in the back of them, to really ground your characters in a time and place. that program @Kamikaze recommended, sketch-up, is really good for this! (even though i am terrible at actually adhering to that advice!) i would also definitely try and stray from using real-life derogatory slang like r*****d in your comic. it does provide sort of an emotional read on your character\'s personalities, but it\'s more offensive than anything. you can always come up with your own in universe terms that would provide more depth to your world building and still have the same dialogic effect!\n@Kamikaze  hot damn, great atmosphere! your character designs are clean and recognizable, and very well structured to boot! i\'ll be the first to admit your chapter title had me humming ""run, rabbit, run"" too. i don\'t really have a lot to say in the way of criticism, other than since your comic was tackled by a team, i\'m assuming you have a separate person for backgrounds and character actions? it throws me off in a few panels, because of how crisp and defined the characters are vs how digitally rendered the backgrounds are. i don\'t want to say it\'s loose, because it\'s not but i can\'t think of a better term for it, but theres definitely moments where the environment they exist in doesn\'t seem real? if that makes sense? i get more tron vibes than anything, and i haven\'t come across any indication that the story operates in a digital realm. i think the way to amend that would be to bring some of the background elements into the characters (like the softness of the textures or the missing line elements) and vice versa to the background (defining certain objects with hard lines and flat color), especially in moments like this one where rabbit interacting with a previously undefined foreground object suddenly has it rendered differently. bringing the styles together would make it one cohesive work imo \nvery cool! thanks so much for sharing, all! this has been such a treat!', ""Let me chime in with my own two cents. I'm going to cover Sixty-Four and Flirting with Death because Blade Quest and Kamikaze are a bit too long for me to tackle right now. \n@nikaalexandra I really enjoyed your comic. Firstly, I love all of the details you put into building your world. You've obviously thought things through and it translates into a setting that feels coherent and natural, and above all interesting! The plot is easy to follow because it's driven by Eloise and Asher, and all the other information you've thrown in sort of orbits around their arc. While Isis is probably my favourite character at this point, all of your character designs and personalities are cool so far. You plant a lot of promising seeds with the royal family, the border conflict and the various other factions involved, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how the Fortunata deal with being in the middle of all that.\nI thought your art needed some work on the earlier pages. Most of that was ironed out later in the comic. When you draw from unconventional angles (say, looking at a face from below), your confidence seems to take a dip and the art suffers. Nothing a lot of practice drawing won't fix, of course - the challenging views are challenging for a reason, and you'll easily master it with time. A minor gripe, really, and in no way did it distract from my enjoyment of your comic. Well done!\n@wumblebumarts Your description says that the story is set in the eighties, and your art definitely demonstrates it with the colour palette. The gun-happy, lecherous hitman is a trope that honestly never ceases to amuse if done the right way, and the angel at this point gives off just enough mystery to keep the reader intrigued. From the evidence on display, your characters are obviously living in a crapsack world and I can see you're pulling no punches in that regard, with the violence and death on full display. Settings like that are interesting (again, if done well), and I felt that I wanted to find out more about the world they inhabit.\nI wasn't too crazy about the colouring. I realize that a lot of it is probably intentional, but to this pair of eyes there were panels that felt very gaudy to look at, not helped by the blaring, flat coloured backgrounds. The changing colours of the background can work to your disservice because they can lead the reader to believe that the scene has shifted to a different location when, in fact, it hasn't. This happened to me during the bar fight scene, so it may be something you could address in the future. Your plot at this point shifts focus a bit too much for my liking, and events feel somewhat disconnected at this point. I wasn't sure where the story was going, but not in a good way. Showing character motivation and allegiances, and hinting at their connections, does wonders in this regard. \nIf anyone feels like tackling it, I would appreciate feedback on my series. \n\n\ntapas.io5\n\n\n\nBiophilia | Tapas\nWelcome to the International Biophilia Institute! On the outside: a modern, organized and highly revered place of higher learning that attracts young people from around the globe who wish to perfect the mysterious gift of biophilia. On the inside… ...\n\n\n\n\n\n"", '@Mr_B thank you so much! as for biophilia, oh man your linework is great! really throws me back to old school mystery manga like ""the enigma of the amigara fault"". you also obviously have an affinity for drawing architecture and animals, and i love the little details you throw into the background of conversational panels to keep your reader interested. i also laughed out loud a lot at the way you use text as a visual element to enhance your character\'s personalities, very unique! i\'m actually surprised, because you seem to be very competent at drawing clothing and anatomy, but it\'s almost as if a whole other artist is inputting facial features- they seem so out of place! i\'m unsure if this is a stylistic move, but it\'s a little distracting when trying to immerse myself in the story. i think you would benefit from der-shing helmer\'s thoughts on facial anatomy and expressions!1 \nthanks for sharing!', ""And thank you for the feedback! I'm surprised that you said that I have an affinity for architecture, because that is the one thing that I cannot stand drawing!  Like, whenever a panel in my comic requires me to draw a building of any kind I just want to jump out the window so I wouldn't have to work on it. As for the faces, that's just the way I draw - no deliberate stylistic choice or effect that I wanted to achieve. I think I really struggle with eyes, to be honest, as well as achieving facial symmetry in general. Thank you for sharing the tutorial. I looked through it, and I do use a lot of the tricks and tips it suggests already - I just need to get better at it through practice! "", 'Are novels welcome? c:', ""I'm late to the party, but I'd love to give some feedback for Biophilia.Honestly? I really enjoyed it. The power of biophilia is alternatively silly and awe-inspiring, and the comic has fun playing around with its weird possibilities while also addressing its moral implications. It's a very interesting and inventive concept.The writing is equally strong. The gags are well-timed and funny, and while the characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be (maybe because there's a ton of them) they are likeable and their dialogue and interactions feel natural. I'd say your comic's greatest strength is probably the pacing; not a single scene lasted longer than it needed to.Now for the not-so-good! I know it's been said already, but there's still a little awkwardness in the faces. They're not too bad when viewed from the front, but your mouths and eyes start drifting off into weird directions when the face is in 3/4 view, and the whole head looks a little squashed when viewed from the side. Andrew Loomis (his books are on the internet in pdf form) has a method for measuring where the facial features will go when the head is rotated, and proko.com has great tips for figure drawing in general. But hey, your faces look a lot better than they did in the earliest pages.Other notes? You excel at drawing really fine details, like the wrinkles in clothing (holy, do those ever look good), but since the shading is minimal the art has little weight or depth. The hair is either a mess of details or a flat, two dimensional shape pasted onto the head; think of hair as a three dimensional mass, with areas of light and dark. Also, the line weights don't vary a lot; I'd recommend outlining characters with a slightly thicker line than the lines you use for details or backgrounds. Lastly, the varying font sizes were a little distracting.Overall, I really like your work, and it deserves more subs than it's got.

572,Reviewing comics! (offer closed),Reviews | Feedback,[],"So I'm going to try and up my skills in reviewing webcomics. Mainly because I'd like to eventually start a youtube series on Webcomic making and tips and tricks and I'd like to attune my reviewing skills on comics. I hope to have a reviewing structure of giving both good and critical critiques. I hope not to offend anyone and my reviewing is purely just how I learned to structure webcomics over the years so you don't have to take any of my advice if you don't want to. Everyone learns to draw and create comics their own way UvU I might be a bit slow cause I can only read so fast and think up a good review. The more pages and more plot oriented the story its the longer my review may be.
So I'll be reviewing the comic in a more private setting. I will privately message the review on your wall and you can reply and interact with me. If you want your review more Public just let me know and I can just reply here. What I'm going to be looking at is bubble placement, panel flow, style, readability, and some art. I'm not going to critique too much on grammar because even I mess up on that, but if something is noticeable I'll tell you. 
Also if you want you can review me back publicly here or in a private message on my wall. But you don't have to, just thought it might be fair if you wanted to do it back to me. HAHA

Chewing Gum An Angel's Mission | Tapas
“Music is like love. The lyrics are the words of your heart. The melody is the rhythm of your soul.”

The world of two members of The No Name Band turns into a rock star ride when they meet the two hottest guys, Blaine and Soul of The Jupits.
A...






I will wait for your comments and responses.
^_^","['Salutations!\nWell I have read through your story and I though I\'d give you some feedback as per your request!  \nThe first thing I want to start with is, I actually found it quite charming that each of the characters had a last name that was musically related. (Harmony, Serenade, Lullaby, etc,) Now, granted, I know that if you were doing a more serious piece this could get in the way of the narrative but, with your story being more plucky, it actually works. It keeps your story upbeat and establishes a mellow atmosphere in that you\'re not taking the story drop dead serious, so the levity is well translated. I also like that you start off in the middle of action and a concert where atmosphere is the character more than anything, it helps establish your story and you lay early groundwork here that makes a nice preface for the tone of your story to come.\nI will say that the writing was a bit hard to follow because it was written in a manner more befitting a movie script than a novella. I felt more like I was reading a screenplay or stage directions than getting fully immersed. This comes from the use of -s instead of -ed at the end of your words. This makes your narrative sound passive and as a result, your descriptions feel like rapid fire run-downs than actual descriptions. For example:\n""As they scream the last number, the thunder of their voices is accompanied by the rhythmic booming of the band’s drums, the sound vibrating beneath their feet, followed by waves of electronic music grinding from a single guitar.""\nThis section could\'ve been a great way to establish the thick of the scene right from the off, however the -s endings make the narrative sound passive and as if it\'s in a hurry to finish it\'s thought so the next paragraph can come. This takes a reader out of the story because you almost feel like you\'re being shoved from point to point without the ability to absorb and revel in the scene because it\'s in a hurry somehow. This is just from a readers perspective, from my editing perspective, if I wanted to involve my audience I\'d use -ed at the end of the sentences because it puts the reader in the moment. Example using the same paragraph:\n""They screamed the last number, the thunder of their voices accompanied by the rhythmic boom of the drums. The sound vibrated beneath their feet, followed by waves of electronic music shredded from a single guitar.""\nNow, this is by no means perfect but, the difference in the action can make all the difference to a reader. The descriptions don\'t have to be purple prose, just targeted at eliciting feeling and emotion. You also have to be aware of the ""Passive Voice"" which is a chronic issue that crops up in everyone\'s writing, not just yours, haha. There are two ways that ""Passive Voice"" can ruin your narrative: by weakening your description and by adding additional words that aren\'t required for the description itself. Now, don\'t get me wrong, Passive Voice has a place and is very useful in that place, but when it comes to the kind of descriptions you\'re making here, it weakens the narrative.\nFor example: Your narrative has lot\'s of -ing words where -ed words would be better suited to keep the audience on board. Overuse of -ing becomes noticeable after a time and can wear out a reader. This doesn\'t seem to happen as much with -ed because, again, it\'s about being in the moment, showing versus telling. I will say this, you had a distinct lack of -ly words and that isn\'t a bad thing at all! They have their place too and can be great, but overuse of -ly words leads us to the same problem as overuse of -ing. However, you did not have both, which is awesome because that means you used more accurate words to make your descriptions and didn\'t need to rely on -ly. This is very refreshing to see from an editing stand point, so good on you!\nNow, beyond the technical stuff, one thing that did take me out of the narrative was the beginning where Blaine Harmony is introduced three times. (You give him three introductory paragraphs/scenes):\n-""In the audience, Blaine Harmony lifts his arms, fists pumping, welcoming his favorite performer along with the other ecstatic fans around him.""\n-""The feeling of a kindred excitement from the crowd as they sway, nod, and pump their arms with the music, fills one of the concert-goers, a young man named Blaine Harmony.""\n- "" Blaine Harmony, now the drummer in his own band, “The Jupits,” puts his drumsticks down across the top of the floor.""\nAfter the first time you introduce him as Blaine Harmony, you don\'t have to call him by his first and last name every time. That feels clunky and derailed my focus when I was reading. I know that this was done because you have a theme with the last names, but don\'t you worry, we the audience will definitely remember it. Because of the levity you established, it makes you smile as you get introduced to the others and hear their last names, which makes the first time you met Blaine all the more memorable. That memorability gets toppled if you re-introduce him too many times. I just wanted to give you a heads up about it because, I\'ve done bits where I write a paragraph later and make the same introduction twice, and if it weren\'t for another reader, I\'d have never caught myself! Haha so I didn\'t want to leave you in the lurch about it.\nNow, one thing I also enjoyed right from the off is Blaine actually seems like a fun person to follow from the beginning. Even if he\'s later described as being moody, you can see him really open up to the concert and crowd scene and how he sort of waxes romantic about this girl he\'s never met but can\'t forget. That\'s charming and I think it made a very good introduction to Blaine. I also love how naturally he and his band mates talked and interacted. I like how the dialogue flowed and these people actually felt like they knew each other and that\'s refreshing to find. Sometimes in the beginning of a novel even characters who are supposed to know each other, all feel like they\'re meeting each other for the first time. This didn\'t come off that way so I think you did very well there.\nOh! One thing I wanted to make you aware of: The transfer of thought from narrator is very murky a lot of the time. Example:\n-“Oh.” She looks down, her heart beating faster – those beautiful light grey eyes, his blond hair, the freckles…! OMG, he’s gorgeous! Who is he? And that smile is, oh, wow! She looks up and sees him run his fingers through his hair, a gesture that makes him somehow even cuter.""\nIt\'s very hard to determine whose viewpoint we\'re supposed to be following when scenes like this happen because the narrator is simultaneously inside and outside the characters head. This is also difficult because you have several characters who have view points and I can tell you I got confused and lost a few times because of transitions like this being unclear. The narrator sounds like a separate person from Vianne but then we\'re inside Vianne\'s thoughts as if she were the narrator. Here is a simple fix to help your readers determine what\'s happening when and in whose head:\n-"" “Oh.” She looked down, her heart beating faster – those beautiful light grey eyes, his blond hair, the freckles. He’s gorgeous! Who is he? And that smile is, oh, wow! She thought. Vianne looked up to see him run his fingers through his hair, a gesture that made him somehow cuter.""\nNow, you\'ll notice I didn\'t italicize this one. That\'s because thoughts are often italicized within a narrative so that a thought and the paragraph can be separated. This way the narrator doesn\'t blend into Vianne\'s thoughts and confuse the reader. I also got rid of extra words that slowed down your narrative. Often times words like ""Even"" or ""Absolutely"" are just extra and pump up your word count but don\'t contribute to the scene. Not every word is going to be like that but, if it\'s not a necessary word it runs the risk of gumming up story flow. To that end ""OMG"" feels clunky. I\'m not saying that people don\'t think it in their heads but I did fall out of the narrative because in a way, ""OMG"" feels out of place somehow. This just might be a personal thing on my part so, I won\'t be nuts about it, but I wanted to give you the heads up about it derailing me as a reader.\nI do have to tell you though: I love Kaia. Now, all issues with the narration aside, this girl has bundles of personality right from the second we meet her and she feels like a person immediately. This is fantastic writing on your part and it really shows off your chops in creating characters. In the brief few paragraphs we have with her to start off, she\'s breaking rules, being cheery, and getting back at her nemesis all with a tricksters natural flair and in half a Tapas page! I enjoyed her entire scene from beginning to end. I could read a whole book about Kaia just getting by being herself. She\'s a delightful character and she really shines. If there is one thing you really have in spades, its the way to make a character feel natural and interesting.\nHonestly I like your novella so far. It\'s charming, your characters all have a sort of wit about them, and I find that even with some of the issues I\'ve mentioned, I\'d love to see where this goes. Please keep writing, all of the things I mentioned above are things each author does, and, if you\'re running into issues, editing always helps. As such, I\'ve a tool for you to use (which I tend to hand out pretty liberally around here): EditMinion. This tool will help you to identify passive voice, weak word usage, and adverbs that don\'t flow. I\'ve found it to be very helpful. Here is a resource about writing in the third person as well, as your narrative seems to go back and forth as to whether or not it wants to be in the third person so, I figured some examples of things could be helpful.\nPhew, if you\'ve managed to get to the end of this thing, you are incredibly patient! I do wish you luck with everything and I hope my feedback is helpful for you. It\'s already a fun read so, that\'s the best way to start! A little fine tuning here and there will just go on to bolster the good that already exists. \nCheers!', ""Hi! \nThank you so much for your feedback.  I appreciate your time and effort for writing your helpful feedback.\nYes, I finished reading it from the beginning to the end. Hurray for me!\nThanks for reminding me about the thoughts of the character should be italicized so that it won't be confusing to the readers. \nI will try to change my story's tense into past tense.\nBecause of your comment about how you like Kaia's character, I'm thinking of writing a book about her.  \nI will always remember that I should only need to introduce my character once, not twice or thrice.\nThank you for the editing tools you gave me to help me with my writing. I will keep that in mind.\nAlso, I really like your comment about how my characters are natural and interesting. I will always remember that whenever I write about my characters in my other stories.\nYou gave me good information on how to write an effective story and I will apply your information to all of my stories.\nOverall, I'm happy with your positive feedback and also will keep in mind what you said to improve my story.\nThank you again!\n"", ""I'm glad my feedback could be of service!  You really do have great characters, I remember everybody and how they relate to each other and that can be hard to achieve even in those high-fantasy novels with their boat load of characters.\nI am all in favor of this. If you ever write a book about Kaia and post it, you've got to let me know, she's just a lark! \nThat's awesome to hear, I wish you all the best! I know you're going to make something amazing."", ""You too, I wish you all the best. Sure! If I post a story about Kaia here in Tapas, I'll let you know. "", ""Hello and good day!I really like your story so far. I am a fan of stories music related. I enjoyed the concert scene where Blaine Harmony met his Rock Star Girl.I hope to read more about Rock Star Girl soon.She is really an interesting character.I hope Blaine will see her again.I do like Soul a lot. I can imagine how cute he is with his long hair and deep sea blue eyes.I hope to know more about the descriptions of the other band mates in the following chapters.You should describe Blaine's band mates. It is the best thing thing to do to keep all the readers interested.Good luck and keep writing!"", ""Thank you for your feedback.\nI am happy you like my characters: Blaine, Rock Star Girl, and Soul.\nI will keep in mind what you said about describing the band mates.\nDon't worry, I described them in the following chapters.

Mainly I worked on better shot selections. Going back to playing with perspectives. Also I tried to experiment more with colors and develop my inks since people seemed to respond in kind.Anything else, I'd really appreciate.Super thanks in advanced!","[""Hi! It looks really good! The lines are bold and dramatic and the use of shadows it wicked! There is much more diversity of angles on the latest page which is what you were going for so good job! I guess I have two critiques to make:- sometimes, the shadows get a bit...too intense? Mostly on the faces, so I have difficulty discerning the expressions the characters are making. I don't really have a way to fix that except maybe providing more focus on the eyes? That always helps me when I'm struggling with expressions.-secondly, the backgrounds can be a bit underdeveloped in comparison to the characters in the foreground. I understand limiting the detail of the background to maintain focus on action, but...for example on much of the shading in the background, lines are a bit squiggly and thick? Perhaps try tapering them a bit more. Another easy solution is to blur the background a bit. It's a common technique in animation and such that allows for less detailed backgrounds but doesn't make them look messy.Oh and last thing, sometimes for the speech bubbles, the circle itself is really neat and clean but the part directed from the character can be a little squiggly as well. This is one my my own BIGGEST problems in my own comic work, so I completely get it, just pointing it out Best of luck!"", ""Thanks for the feedback! I'll definitely work on this for next page. Also awesome art btw"", 'glad I could help! and thanks so much ^_^', 'Hi! Your comic has a very unique style, very interesting! You definitely have something cool going on here, I like it!The biggest thing that kind of bugs me is the text and speech bubbles. The font looks like Arial, it\'s pretty boring. I\'d look into a nice comic font, there are plenty of great free ones on Fontsquirrel.comI\'m also personally not a fan of the square bubbles which look too neat, I\'d try to break it up by making the box wonky and uneven or perhaps adding rounded corners or something. Maybe make them a little bit more opaque to make them pop more.Finally, your text is mostly in a block or the bubbles are all on one side of the panel while the art is on the other. People tend to navigate through a page by going from bubble to bubble and their eye can skip over the art if you\'re not careful. It\'s a good idea to ""frame"" the art by putting some bubbles on one side, some on the other, making sure the eye has to go through the art to get to the next one (as much as possible of course!). It\'s also good to break up the text to convey the pace of the sentence, tone or pauses. Vary the size of the text, and break it up to indicate pauses. Here\'s an example from my comic of the things I talked about:\n\nFINAL_23.jpg619x807 394 KB\n', ""Thanks a ton for the insight on the speech. I've really neglected development in that area since most suggests completely kill the tension. You really nail them down well.  In your work"", ""Comics are a complicated media, there's so much to consider  It seems there's always more to learn... But we shall master the beast!"", ""Man, I won't be able to read your comic right now, but I will later, for sure.This feels really unique. Your art style is awesome. I liked it a great deal, I'm impressed.\nTo offer a second opinion (no easy answers here haha), I love the excess of shadows. I think it works with your style. It's almost impressionistic, in a way, pretty crazy.I also half agree with the lettering comment. I do think you could toy with different font sizes and the panels could be done a little more graciously. Last panel's dialogue box is misaligned, for example. And why is it kind of transparent? It only half works, for me.Still, I do think you can make some cool effects with a font and style like that, this more designy boxed formal choice in storytelling. I'd recommend one of the comics written and drawn by Jonathan Hickman. I think he does something similar from what you tried with great elegance. \n\n\n2\nThe only thing I kind of dislike on this page is actually all the angles. They actually feel really arbitrary, more an exercise in form than in storytelling. The way I see it, the constant changing of angles doesn't enhance or represents the story being told. Why is panel 5 shot in an extreme plongee angle? Because it looks cool? You know. Panel 8 also looks like someone is watching wolf guy. It's a convention and the mind simply wonders when you see it, you know. At least done it this way. The way I see it, an angle should serve the story. And it's not like it's bad, it's really well done, it just seems to mean nothing. Angles change so much and so drastically it ends up meaning nothing, it distracts me. I don't know if you read something by Steve Dillon (Preacher, yeeahh) or Inio Asano (Solanin, Nijigahara Holograph), but I think their style is amazing because they're so economic and spot on with their storytelling choices. Preacher's storytelling is so tight it's crazy.\nStill, that's the only thing. Your art style is amazing and the narrative gives this really expansive, ''cinematographic'' feel. The aesthetic seems like a crazy Shadowrun inspired action nightmare. Keep on going!!"", 'Thanks for the feedback especially on the panels. Very useful insight.

Certain color combinations will make others pop based on how they relate to each other. Opposites and thirds around the wheel mix well for foregrounds and backgrounds. I think it's panel 2 on page 31 of your comic that does that very well with the reds and greens accenting each other."", ""Pfff that's funny cuz I think having the patients to make anything of quality with digital is admirable.  Back in high school I tried out the medium for a year or so, it was insanely unsatisfying, I couldn't take it seriously enough to finish many illustrations.  The over abundance of colour choices, and tools was also a little overwhelming.  I've abandoned the medium entirely except occasionally messing with the note program, and stylus on my phone for quick life sketches or thumbnails.There's nothing like the feeling of art crap all over your hands... and clothes... and furniture.\nI am familiar with both, and reference the color wheel regularly.  Picking up this habit of using the opposite color of the base for shadows, and colors in between for mid-tones.  Everything is a rainbow mess.  But I'd be lying if I said I totally understood, and wasn't a chicken-shit about using color theory.  I analyze the hell out of art works that are great examples of that, and color composition.  Watching videos on the subject, read tutorials, and the struggle to apply that to my own work is so real.  Being a literal type also makes things challenging.Once I start getting to the experimental, surrealish parts of my comic I'll hopefully feel more comfortable with going buck wild with color too.  Thank you for the compliment, though! Reds with greens, and teals is some of my favorite stuff."", ""We're all constantly trying to find what works and experimenting along the way. I think that's what makes the creative process worthwhile. Keep up the good work, though. I look forward to having some time to check out your comic."", 'Hell yeah, the journey is always the best part!\nThank you for the encouragement! ', 'Bumping this up every few days until I get at least 2 critiques... or until everyone tells me to fuck off.', 'I orginally wasn’t going to critque because I follow your comic, but thought why not. I am your audience after all.\nOver all (obviously) I enjoy the story. I am a very patient reader and enjoy a bit of mystery and charcter development. I believe you succeeded in these areas. I am intrested to find out more about your story and your charcters. I am already invested in Julian even though he hasn’t even been formally introduced. The emotion behind the prologue and memories Apollo has of him make him a sympathetic character that i want to learn more about.\nAs for Apollo, I don’t like him. Not in a bad way, in an emotional way, which I believe was your goal. Tell me if I’m wrong. Apollo seems selfish, but I have small hope for him. Kinda like the drug addicted realtive that swears they are gonna change this time even though you’ve given them so many chances. So you tell them you won’t help them this time and walk away from them but silently hope that they do turn it atound even as you leave them to deal with their own shit.\nI don’t trust him either. I don’t want him to be back in contact with Julian because he my be toxic for him. I don’t know all of Julians story but your pacing and bits and peaces of information you have given make me protective of him.\nAs for things that cah be improved on. I occasionally have a hard time keeping up with the mutiple side charcters, but that might just be my bad memory.\nI also read on mobile (I am not always well enough to be on a computer) and while it is not horrible to read on mobile some mobile only users would probably not find your formatting friendly. Your beautifully detailed pages have less impact on mobile and just seem cluttered. For example I believe in chapter 2 pg 10. The movment and many tiny panels where not plesent for me.\nYour speech bubles are mostly good and i can read them, but occasionally they get squeezed. I don’t know if it is the font or the bubble size but especially B’s seem to hug up on other letters to close making it hard to read on mobile.\nI’m not saying change the formatting, but be aware that it is not mobile friendly. Most reader aren’t like me who has read a whole novel on a small phone. Some will find it to hard to read, and not invest the time to enjoy the story.', ""Ah, thank you, @UbePie! Sorry for the text wall!\nSeeing how other people interpret my characters, and story is always interesting! Your reaction to my two main characters is funny (not in a bad way) since feelings have been mixed, some being the exact opposite; rooting for Apollo while not liking Julian all that much.  I’m partially surprised you’re invested in Julian already, I was just expecting readers to think they look pretty-ish at this point, given that’s the usual first response I get.  But I should realize some people can empathize with a character sporting a bad childhood, and a history of being suicidal.For a character that can be super cliche, but it's not like that doesn't happen irl.\nWith Apollo, I intended for him to appear like an innocent cinnamon roll type, and I do want him to have an extent of a child-like ignorant innocence.  But personality wise Apollo is totally bratty, ablest, bigoted, and moronic.  So yeah, how you feel about him is totally valid! Although I do want to leave some things neutral, like whatever readers feel about characters and their actions.  As long as the important stuff is seen in a mostly universal way I'm pretty chill… if that makes sense.But that is super nice! Julian does need people to be protective of them.\n\n\nUbePie:\nAs for things that cah be improved on. I occasionally have a hard time keeping up with the mutiple side charcters, but that might just be my bad memory.\nLol nooo, it’s not you! While there are some characters that have little purpose in the story as a whole, like Don the beefy black dude, I do have a habit of neglecting my more important side characters a bit.  Some of them have hardly even gotten a name drop, which I might fix when I back to fix the speech bubbles for the older pages someday.  I definitely want to add names more in the future.\n\n\nUbePie:\nI also read on mobile (I am not always well enough to be on a computer) and while it is not horrible to read on mobile some mobile only users would probably not find your formatting friendly. Your beautifully detailed pages have less impact on mobile and just seem cluttered. For example I believe in chapter 2 pg 10. The movment and many tiny panels where not plesent for me.\nOh no, someone said it! I was suspicious about this, and prepared for my comic to possibly not be mobile-friendly given my choice to make a story more reliant on small visual details.  Also my affinity for visual detail, and stuff like that.\nTo be honest I’m 95% a desktop reader, only using a phone when I really want to read a comic and my work computer has a site blocked.  When looking on my phone, I’m legit blind to what is and isn’t mobile-friendly unless the term is plastered on the comic somewhere.  Even then I still can't tell the difference that much.  That being said, I know absolutely nothing about mobile-friendly-ness outside of a couple things I’ve read:1. Mobile peeps like vertical scrolling, vertical comics, with all the pages being smooshed into one episode.2. From what I can gather large panels that are more spaced out, simplistic, with large speech bubbles are preferred.\nI gave up on the latter the moment I heard about it given I felt it would have some negative affects on the comic and update schedule.  Vertical scrolling is something I’m just being a stubborn ass about.  I didn’t like it the moment it came out, it made pages really slow to load, so its existence was kinda dead on arrival for me.While I may not be able to make too many changes (I do intend to keep my comic mostly print friendly for if I ever self-publish), I’d really like to know what you feel makes a mobile-friendly comic to help me have a better understanding of it… if you wouldn’t mind.\n\n\nUbePie:\n\nYour speech bubles are mostly good and i can read them, but occasionally they get squeezed. I don’t know if it is the font or the bubble size but especially B’s seem to hug up on other letters to close making it hard to read on mobile.\nI’m not saying change the formatting, but be aware that it is not mobile friendly. Most reader aren’t like me who has read a whole novel on a small phone. Some will find it to hard to read, and not invest the time to enjoy the story.\n\nIt might be a little of both? Sometimes I unintentionally make my handwriting a little too large or the bubble to narrow, having to resize things photoshop, and making it all look sloppy.  I have been trying to mind the sizing and clarity of my letters, but there has been a little trial and error.I have gotten suggestions to use digital font, but for me the experience is about as mind-blowingly awful as driving… I hate driving, it’s just the worse thing.  I wish I could be a hermit in the mountains, living off the grid, running everywhere like a maniac.\nANYWAYS, I will work harder to make my handwriting better, and be more cautious about my sizing.\nLastly, oh my god, you read books on your phone?? Jesus, how do you not get a migraine?\nThank you again for your feedback! I really appreciate it!"", 'With the mobile friendly thing, I don’t think you have to reformat into vertical scroll. Just make larger bubbles  and lettering and it will be easier to read. If you want you can do larger panels to or more space indetween panels so it doesn’t feel cluttered, but it would be a waste to reformat. Like you said you are keeping it print friendly, and there are weirdos like me that will read it on their phone either way.\nI am very attached to my phone, it gives me freedom. I wrote that whole review and this response on my phone too, lol.', 'Good god! I\'m too much of an old coot to get that much into mobile devices!... or technology in general really.  But I understand the feeling of freedom, I used to to have a bicycle that felt just amazing to ride around on! Although anymore anyone who rides a bike in my city is likely to join the ""pro-cyclist club"" via getting hit by a car.\nAnyways! You\'re not a weirdo, a lot of people I\'ve come across do consider mobile-friendly to be a major factor in whether they\'ll read a comic or not.

","[""Hey! So I read through your comic (skimmed the middle a bit but will get back to it!) and I pretty much only have good things to say!I see a lot of improvement from the start of your comic to the current pages. First, your line work becomes more clear. While it begins with a more sketchy feel with thinner lines, it becomes bolder in it's current state, which helps define the characters. The location of speak bubbles, their shape, and the text, really does look much more clean and easier to read and look at. The colors also become much more vibrant, which is really fun!I guess my only critique is that sometimes, I lose the actual setting of the scene. For example, the shift from the field to the canyon seems a bit sporadic. While the shift in colors is very contrasting and well done, it is somewhat easy to lose track of how the characters shift location and how  they are located in the space. For the plateau they are on, how does it relate to the overall space? While I can tell that if we are on the right side of the characters Jin is sitting on the side closer to the edge while they are in front of him, the size of the canyon is undefined. I know this is defined on the previous page, but I think that an overview panel would help with orientation.Also, smaller suggestion, if possible, keep the bubbles off the actual characters and instead in pre-planned spaces (an example of such an overlap is the third to last panel of the latest page). Overall, great job,congrats on a year, and best of luck with Axis and your art overall!If you want to check out my comic please do!

The Chronicler :: Chapter 3 - Pages 9-10 | Tapas
Sorry about the hiccup in upload schedule. Spent the last two weeks doing paid gigs. Now back to my comic about ants.





","[""sorry to hear you're sick! i hope you feel better soon!\nas for your comic-woah! great lines! incredible rendering! really loving the fact that even though your characters have very few defined and unique characteristics, they're still easy to recognize and identify with. your text is clean and consistent too, which is usually the first thing i pick up on as something to critique in webcomics- great work over all! i'm getting a major zelda/raiders of the lost ark vibes which i LOVE\ni guess the only thing i can pick on here is the lack of depth perception in your panels, it's difficult to separate the characters and objects from the environments they exist in because of the detailed linework all around, and i'd hate to see such hard work get lost like that! incorporating either faded lines or missing lines for the background, making them less detailed than the subjects of the panels, or maybe even adding a light blur to add a cinematic feel and better depth perception would really make your comic shine in my opinion!\noverall, great work! feel better!"", ""Reading through what you've got I've determined a few things about it:\nStrengths:Your story telling is paced fairly well - no panels that don't belong, and everything is indicated with decent enough precision. Your dialogue is charming sometimes, and generally keeps readers interested. I enjoy the character dynamic - they're funny together and enjoyable to read.The character designs are endearing and unique - a species with a mouth on its torso is pretty inventive, as is an ant person.Your linework is strong and your environments look confident. You tend to keep the setting in mind and indicate it in many of the panels which really benefits the atmosphere to a certain extent. Good job expressing their faces, too - non-conventional faces are difficult to emote but you manage to make it work decently. I can tell what characters are feeling, and they read naturally.Your paneling works well - you use the size and shape of your windows quite effectively.\nImprovements:As previously mentioned, some depth/contrast might need improvement.. As your comic is not in colour this won't be as easy but perhaps a bit more indication into the setting's lighting would help. If our characters are supposedly in a tomb lit only by torches, perhaps there should be a lot of shadowy corners and the lighting shouldn't be so even. Lighting really effects the mood.Your word bubble placement is a bit all over the place. I'd recommend trying to make them flow downward over the page. Mark Crilley explains it very well on his channel, if you need more explanation. The idea is to make the reader's eyes flow from bubble to bubble naturally - left to right and top to bottom. this means your word bubbles should begin high and leftward, and flow downward and towards the right. Sometimes your bubbles are in a weird order, and I can't tell which comes first. This is only an issue on a few pages but it does bother me.\nHope it helps you :^O I like what you've got so far.""]",10/31/2017 12:54,https://forums.tapas.io/t/sick-in-bed-today-so-who-wants-to-review-my-comic/21110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm looking forward to learning more about Mr. Beaver and his past, and am interested in finding out how the zodiac symbols will figure into the nature of the 12 hinted villains.  So, keep up the good work.\nI have two series here on Tapas.

Watching him fight against superpowered enemies will be interesting if you do it creatively. Heroes who rely in their brains can be very interesting but it can be tricky to write. But you are doing great.\nWhile some people here pointed out some cliches like the ""i work alone"", that`s not necessarily a bad thing if you know what you are doing.Cliches can be good or bad depending how you use them.

But I sort of like the cross between The Dark Knight/Howard the Duck, but a beaver. I don't think the story needs to be ground breaking as it is already highly enjoyable to read and well executed. \nI do hope to get some sort of explanation as to why there is a talking Beaver in a world of normal-seeming humans, but that explanation isn't necessary to understand and enjoy the story so far. \nOver all I hope to read more!"", 'Thanks diego for the review and comments , also thanks for the youtube advise ']",10/25/2017 17:54,https://forums.tapas.io/t/need-feedback-give-you-feedback/21042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hope to hear from you guys.","[""Dear Mom:A very interesting concept. Kind of reminded me of Anne Frank, but it's not everyday you get to see something like this!

The words clearly described her inner struggles and conflict. Very good indeed.\nLife Fragments:Every chapter has a different kind of character; be it their mental age, how they talk, or their motives, all of them left me speechless.

I used to do this thing on Wattpad where I would critque people's stories and give them advice and stuff. I finally have time to do something like that again, and I'd love to offer some help to the creators here! I'm a little out a of practice though, so sorry if the critiques end up a little short~
I'll review any genre with any rating, my only limits being length. If you've got like... a 20 chapter comic with really long chapters, it might be best to direct to me the chapter (or chapters) you specifically want a critique on .3.

Some jokes weren't as funny as others, but most of them were able to make me laugh. Especially the more recent ones (Hands was one of my favorite episodes tbh)-The backgrounds, when they do happen, often look very nice. \nCons: -The characters themselves are a bit lack-luster, as I generally can't tell when new characters have been introduced (if at all). Though, I guess they don't matter since the strong-point here is the jokes (and it was lightweight addressed in the Diversity episode) it is still something to keep in mind. Even ignoring the character designs, their proportions are a bit off all around. (Really big necks, noodly arms, etc). -While a majority of the jokes are good, there are a few that fall flat simply because they're confusing. Examples of this would be Expired or This Restaurant\nOther: -The character page seemed random and a little pointless (but hey, maybe it was another Meta joke). If so, disregard this point-Have you thought about using a different/better font for your comic?

We live in a tremendously creative world and you can never let one person\'s opinion hold you back from doing something incredible. Now on to the review.*\nRoryReview#1 Voidchild*The reviewVoidchild is a unique story being told with great effort and passion from an amateur artist. While constantly striving to improve their artwork, Voidchild gets better visually as you continue through each page. Though the artist is new and learning to draw as they create each page, it certainly does not take away from the story elements and dialogue. Voidchild does a great job of creating mysterious characters with uncertain motives. With alot of time and effort Voidchild has the potential to be a very well done comic.\nI split my review in two sections, this is where I will list things that may be in error or just general ideas which could help you improve.\n*The fix- There are a few minor dialogue mistakes - A little homework on dialogue bubbles will help you tremendously, I feel it can get a bit confusing to tell who is talking and using the bubbles to point at characters in or out of frame will help clean things up.- You love to use heavy white which takes away from your background. Look into contrast which you have some great uses of in your comic, if you can bring some more contrast to your pages they will go from ""ok"" to ""stunning"".\nOverall I hope this helps, please continue to strive for the best you can do!!!

590,Got a completed series? Or know about some completed series’? Share them here!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"So, finishing a series is sorta a bittersweet thing, on the upside YOU DID IT! You told a whole complete story and that's really rad! On the downside though, people are going to have a much harder time finding it now that it's not updating. So it's sorta in limbo unless you're doing another series, in which case someone might find it while visiting your page, maybe? occasionally?
Point is, Finished series deserve more attention so I wanna help by starting this thread!

Here are some of my favorite completed series on tapastic, most of these are minicomics, finished longforms are tough to find X_X


tapas.io10



Keep an Eye | Tapas
A comic that was done on the 24 hour comics challenge in October 2015. Decided to color all the pages in my spare time and share them fully colored little by little. 

Support me and this project on:...





This one has a pretty neat interesting surreal-ness to it, without being so confusing that it doesn't mean anything.

APOTHECIA | Tapas
11-year-old Jessie is the only person in the world who knows about the existence of an enormous alien that is trapped in the woods behind her house. It's one of the most horrible and murderous beings in the universe. It is also the only one that will...





REALLY good dialogue in this comic.


tapas.io5



The Pinewood Curse | Tapas
The full moon is high and the were-beast runs amok! On this fateful night, Anne is determined to bring an end to the creature's rampage, by her own hand.

Art and story by Stéfanie Meunier (stef-the-frizz.tumblr.com), with writing input by Jon...





I haven't read very much of this one but its artwork is stunning, really reminds me of Emily Carroll's comics, but as a longform.


tapas.io11



For it to grow | Tapas
An assistant and her apothecary live on the outskirts of town by a forest. In her search for a mushroom thief, the assistant finds something else instead.





This one made me cry. It's probably my favorite out of all of these.

Dust contains particles from

------from a variety of-------
-------known sources-------
-----------such as:-----------
-------------Dirt,-------------

592,Critique Swap-Read my comic and I’ll read yours!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey there! I thought it might be fun to do a critique swap/review swap. I'm always looking for ways to improve  Read my comic, write a little review or critique and I'll do the same for yours! My comic: Abby Normal: Ghost World23 is only 8 pages! Shouldn't be too hard to review. If you have a longer comic, it may take me some time to read it. But let's do it!","[""I'd love to give a critique  Is there anything in particular you want me to look at? Should I just write it in a comment on your last page or? \nMy comic is The Changeling's Sister3. It's 36 pages right now, I hope that's fine :3"", ""alright, i wouldnt mind a critique for There was a War3 (but bear in mind the art changes and improves significantly in later episodes)\nas for abby normal. lets start by saying this is so cute. from the tone to the characters. i really like the potential for a (grand)mother/daughter type relationship here, rarely seen in comics, and i love how carefree nana is. also, your palettes are very nice, and add to the kinda sweet vibe you got here. the switch to blue for the later pages is really nice for drastically changing the mood as well. im not sure abt the warm pinks used in the first few pages though; they seem to contrast with the emotions being expressed, and i wonder how a lilac palette would effect the mood. that said, its not smth i dislike, like the low contrast and saturation makes me think of summertime depression, so its still got an effective emotional connotation.\nyour composition is also nice and clear, and its clear you understand the concept of throwing a light on the area of focus. but i think you could increase your contrast between light and dark; have lighter lights and - more importantly - darker darks. i dunno if the slightly faded look is intentional, but i think higher contrast could really increase the pages' impact sometimes.\nyour backgrounds are very nice, detailed enough and effective at drawing the eye to the characters. i think theyre very pretty and set the scene well, and i love the kinda felt-tip-pen looking starry skies. they remind me of childrens illustrated books, you have to show me how you did that. but again, levels could be your friend here. like:this is a very very nice background, but what if you darkened those trees? what if you made the buildings more shadowed as they move further from the characters, and higher contrast on the light thrown on the building theyre sat on? it could really increase the impact. (this isnt a definite 'do it do it its better' btw. it could be that this softer look all round is far better for your tone, i just think its worth trying to see what you prefer)\nalso, i think you should do backgrounds for more panels. like this onebecause its fairly big, and right after a panel that also doesnt have a background, it looks a little bit odd. you could frame her / her thought caption in a window, maybe. have the rooms walls in a dark pink, and the view in a light orange. something simplistic like that wouldnt take away from the character, but would maintain the sense of place.\nyour villain(?) designs are clever, taking away key details like the pupils and noses and generally making them a little less human, and more reminiscent of 'bad' ghosts in pop culture. its effective at making them look sinister, while also cool. im personally hesitant about the decision to make your first poc a villain, but  since the comics in early days and i know nothing about these characters im definitely not finger wagging. the other villains design is really good though, with the spiky line language that contrasts really sharply with petunias soft curly design.\ni say this next bit mostly bc i say it to everyone, look into the concept of gesture / motion to see how it can improve the alive-ness of your work. its an area of weakness for most people, and it will really open your eyes and put your pages on the next level. proko has some brilliant videos on gesture on youtube. speaking of fundamentals, id say your anatomy and form are good, for the cartoony style you have, although its always worth looking more into form for similar reasons as gesture.\nalso, with your lettering, you might find youll have a far easier time fitting stuff in if you put your text into diamond shapes. eg:becomes(ignore the font) which takes up less space and fits a text box easier.another example:becomesbecomes\nill finish this critique by saying i really like your concept, and im very very interested to see where you go from here."", ""I guess we are posting the critiques here then  Here's mine: \nThis is a fun read. I was intriqued and drawn in from the first page, setting up that she is dead and starting to forget. It gives a sense of mystery early on and makes you that more interested in who she was, and how she died, well done! \nThe flow of the story continues to be fluent, being a very effortless read. The only place I think it felt off was the transition on page 1-4 where she decides to follow the cat. Her facial expression in the secound panel doesn't feel that convincing to me. She's clearly nervous about going outside, but her expression here seems too cheerful about it. Could be you were going for nervous smile, but it came across to me as too carefree considering what was earlier established. But I feel it is a nitpick. \nYou art is very sweet and have a nice ethereal, hazy feel to it complimenting the setting you have set with it being a ghost world. Lovely colours, and lighting. Perspective wise I feel there is something to work with; were Petunia walks down the road on page 1-4, she doesn't seem so well integrated in the scene. I get a bit of the same feeling on page 2-3 where she is sitting on the bed. I guess it also has something to do with her being a ghost. That may make it a bit problematic. It feels like a very innocent story, and these flaws adds to that feel, like you see in children's books. \nAbout the speech bubbles, they could be a tad smaller, but I didn't notice until you pointed it out in a comment. \nThe design of the characters are lovely! I alread love Nana, and the purple ghosts are cool, especially the one where you can see the skeleton inside. I thing you can improve on the faces though. Their expressions are good, but I think you can push them a bit more. They are a bit stiff, especially Petunia's. \nAll in all this has a lot going for it, I'd like to see were this is going!"", ""Yondoloki- thank you so much!! Ah and sorry for the late reply..that was kind of a bad timing on my part, I had work all day today and for some reason it doesn't let me use the forum here on my phone. Eh. Anyway! Thanks, you gave me a lot to think about. I'll definitely try to make her more expressive. And perspective, yeah..I want Petunia to still interact with objects like beds but at the same time I kinda don't, so it's like..in some weird in-between. Maybe I should just have her float more, haha.\nAnyway! The Changeling's Sister...very cool. The prologue was terrifying! What is that demon thing?! And what did it do to that poor baby?! Oh man. I absolutely love their dresses, so pretty!! \nI suppose on the critique end I don't have too much to say..nitpicky things perhaps? There are a few comics where I thought the background was pretty lacking, where they're just at the wall. Maybe more interesting angles would have helped or just pushing the camera back for some full body shots. There are a lot of half body shots! That's something to play around with..though I see you do push that more when they're outside. Rose looks so sweet and innocent all the time..something I want for my own character, haha. I love it! Definitely looking forward to reading more.  Her sister is so scary!"", 'Punkarsenic: Ah thank you, yes, I was really unsure how to do the speech bubbles! They felt off to me, I used to hand write everything so this is new territory for me! That\'s very helpful. Lots of good tips there! I\'ll definitely try to put more contrast in as well. And gesture, yeah..that\'s kind of a weak point of mine, eep! I\'ll work on it. And just because the 2 new people LOOK bad doesn\'t mean they are villains.  I want a lot of the characters to be like ambiguous. But you couldn\'t know that yet! \nWow well right off the bat I\'m definitely in love with your art style! Simple yet very effective character designs, yesssss. Your way of writing feels a lot like poetry. It\'s very pleasant! And the drawings make complete sense...it really feels like a cave. What program do you use to draw? The ""she\'s got a face like the sun"" panel really stands out and is so beautiful.._ So far I have nothing negative to say, writing this as I read!\nMan I feel bad, I seriously don\'t have much to say...and you left such a nice critique!! Hmm..I guess I would like to see more of the environments? Like the cave must look really cool..with the waterfall and all. And I did feel confused at times but then you recapped it which was pretty helpful! Recaps are great. Did Rebecca Sugar steal your design? Lars looks like your main girl now  (if you\'ve seen Steven Universe, heh..I\'m a huge fan of that show) Ooh, the last few pages have some really lovely colors! Well anyway I feel like I skimmed that a bit too much, I\'m going to read it more thoroughly..and I\'ll definitely be keeping up to date with it! Thank you so much for the critique!', ""I liked it!

Something however, for me I kind of felt like it was kind of thrown in there just to throw them in there.

The only critique I have, and it\'s VERY minor, is every so often your word bubbles just seem slightly too small for the words, such as on page 13, the middle right panel, ""Town"" comes a little too close to the edge of the bubble. But I only noticed this like 3 times, just something to keep in mind moving forward. The font you chose I think works really well with the world you built. Usually I\'m not a huge fan of text in comics that don\'t use all capital letters, as often times letters going below the baseline will interfere with the text below it, but your\'s doesn\'t at all.

You put in some very difficult poses/perspective/forshortening and it all looks great. Production is top notch.\nYour story, although very new, is so far very hard to follow.

This is all with the text/dialogue. Your visual story telling is great. Everything flows from panel to panel\nSo you only have 3 pages up, so this may all go away, and you might be trying to jar people at the beginning, I am not sure. I am not even sure who I am rooting for, and if there is a good guy/bad guy.\nAlso, your description of the comic is very confusing. Someone may click on to see if they are even remotely interested, but your description tells them nothing.\nYou might see if someone can help you script this.

I had fun making these (but my eyes are painful these days and I can't work on my tiny tiny tiny little drawings for the main story... so I grabbed charcoals and a 'normal' size of paper this time xD), so I hope you will like it too !

","['The texture is really distracting. Generally texture on digital coloring should be doing one of two things: 1. Imitating the texture of the thing represented, such as making hair look like hair etc or 2. imitating a traditional art process, such as making something look printed or painted. \nThe texture you\'re using feels the same on the characters and the background... so it kind of makes it hard to focus on anything and differentiate textures on objects. It also doesn\'t really add to the images because it\'s not representing textures such as stone or fabric. \nIf you\'re just looking to add some visual interest to your digital colors I feel like you could take a paper texture and overlay it. I made a little sample dude to show what I mean:\ntexturesample.jpg1900x900 664 KB\n\nOn the two that say ""Texture"" I just grabbed a paper texture off of google image search, set it on a ""multiply"" layer and adjusted the brightness/contrast until it had the desired effect. \nI hope that helps.', ""I agree that the effects (textures, transparency) are distracting.

They also have a lot of nice tips on the site. I see a lot of repetition of the same layout throughout. Face from front, face from profile, face from 3/4...

I'm opening up a review section on my website28 called Sekhmet's drunk and sober reviews and I am accepting requests! I am planning on writing a review every two weeks, on Fridays (originally, Tuesdays), starting on 6 December, 2016. If you are expecting a regular review, think again! It will be Sekhmet, one of the main characters of my comic, The Green-Eyed Sniper3, to give you a review  For those who are not familiar with her, here she is:

Infected_Blood_Patreon_res.jpg600x763 175 KB
 
Scared? You should be! Nah, just kidding  Here are the rules - make sure you read and understand all of them before signing up.

First come, first serve
Sign up by replying to this message
I will let you know when your review is up right on this thread
All comics accepted, regardless of artistic/writing skills, SFW/NSFW, genre, B&W/color, subject matter, etc.
Let me know if you would like me to link to your comic on Tapastic and/or elsewhere. If you don't provide any indication, I will just link to Tapastic

All comics MUST have a profile on TopWebComics at http://www.topwebcomics.com/8 Please, send me the link to your profile along with your request or Sekhmet will not give you a review! If you don't have a profile there, please create it beforehand and send me the link. I will add the link to my reviews - it's a good way to get more visibility and votes on TopWebComics (there's a related monthly ongoing thread for helping each other out on TopWebcomics, look it up in the forum)!
Sekhmet will read up to 100 pages, starting from your first page. If your comic is longer than that, and you would like to have feedback on later pages, just give a selection of the pages you would like her to read. Once again, NO MORE than 100 total
Your comic must be at least 5 pages long. Please, wait until you have enough pages before sending your request. 5 pages are little, but they are very good for artists/authors who want feedback on how they started their comics
Sekhmet will talk about your art, but since she loves storytelling, her main focus will be your writing
If there is something specific you would like Sekhmet to look at, by all means go ahead and say so
At times (more than I'd like to admit), Sekhmet gets drunk: her drunk reviews are snappier, but also more fun. Therefore... When you submit your comic, you will run the risk of getting a drunk review!
If you are afraid to get your feelings hurt, please do not ask for a review: Sekhmet is very blunt and honest. She is really trying to help you, but she'll tell you like she sees it, even when she's sober
If you wish to comment on your review, please go ahead and comment directly there. Comments sent to me elsewhere will not be shared on my website, although I will definitely read them

Ready? Go get your sober/drunk reviews from Sekhmet! 
Top Web Comics is now featuring every single review for Sekhmet Reviews in their Facebook page! Check out the intro post! Yahoo!!!

604,My Characters will talk about YOUR comic! [AKA will review your comic],Reviews | Feedback,[],"Want a FUN way to get a critique? Why not have characters from my webcomic19 critique your webcomic and talk about it? Critiques will be up around every weekend.
Basically you choose 1-2 characters from my webcomic (Two is more recomended tho) and I shall critique your comic with their voices.
Rules:1. I will only read 50 pages, so pick your pages to critique.2. Nudiity/Language/Violence NSFW is okay, as long as it doesn't have explicit sex scenes3. Will be randomly picked.4. Will do these as long as I am capable.5. Critique is up once a week
From the nicest to worst:
1Drake is very nice, he'll praise you and drop you gently and lies outta his ass about your bad side because he's a flirt. You can pick him if the other guy is roasting you. Will focus more on superficial stuff like site design, availability and general art.Ryu is easy to please by pretty art, and likes to gush. He's the perspective of a casual webcomic reader / general public.2Miki is well balanced and will focus more in more detailed way like story and characters. She's stern but very constructive. AKA azure's usual critique style.1Mike reads comics in a daily basis, so she has more perspective. Speaks foul language because she doesn't know how to be nice, but does not mean you any harm. Focuses on enjoyability and pokes at visible plot holes.Gerald is like Joe Bastianisch except very sarcastic. It's all right you don't mind getting roasted verbally though. Will poke on everything.","[""Okay, this is the coolest concept for comic review.

605,“The Human Mind”: Newly released prologue!,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Howdy!
So, I finally got the time to completely erase all content from my prologue, which I had written about 2 years ago (?), and rewrite it totally from scratch! It was good, but there's always room for improvement. There's only one way forth in life: To be better than yourself! … that is, your previous self. Always strive towards being, in your own opinion, great!
Now, down to business. My novel is called ""The Human Mind"" and it's one of three in an upcoming trilogy about reality and what it means to be a human being. I'm not sure whether to say too much about the prologue or just let you read it? It wasn't designed to make a hole lot of sense just in the beginning anyways, but to still hint about what it might be.

Excerpt from “The Human Mind”:

Prologue: When Time Breaks Down
You’re sitting by a table, outside, finding yourself at a café. The coffee is still fresh and hot. What do you do?Read more…

Give it a read and let me know what you think! 
Also, as proposed in my latest journal: Should I add my thoughts of inspiration? Or would you, the readers, prefer to guess the deeper meaning yourselves until further explanation in future chapters? I could still add some description with some thoughts of ""Why am I writing this?"", but without spoiling anything if that would be nice. It's up to you guys.

607,Could I have critique for my 1st chapter?,Reviews | Feedback,[]," I finished rewriting/drawing my first chapter27 (26 pages) of Fallacy and I'd love to hear what all is wrong (or right) with it before I plunge ahead to the next one. Probably the biggest thing I'd like to hear thoughts about is the pacing (and the writing in general). It was originally rather bad and unnecessarily slow so I hope things are moving forward now? 
But seriously, anything at all that comes to your mind will be appreciated whether it's about the writing, art, lettering...
Thank you in advance!","[""Just gave the chapter a read. It was engaging enough to draw me along, and the only thing the overall chapter was lacking for me was a little more context. Tue dialogue is mostly natural throughout and the pacing is good.\nThe weakest things I noticed were that your backgrounds are very barren leading to the settings we've seen so far not feeling like actual places but instead just solid green/brown backdrops. Aside from that, your faces are very similar across the board. I counted maybe three unique expressions across the chapter but most characters are locked into this slightly upset look. Expressions and variety of them lead to your characters being individuals. As of right now the only character with anything resembling a personality (again this is just going on the first chapter) is the redhead who stopped them on the road.\nAll in all I enjoyed it. Hopefully the shapeshifter will provide some coolVisual effects."", 'I\'m so sorry how long it took me to get back to you! I haven\'t had the opportunity/time to be online lately. ^^\' Thank you so much for responding and for the critique!\nLack of context at the start is something I was a bit worried but in the end I decided that it would be best for the story for the info to come naturally through the story itself. There\'s no ""outsider"" character who\'s not in the know about the world itself so there\'s no reason for anyone to explain how most things work. And the plot questions themselves will obviously be answered as the story continues. But I\'m glad it was still engaging and didn\'t put you off. \nI really do need to work on my backgrounds. While they aren\'t empty spaces they also aren\'t as lively as they should. That\'s something I\'ll be paying more attention! Heh, while I\'m pretty sure there are more than 3 different expressions it is true that most of this chapter people keep having mostly negative emotions displayed on their faces. I\'ll do my best to exaggerate the differences more in the future for livelier feeling.\nThank you again for your critique!

I hope you guys could review my first pages and give me some pointers.

Yeah, I will have to work on my expressions. I am a bit too fond of the stoic facial expression. Each character has a strong personality already figured out, however, I'll need to bring those details out in the expressions. Again thanks for that note, its very helpful!

609,I just finished my first chapter! Feedback would be awesome,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey guys!
I just recently finished the last page of the first chapter of The Totally Exciting Events of Jim's Day43 and it would be so cool if you guys tell me what you think about it, like honest opinions and other criticisms in order for me to fix it and improve 
As compensation and thanks, I'll also check your stuff out if you link it afterwards, but only if you give a decent feedback, not just a short ""It looks nice"" kind of thing ^^"" 
Anyways, thanks guys, and if you like it, please subscribe for more!  ","[""Ok, so this review might be a bit biased, cause i am 1 of your subs and really enjoy your series so far, but i try to go at it as objective as possible...\nCharacters: I really like your Characters and their design so far. On the first few pages i feel like there were some inconsistency's in Cheshire proportions, but you got better as your series continued, so no problem there. Both Jim and Cheshire look interesting, are easy to recognize and seem to have interesting and unique personalities so far. Your Background cast is cool too, so no problems there on my end.\nPlot: I like, that you start with this small actionsequence. Kicks the reader right into action. Leaves also a lot of questions for a reader to stay interested. You start out with lots of text thou... it might be subjective, but i generally like it more when comics start with less dialogue, so the reader can get into the comic via images not via words... this gets much, much better as you go on (especially when we get introduced to Jim and his Roommate you have some amazing panels) so i think it was a wasted opportunity to show your great skill as a writer. Your humor and how casually you bring it into your scenes is a big + point for me. It never feels forced , isn't overused, goes well with your panelstructure and story and has a unique and refreshing style to it.\nArt: Im always very carefull when it comes to tipps on artstyles that are so completely different than mine... but i have the feeling that you have the most room to improve in this category.Its difficult to tell you how exactly you can improve your art, without influencing your current style. Your lineart itself looks good and interesting, colors are decent (even thou i think you can fine tune them a bit more), my problem is that the art feels... unimpactfull in a lot of cases.What i think your art is lacking is 'interesting detail', they lack this kind of 'unique' vibe... which is sad, because your characters have this 'vibe' to me. I'd say that they could come to life much more if they were set in a universe which looks as exiting as they look. I also don't think it would destroy your current style to add this kind of detail here and there...\nI'll take Page 14 as an example cause i feel this is the page where you have both... a really nice and a quiet boring background.In the first panel, we see the shop for the first time and (sorry to say that, but)it looks insanely plain. Like any kind of 24h shop could look... now you might say that this is intentional, because those shops are supposed to look similar, but don't forget that your writing a fictional story here and should give your readers something to look at. Now we go inside the shop and have sandy sitting in front of an really interesting shelf, full of quirky stuff, has a box of snacks on his desk and reads a paper. This shot looks so much more interesting and tells me much, much more about that little 24h shop than 20 of those first shots could. And it still goes well with your style! I hope you get what i'm trying to say here... try to fill your world with interesting stuff and locations. Put more thoughts in your backgrounds. Let your city look like a place where people actually would want to live in...\nHope you don't let that last part get to you to much. Like i said, i really love your series and i think it is amazing, but since you asked, i tried to give some tipps how to improve even further.I'm really looking forward to Chapter 2 and wish the best for you and your series!\nlittleBobler \nP.S. i didn't had the strenghts left to reread what i wrote there, cause i am writing for about an hour now  If there is something confusing, or i wrote something wrong im sorry"", ""I'm new to this whole webcomic thing so just note that I am no expert xD. However, yours is actually the first comic I saw on tapastic before I even joined. \nPositive: Your art style is unique and you're really good at using color to bring your scenes to life. I also like your paneling, very easy to follow. The story is believable and your characters seem like interesting people  and I really love that computerized effect in the earlier pages, I don't think I've ever seen that in a comic (although there are many I haven't read).\nNot so positive: In some panels the backgrounds do look a little lacking in detail or rushed (Can't bash you for that though since I'm no better xD) Some of the panels have quite a few word balloons and the way they're placed made me a bit confused on how to read them at first. However, the sentence structure made the order clear after reading.\nTo be honest though after skimming some of your pages the first time (and some others) I began to wonder if my work would make an impact at all lol. However I finally got the courage to post, just to see if people would like it. My comic is called Villainz (if you're interested) and it's Sci-Fi/Action.

Pallet, saturation, contrast? :U \nIt might help to adjust colors to your surroundings more. Or to create catchy lightsituations and shading from time to time... \nTried myself in an example... hope its ok that i took 1 of your panels...\nI had the feeling that in the original panel this whole scene could have played in the afternoon and it still would have looked the same. I tried to rework it in an minimalistic way added some contrasts and shades etc... I think this brings the panel to life much more and it didnt took an insane amount of time t.b.h.

The way the word balloon trail curved upwards lol (I'm used to them going down). Either way I could read it  so that counts for a lot.

Anyway, have fun reading \\o/ and if there's anything you think I can improve on, don't hesitate to say."", 'I just finished your comic and so far, I like it because it reminds me of a 90\'s anime of sorts, like a romcom. The only thing missing there is the cheesy love triangle/reverse harem of sorts xD (jk jk) other than that, the story is good, I see what you\'re trying to do, but the relic\'s back story is a bit confusing in the sense that the ""accidental"" killing of the king\'s uncle was added, why would he intentionally kill the heir? I mean, would there be a reason for the ""accidental"" part?\nArt wise, I don\'t think you need the color, it would be so nice if you experimented with screentone more to emulate traditional manga rather than gradients as the lack authenticity tends to strip the charm away from the story. Anatomy-wise, there\'s a lot to fix, mostly on the profiles and proportions. I suggest going through some tutorials on youtube, study up on manga proportions and looking into real life. I mean, it looks ok, but it can be so much more, I see so much potential with it, just needs a few clean ups here and there \nIn terms of speech bubbles, Japanese is written from top to bottom in manga I believe, hence why the bubble themselves are horizontal, not vertical. Try to experiment with this \nAnyways, the last thing is this page:The transition between the 2 events isn\'t clear enough and would work so much better as 2-3 more pages of sorts.

After that he realized he could accomplish almost anything with it. (now that I'm typing this I realize I should've put this in there xD but time was against me).\nThe art x.x. Well, as for the screentones I'm still trying to figure out how to add them without creating that awful moire effect. Haven't had any luck even after trying suggestions I found on other sites (add blurs, resize after toning). I'm not sure if it's the program I use - Clip studio paint and Medibang paint seem to both have that issue. If there's anything you could suggest I'd definitely try it   I don't want the anatomy to look like normal human anatomy, but more like some of the uniquely drawn characters I've seen (example, Sailor Moon women with really long legs, One piece with the big hands and plain eyes, stuff like that). Some parts definitely weren't drawn the way they ought to be, that I understand :/ . There's lot's of different styles of manga and I'm not sure mine would really be called manga in a professional sense but I'll try to see what I can learn as I go  \nThat last page did need a better transition, most definitely xD but I'm glad you liked it at least somewhat.""]",4/13/2017 13:01,https://forums.tapas.io/t/i-just-finished-my-first-chapter-feedback-would-be-awesome/17679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
610,Your voice is greatly desired,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello, I need to ask a BIG favour. I would love some reviews/feedback on my comic. I know that's all everybody on here wants but I'd really like to know what works for some people and what doesn't. 
I'm not asking from reams upon reams of feedback. Anything you want no matter how short. It can be about the art of the writing. Help a fellow creative weirdo out, you never know, you might even like the series. Below is a small synopsis. Thank you. 
Synopsis:If you've got an issue you hire B.O.O.M.Jack, Reg and Iswell are at your service. A group of highly chaotic problem-solvers that'll get the job done one way or another... no matter how hard you plead them to stop.
B.O.O.M. (Band of Outrageous Misfits)33","['Salutatioins! Well, I read through your whole first issue and I\'ve got some things that might help you in future!\nI\'ll start with the art: You\'ve got a good start here in terms of general composition. The only problem I\'m having is I can\'t always tell what\'s going on in each frame. I can tell you that, this is directly due to a lack of shading. I can\'t tell foreground from background in some instances and I can\'t tell objects apart (Reg was sitting in a baby pool in one frame and that is a GREAT visual gag and I totally missed it the first time I saw the page). I\'d suggest starting with a grey scale and see how you feel about it. Adding different textures also, will help the foreground pop. So that\'s how I\'d start. One example of this that might help is Mike Mignola. He\'s the artist for Hellboy and he works primarily in black and white1 or sparse simple colors1. I think you\'ve got a good style in the making and a little bit of shading might make it really pop.\nWriting: The writing has some good moments. I love the exchanges between Reg and Iswell, (and the gag that is Iswell\'s name) they\'ve got some good chemistry going and a believable relationship so far. The scenes are pretty dialogue heavy which isn\'t always a bad thing but, there\'s a lot of telling instead of showing that happens. For instance, the Milk Thief. I think this could\'ve come across better if there was a physical representation of this happening before Jack brought it up. For instance: Instead of  Jack mentioning to the Catburgler that milk is being stolen out of the fridge, introduce the audience to the joke visually. Have a note pinned to the fridge asking ""Who took the milk"" or something along those lines so that we\'ve got a subtle hint about it. It reduces dialogue and you can make your exchanges more succinct. Here is some hints on dialogue in comics that I\'ve found useful1.\nEstablishing shots: This one will really help your audience feel the atmosphere. In the segment where Jack, Reg, and Iswell are getting on the boat I actually had no idea they were on a boat, or even a dock. An establishing shot would tell me where we were and give me context. So instead of showing them running across the dock first, instead show a shot of the docks like these show their respective scenes,2 and it could really open up the atmosphere of the story.\nI hope this stuff was helpful. I think you\'ve got a great concept going on with your story and I wish you all the best!', ""Wow! This is really really helpful. So much constructive criticism and links to help improve my work. Thank you for taking the time to read my work. I'll start applying these things to my next issue and future issues. Thanks again for your comments, really really helpful.  "", ""Being a writer, not an artist, I can't offer practical advice regarding your art but I can tell you that, as a reader, it's on the rough and rudimentary side for my tastes. It certainly has potential though, the basic composition is clear enough and with some refinement of style it could reach the level of your story premise - THAT's what I find appealing about BOOM. It's a strong, wacky premise and the dialogue feels quite natural. I'm curious to see where it's heading."", ""I'm personally not very good at reviewing but I do know one thing that could improve. I think you should be a little more generous with your font size. It wasn't  like I couldn't read what was written but it would make it easier and more comfortable to read.\nI really hope this helps a little!(sorry for any spelling errors English isn't my main language)"", ""Hey no problem. I'm so glad I was able to help! "", ""@trinkettrancemusic Thank you for the kind words. When you say 'refinement of style' would mind giving me an example? Thanks.  \n@Konako Thank you. This does help, I'm open to any little bit of constructive criticism. In this case, this does help a lot. I can see what you mean, so for future issues, I've upped the font.  \n@SynCypher I've already started to implement these in my future issues. "", ""Ah, cool! Can't wait to check out your next updates! "", ""I guess I mean continuing on the path of making the art whatever you think it needs to be to tell your story best, whether that's increased focus on traditional texturing and draftsmanship or embracing something more abstract, surreal or otherwise stylized. Whatever that spark is it needs to find its form. There's a chance some of that made sense.

611,Advice on my Comic?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello all! I've been working on a comic for a little while now, not a very long time. I finally feel like I've reached the minimum pages to ask for feedback/advice. I'm not at all experienced in comic layouts, storytelling, etc. So this comic to me is kind of like a learning curve type thing. I intend for this story to be a learning experience, and not something to rely on for money, readership, etc, but I think it would be very helpful to ask for advice so I can continue improving. 
I've been trying to settle into a style so things are a bit inconsistent from page to page and I'd really like to hear thoughts about what you think I've done well in certain pages, badly in others, and so on. Thanks so much!
Our Ongoing Story19","[""Hey laurenstrawn!\ngood idea to get stuck into a comic as a way to learn - the best way to learn how to do something is by doing it. on that note, never let yourself get trapped in a decision you made in this comic you grow out of - change designs and styles as much as you want to find what works for you.\ni really like the concept - we dont have enough comics abt lesbians (bi women? idk) on tapas, and witches are always dope.\nlooking at your art:your colours look nice, but i think you could do with playing around with colour more to match the tone. for example, this:would be better if you faded from the pink to a dark blue or black background, with the panel far darker, cooler, and less saturated. something like...thisa change in colour like that is a good way of indicating a change of setting, and can also say a lot about the scene. colour is reeeeally useful in story telling.\nas another example, you could make 'this dance we do' less saturated, and darker, to indicate that its a grim situation, being enacted by a character who's very upset with their life. you should also change the colours for the exchange between the girls and the boys monologue, to make it clearer theyre two different settings.\nid recommend looking into colour theory - theres some good tutorials on deviantart and tumblr if you look around.\nalso, as you probably already know, you need to keep working on the fundamentals. not just anatomy, but also gesture and form (and composition but idrk how to give u feedback on that. look at cinematography for some good pointers on how to compose comic panels tho. this was an helpful analysis for me)when it comes to resources on brushing up on fundamentals - people-drawing, wise - my go-to recc is Proko on youtube. he has videos on figure drawing (which you absolutely should do, drawing from life is the best way to get better at drawing anything in any style) as well as illustration and caricature - i think hes an illustrator by trade, so thats cool.i made a thread a while ago that has a lot of helpful resources for the fundamentals in the responses, check that out too\ndunno where exactly to slot this in, butthis is a nice very nice hand, with good shading. shading like this throughout your comic would look good - the coloured lines are a nice touch too.\nyour backgrounds could do with being more detailed, to help with creating a sense of place. id recommend making models of recurring or important sets using model software like google sketchup (free, easy to use) or blender (free, more versatile, steep learning curve but good tutorials on youtube). thatd also help with the depth element. otherwise, think of your backgrounds as a set that your characters, like actors, are moving around - someone has built this set, and its a little worn, its full of stuff appropriate to the scene; your characters live there, they leave stuff around. a more interesting set gives your characters more to do gives you more interesting poses to draw.\nlooking at your writing:\nim afraid im going to seem mean here, ie no compliment sandwiches - although as i mentioned before, this is a cool concept. i also like the anticapitalist vibes forming.\nyoure going too fast.\nyour main characters meeting is exactly 2 panels. when they next interact theyre texting like good friends, and the Problem of the story is already being introduced. instead, you should slow down, introduce each character enough for the reader to care about them - what happens after they meet, and find out theyre both witches? does pink invite flowercrown out for a drink, do they talk about witchcraft, being gay, rumours about shops closing down (foreshadowing) - maybe moan about this company thats closing them? are they romantic interests? are they just friends? how does flowercrown get pinks number?\nif you think your readers are getting bored (theyre not, these gay girls are super cute) you can spatter this cute buildup with more 'meanwhile' scenes; show mysterious shots of the boy doing his depressing work, of this boss's devious scheming. maybe the boss shouts at the boy, who's upset all the way back to his studio. he calms down, and begins teaching a buncha children how to dance - this shows the audience a hint of what this boys motivations are, instead of him telling us upright. dont tell us that. leave it, until its pried out of him by one of the girls.\na big thing with comics is the act of showing, not telling - you have all these images to tell people more than the words alone do. id recommend practicing making short, wordless comics, that tell a story.\nthe other stuff (ie lettering and panelling and all that crap):\nyou moved recently to this kind of letteringhonestly, id say the coloured, borderless bubbles looked better in your comic, but regardless heres some tips:\nwhen making the bubble for your words, you want to leave an even space around it - so no letters are touching the side and they all come to the same distance. a standard rule is you should be able to move a lowercase 'o' through the space between the letters and edge of the bubble.\nthis is made easier by structuring your lettering in a diamond shape - this setup takes up the least space for your bubble. dont cut off words for this a laelemen-tarybut instead change how you break up the lettering to accommodate long words.so your lettering would look like this:\nid also recommend getting a free, more comic-friendly font from blambot or somewhere similar. times new roman, and other default office fonts, really dont work. you want something rounder and bouncier, especially for a comic like this\nas for panelling, youre generally fine - borderless panels, like borderless bubbles, suit your comic. you could definitely do to be more creative with your panelling; the zig-zag panels looked cool, what if you put them on a slant too? stuff like that can add drama to a scene.\nalso bear in mind that on tapastic, you have the benefit on infinite scroll. if you want to slow a scene down, make your panels bigger and further apart. if you want to speed it up, bring them closer together.\ni know this is a lot of 'do this better' 'do that better' but try not to get disheartened - each and everyone one of us has been where you are now, and its brilliant that youre reaching out for feedback and looking to improve your work. keep working at it, and youll improve and improve until youre brilliant.\nalso, if youre cool with books and buying them (or ordering them from a local library) these are some good ones a lecturer on comics recommended to me:\n\nscott mccloud: understanding comics\n\nditto, making comics\n\nditto, reinventing comics\n\nwill eisner, comics & sequential art\n\nditto, graphic storytelling & visual narrative\n\n"", ""Oh wow! Thank you so much for your detailed feedback, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it! I'm glad you like the concept, and I'm hoping to do better with pacing, especially the spacing between panels. I really want to shake it up in that respect but finding the courage to do so is a little daunting!\nThe hand- it took so long but it was totally worth it haha.\nYou're definitely right about pacing and I hadn't realized how much I was struggling with this until you pointed it out, so thank you! Now that I'm aware, I'll try to add more cute, character building fluff! I do want to flesh out the girls a lot more. I actually have a whole chapter planned to flesh out the villan, actually! But that won't be for awhile.\nI absolutely need to work more on the dialog, and figuring out fonts etc, so I'll be experimenting with that in upcoming pages!\nI'll see if my local library has any of those books, because I think they'd all be a great read. I can't thank you enough for your help!"", ""i wouldnt say with pacing you should just add more fluff - although fluff is always good imo and filler and char dev are very useful - but generally let things build up and emerge to the readers naturally, instead of cutting through to the basic points needed to gather the plot. you want to lay out the puzzle pieces - or some of them - before putting them together. so, instead of the boy instantly telling pink he hates his job and the paperwork is forged etc, maybe he should be like 'hey, dont shoot the messenger. i know it sucks but you gotta do what you gotta do' and be really forlorn, apologetic. the truth comes out abt the forgery when the girls track him down and goad it out of him, after - through worldbuilding guised as research - they discover that magic shops are closing left right and centre, and its a serious problem for a lot of people.\nidk if im explaining this very helpfully, but essentially its the concept of showing, rather than telling.\nalso im glad my feedback is helpful! good luck with your comic!"", ""Thanks again! I made another page2 keeping in mind a lot of what you said, so if you have the time I'd love to hear if you think I did a better job keeping those things in the forefront! I really appreciate that you took the time out of your day to help me, so thank you!"", 'I was about to comment on this post, but you really got it down. Not only that, but you made me feel better about my own doubts on my comic. I recently thought that maybe the pace of my story was too slow, but I have so many important characters, going faster people might not get to know them well enough or understand the relationship between all of them and the added elements of the story as it builds up to the brewing trouble ahead. So, thank you. A slow build up is not a bad thing. Thank goodness.', 'this is a lot better! its clear in your panelling youve thought abt pacing, your backgrounds show more thought, and were starting to get more of the characters.\nid recommend making your characters more expressive, to show their reactions to things. how is flowercrown feeling when pink turns up with this boy? her expression is pretty blank, could it instead be curious, or worried?']",4/22/2017 15:52,https://forums.tapas.io/t/advice-on-my-comic/17876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

615,Can you please give me feedback on my prologue?,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Howdy, I just finished my prologue for Infected Blood and I'm looking for feedback:
https://tapastic.com/series/Infected-Blood22
It's only 5 pages long. Here's what I'd like to hear about (feel free to answer as many or as few questions as you like): is it powerful? Is it clear? Does it make you curious about the rest of the story? What's working and what's not? And what about the colors (these are pretty much the first pages I've ever made in color!), do you think they fit the mood? Anything else you'd like to point out?
Thanks for any and all feedback!","['I haven\'t read the summary on purpose, since you\'re asking for review on the prologue only.\nIt doesn\'t really strike me as ""powerful"", as in emotional etc, purely because there\'s very standard adventure dialogue (I.E \'hold on\' or \' just go!\') and just a couple of shots of different characters who I don\'t know and therefore do not care about. It\'s all very abstract, which I think was your point, but there wasn\'t really anything unique about it, just a run-of-the-mill start to sci-fi(?) adventure. I had trouble figuring out what was happening (I still don\'t get it. Egyptian aliens is the only thing I gained from it? ) because of the confusing paneling & camera angles. It\'s good that you\'re going for different angles & perspective shots but I felt like with such a short prologue they just made it more confusing. The mood is dark & gritty so I think you did a good job on that. The colours are very standard western comic colours(--flat), so there\'s not that much to say about them. Some of the backgrounds had weird colour gradients that were just ugly colour combinations to me, but that\'s more a personal preference.\nThe anatomy is more or less okay except in the hands and faces. IMHO you should practice those more, since they stick out consistently when compared to the rest. The expressions are also off, especially the latest torso & up shot of the main character(?), in the same manner that ME: Andromeda facial animations are off. I can\'t honestly tell where you were going with that particular expression, I\'m guessing either \'sexy\' or \'hurt\' but it kind of looks like she\'s singing more than anything. Try to google references, or just go pull faces in front of a mirror to help out with making the expressions more real.', ""Thanks a lot, that was very helpful! I mostly welcome the point of view of people like you, who didn't read my previous comic, so don't know anything about the main character who's hurting herself (with off anatomy :)).

I like the reviewing idea though.\nPunkarsenic should I review There Was a War? Apologies in advance because I'm terrible at giving feedback.\nI've reviewed it very quickly and I do like your artstyle. I thought the 'Lord of the Rings/Elfish' font in the first page is a bit though to read, although I do understand why you chose it. I really love your use of colours, they really give your comic personality, as well as make the 'world' they're in look bigger. Great ambience setter. It might also be fun to experiment with colours to channel emotions, but I'll leave that up to you.\nI hope my feedback is useful to you.\nHere is the link to my own comic.https://tapastic.com/series/Far-off-the-Mark4"", 'And hum I guess mine for review would be NSE3 since everything else is a 5-10 page short story, but I\'d like to lead into that that the first two chapters were completed between 2010-2015, so ch1 is actually going to elementary school now lmao.\nI am reviewing @Blobsyoowhan first\nFar off the Mark \nI\'ll start this off by saying I\'m not usually very big on gag-a-day type of comics. But I did like FOTM quite a bit. I read through all the 14 present episodes, and there were only a few I didn\'t think worked (fart & pokemon joke to be exact). The artstyle is pleasant to look at, and I have no trouble telling where everyone is supposed to be or what they are supposed to be etc. I actually giggled at both the lion king references, but my favourite joke by far was the river styx strip, I thought that was very clever, and the art was also much more detailed than on the other strips. It\'s a little bit early to say yet, but I feel like you would benefit from a storyline behind the gags, since I feel like pop coulture references will only get you so far. Think of, for example, adventure time (or, any other popular cartoon show for that matter). It can have filler-type episode with a 10-minute story arc, but sometimes it will throw in an episode that advances a plot that spans through the seasons. I feel like a structure like that would help with reader engagement, since right now it\'s kind of like when someone links you something on those meme sites and you scroll through them and think ""well that was funny"", but don\'t actually revisit on your own. Apologies if you\'re planning something like that for the future, since there\'s only the 14 strips so I\'m just reviewing what I see. Overall though, I liked it, but I felt it lacked something that\'d keep me coming for more.\n\nAnd @punkarsenic second\nThere Was a War1\nStarting this off by saying I dig the artstyle quite a bit. I feel though that you use the filter/brush texture way too much, and I actually got a  legit headache from the pastel/crayon texture. That however is just a matter of opinion/taste/migraine. You create some interesting lighting situations especially in the first few episodes, and the colour schemes were lovely. However I did not like your choices of fonts all that much, and I felt like the variation between different fonts & handwritten text was a bit too steep. I think you should either pick a font and stick with it, or do it all by hand, since your handwriting is clear enough to read. The plot is hard to judge at this point since it\'s in it\'s early steps, but I felt like in the beginning the whole ""she\'s beautiful"" bit came a little out of nowhere. I don\'t know if that was your intention, but it felt kind of random to me when I was reading. Overall most of my nitpicking is just on the technical side, and I did find the story & artstyle to be pleasant.\n', 'Oh I like these threads, I\'m just gonna save my place here as I review the comics above me.\n@punkarsenic There Was a WarFirst thing I notice is that a lot the text is in this messy font that is honestly difficult for me to read. Please don\'t use this messy font in white on a bright green background. A dark green background could be more legible.Also, unless you have a reason for it, try not to put text on character\'s faces. The face is the default center of interest in an image, it usually looks nicer if you leave some room for it.Second of all, the art style. It\'s very messy, with rough lines and loose colors and doesn\'t always work. I feel the style is hindered by many anatomical and proportional oddities, as well as a lack of depth to the characters. You already made a thread about this so just keep practicing! Honestly, the more experimental scenes were my favorite, like when you draw with white on black when Balor\'s in the cave. You do have nicely detailed backgrounds and crowd, though, which I enjoy, and you have some interesting color choices.Lastly we got story, and I probably should have started with this because this is honestly your strongest area. It\'s well paced, and the characters have clear personalities. I like that it\'s clear why Balor\'s got a crush on Cath and they have strong chemistry together, which is good if you\'re writing a romance with a tragic ending.\n@BlobsyoowhanFar off the Mark1 Well, a gag comic! The art is fine for what it is, simple and clear. Clarity is honestly more important than style in a gag-a-day, imho. I feel like the lineart gets better as it goes along, it looks cleaner and you seem to gain a better understanding of shapes and depth. As for the jokes of the comic, these are my personal favorites3. you definitely seem to get how to tell a joke, but a lot of your comics just end in ""guy makes a weird face because something random happened."" That kind of humor gets old fast. Stuff like your bottle comic is stronger, describe more weird and silly worlds to your audience! \n@anmarisinkman Not so Emo3Alrighty, first thing I notice is that the beginning meaders a lot. We gotta see this kid get dressed and walk to school, and then he\'s in class, and then he\'s in the woods about to strip for some dude, and then they\'re talking about Mulan. As I was reading I was wondering what is the point to all of this? I keep reading and only after 15 episodes do I have a decent idea of what the story is supposed to be about. Bear with me, I\'m trying these reviews and I read the comic, but if you were planning to go the romance route I feel you could have established it a lot earlier. I feel Nem and Marco\'s chemistry when they\'re in romance mode isn\'t as strong as when they\'re in brotp mode. All of a sudden Nem is talking about how music is magic when I didn\'t really get any indication of that earlier. I feel the romance could be stronger if they stuck with their relationship as just two dudes hanging out even in more romantic scenes, I think it could be interesting showing their platonic scenes accidentally drift into romantic in a more subtle way than one dude falling on the other so the dad thinks they\'re going to have sex. I stopped reading after 30 episodes because 1. this comic is long and 2. I didn\'t feel the urge to continue.Now I think the art is a lot stronger than your writing, and I skipped to the current pages to get a better idea of the current quality. Your thin lineart is very nice, and the soft shading is pretty. I honestly wish you did this comic in color because the colors in your covers look lovely. I feel you could push your values a lot more, though. You only seem to use lighter greys in your shading, hardly any dark greys or spot blacks. I feel this hinders the setting of the comic, dark scenes don\'t actually look dark, and the lighting for every scene looks the same.The characters ususally look nice and you have a good understanding of proportions and anatomy, but I feel you could make their faces a little more diverse. Oftentimes I would have to look back to previous pages to remember which character had which outfit/hairstyle just so I could differentiate them. Same face isn\'t as much of a problem if you have strongly differing character silhouettes but I feel like yours a tad too similar.\nMy comic is Household Slime Mold5, if anyone wants to give it a shot', 'I\'ve wanted to give one of these a try! It\'s going to take me a little time to get into these, so I will reserve a place here and do the reviews as I get time~ Working working working, busy busy busy~ \n\n@nessiefynn \nThese are all my first impressions! Also, if anything I say here isn\'t useful to you, feel free to disregard. I\'m biased toward certain things, and I acknowledge that. \nEstablishing shots are well-paced, and we get to some action pretty quickly, which I like. It doesn\'t take 20 pages for something to happen. Dialogue is very fluid and realistic. The art is really clean and smooth, and the lettering fits the comic style well. The backgrounds and the characters mesh well together and aren\'t at odds.\nI really like how you established the doctor-y occupation of Pen by his look and the pharmacy setting. You showed it all very visually, which I enjoyed. You\'ve got a good handle on visual storytelling.\nFor things that can be improved, I think some of the poses are a little stiff and rigid, especially some of the more action-y ones (I\'m thinking in particular the scene where Mildew is riding Violet). In animation you always hear the term ""Push the poses"" in order to get the action across more, to be more entertaining for the viewer, and I think that applies to comics too. It\'s just more entertaining (in my opinion). \nHere\'s an example of what I mean, ""exaggerating"": http://img10.deviantart.net/0825/i/2006/290/f/5/how_to_exaggerate_by_batangbatugan.jpg2\nI think your style really lends well to exaggeration, and would be cool to see what you did with it. \nStory-wise, at least in chapter one, it feels a little cookie-cutter. It\'s not bad, and it establishes characters, has good pacing, and concludes well, but it\'s a story I\'ve read many times before. I\'m a little more harsh when it comes to a story, because I went to school to study literature, so for me personally I usually want more emotional/character centric stories. But not everyone is interested in that, haha, so it\'s really up to you. That\'s my bias.\nIt feels kind of like a pilot episode of a TV show. The characters sort of have a ""wide appeal"" that you often see in stories meant for extremely broad (and generally younger) audiences. There aren\'t really ""issues"" being discussed, just characters having a good time with a little bit of a lesson thrown in. \nI also wonder about the world the characters are in. It\'s not really explained why Ramparts is a satyr-like creature of Chancel is an angel-like one; they\'re just sort of ""there"" and they exist. Which lends itself to that ""wide appeal"" thing a little I feel. It\'s similar to Adventure Time and a lot of modern cartoon shows. But for me personally, I like to see the world and why the characters exist in it, what impact they have on the world, etc. \nIn a lot of literature, you often come across this: If the character isn\'t human, they have to have a reason for not being human. Because essentially you\'re writing for humans. That\'s why you always get that one human character to contrast with. For comics like Maus and novels like Redwall or Watership Down, the authors aren\'t really discussion animal issues, they\'re discussing human issues. Animals are the vehicle they choose to use to get their idea across.\nThat\'s something that I\'m personally playing with in my own work, and it might be something cool to think about for you as well, if you haven\'t already. \nOverall though, the comic is really well done, and I could see it being part of an anthology. It lends itself to a sort of ""one-shot"" category, and the way you write is very suited to it. Which is a huge plus in comics! The characters are super distinctive and the world is interesting. You art is very clean, and it\'s obvious you\'ve put a lot of work in. I\'ve subscribed! Keep it going :)!\n\n@anmarisinkman\nThese are all my first impressions! Also, if anything I say here isn\'t useful to you, feel free to disregard. I\'m biased toward certain things, and I acknowledge that. \nSo! Really like the art style and the greyscale. You color is nice too, kinda has this nostalgic feeling. \nI read the first chapter, and then I read a few of the more recent chapters. I\'ll start with the older stuff first~ \nEarly Chapters: \nMy first impression is that it kinda meanders. I\'m not really sure what the story is about. The characters all seemed to be kinda mean, except Marcus. I think it was for the comedy effect, but I just found them a little cruel (that\'s just my bias peeking through lol, lots of people love the cruelness). I have an inkling that Nem and Marcus have a thing going, and that\'s probably what\'s going to hold the thing together, but I\'m not sure. The dialogue is sort of cumbersome, and at some points it was hard to read. It kinda felt like I was reading a novel, not really a comic. The visual beats didn\'t match the dialogue very well.\nI think in the beginning some of the characters lack a defined silhouette and have a liiiitttle bit of same-ness going on (at least with the short haired characters). I was getting Nem confused with Erica, mostly \'cause I had to look a little harder to notice the details that differentiated them. \nLater Chapters: \nThe meandering dialogue has cleaned up a lot and things are much more to the point. It moves the story along at a better pace. The characters are also more defined I feel, and you\'ve gotten better at the beats on a page (the most recent page has a ""pause"" where Nem just sighs, which is a nice pacing touch). \nThe thin lineart style works really well, and the greyscale shading with highlights is awesome.\nI feel like the characters all talk in kinda the same way? Just a little. I don\'t mean you have to go in and make someone sound like a hick from the hills, but there are often small nuances in conversation that make people ""sound"" different. For instance, someone who\'s very forceful and to the point will talk in short, clipped sentences. But someone who is wishy-washy will meander on and on and on, sidelining the point. In another way, someone with very successful parents may speak more eloquently than someone who lives in the trailer park. Both might be college students, but they would speak differently. \nOverall it feels like this is a ""practice"" project, because the difference between the first chapters and the newest are very defined. You\'ve improved a lot, and as a result it kinda throws the story off a little. Also, the later themes seem to be much more ""mature"" than the earlier chapters. The storytelling style is very different in the later pages, much more condensed. \nFor improvement, I would suggest maybe trying different angles when you\'re having a dialogue scene. The comic is very character/dialogue heavy, and the camera always seems to be at the same level no matter where the characters are. It might spice up the composition to move it around a little. \nAlso, the plot doesn\'t really feel solidified around a central point; it\'s sort of memoire-esque. My questions for you would be: What\'s your end goal for the comic? Are you intending to make it a graphic novel? Is it episodic without a defined end? Right now, I don\'t really know. It feels like it started out wanting to be a graphic novel, but the story is more ""memoire/episodic"" than a graphic novel is now. \nI think you\'re going to get really good at this though. The improvements you\'ve made since the first chapter, and the fact that you\'re looking for feedback tells me you\'re in this to win it. Your art is really good, and I can see you getting an even better handle on visual storytelling as the chapters move on. This is excellent. Keep going!  \n\n@Blobsyoowhan \nWoooo, gags! I needed a laugh, haha. \nI found all of your strips pretty funny, and you\'ve got nice comedic timing. I also like how lighthearted the jokes are. You\'re not bringing anyone down with them! \nBut because of the format and the lack of a defined character (except in the more recent strips), I think you might have some trouble getting people to stick around... the pop-culture references are nice for the moment, but I think keeping an important through-line to make your comics connect to each other is also important. And it doesn\'t have to be a single character either. Kate Beaton does Hark, a Vagrant! by using similar themes, such as history and literature, and ties them all together with her art style. \nThe art is really nice and well-suited to the genre! My suggestions for improvement here would be color, and perhaps working on line confidence. Some of the lines are sketchy (I know they are textured, but with textured lines I feel the sketchiness might be even more apparent), but that will improve with practice. There\'s also a lack of color unity, I feel. For instance, on the Monsters page, the colors appear to be chosen randomly, and as a result you get a bit of a discordant, uncomfortable feel. \nBut then, that could be intentional haha! If so, carry on! \nOverall I think you\'re going in a good direction! Really cute and fun comics. I feel like you can stick them together in a book one day if you wanted, then tour it around some conventions. If that\'s your eventual goal, haha. Keep up the good work! \n\nMy comic is still in it\'s baby stages, but you can find most of the prologue here if you wanted to take a look: www.miragecomic.com2 I so appreciate it!\nI update pages on the site ahead of the ones at Tap, so the Tap pages are behind.', '(post withdrawn by author, will be automatically deleted in 24 hours unless flagged)', ""@JuJu_Be- please read the rules in the original post.

Alright so, I've been drawing this comic for close to seven years now (in may~), but the reason I'd like a review on the third chapter is mainly because I was on a three year hiatus due to medical issues from mid point of chapter 2, so there's some jumping in art style & writing quality between the chapters. Also the first chapter was finished in 2013, so I've had plenty of time to review it myself, and there is a lot I am not happy about it (especially first 20 or so pages look horrible, and the last 20 pages have cringy & forced jokes).

623,WintreKitty Reviews,Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hello everyone! 
My name is Wintre, and I am the creator of WintreKitty Reviews. I was originally based on Inkblazers, but with the shutdown that occured at the beginning of February, I had to make a dramatic change to a new location. Tapastic isn't as welcoming to longer more complex reviews like Inkblazers was, but the community is fantastic which is why I decided to make Tapastic one of my main locations!
The purpose of WintreKitty Reviews is to help give feedback to artists who are just starting up, or who have finished a comic, etc. No matter what stage of the creative process you are in, I'm here to help! 
Unfortunately, I lost a lot of my fan base when Inkblazers shut down and now I feel like I'm starting all over. This change is made more difficult by the fact that my reviews are now available at a source outside of the comic locations. 
So this is where you come in. I am looking for comics to review! I currently have a short waiting list, and I am looking to increase that list and get a bigger audience to my blog. I try to release at least one review every two weeks (I am a full time student, so this can be tricky).  So if anyone is interested in a review, please let me know! If you are unsure, check out my other reviews on my blog, WintreKitty Reviews273.
I create these reviews for both the artists to help them get the necessary feedback, as well as for the audience. Reviews are a great way to find out whether a comic would be a good read for you! 
If there are any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! You may also be able to find the answers to whatever questions you have via the blog site. So make sure you check it out!  
I look forward to hearing from you all

So I'm pretty new to Taptastic. Started uploading an ongoing title two weeks ago and today I've decided to start a new series of short comics between 4-8 pages long.

This easily could have been something that was 'too heavy' but coming from the child's point of view made it a little more approachable and saving the grim reality to the end sort of makes you feel hopeful for the kid that things will get better thanks to his positive outlook despite his situation (which is why I subbed).

"", 'when you reply to multiple people you should use ""@username"" to avoid double-posting \nHere\'s some critique I had, being a mass-consumer of short stories myself;\nI liked it, but I thought the doctor\'s name was kind of beating the reader with a mallet with the symbolism. I get why you had it, but I think it was unnecessary. I also think the comic was a little bit too long --- The set-up was somewhat slow and made me lose interest. Again, I understand why you had the opening so long, but imho it coud\'ve used some editing. Some of the monologue was a little clumsy, especially at the start. I felt you overused the word proud in order to make the story come a full circle, when in fact it would\'ve done so even without the repeats. Overall it was pleasant, but I saw the twist coming a mile away because of the repeats & the over the top symbolism, and I think it\'d benefit you if you didn\'t look down on the reader in a sense --- People would\'ve gotten it even if you didn\'t go so out of your way to make sure everybody understood the message, and it would\'ve made the comic have a bigger emotional impact.', 'Loved it, but was not ready for the feels so early in the morning...

625,"If you have time, could you take a look at my comic?",Reviews | Feedback,[],"Hey so my comic is Harmony Monsters10. 
 It's about chakras and how special people can see this energy in the form of monsters. The story is currently at 28 pages, which could be a good length to go to print and try to sell localed and at conventions. The problem is, going to print is a big step and everything story wise is ""set in stone"" as it were when it's printed.  
I'm asking anyone who wants to to review/ give me their opinions on my comic so that I can work out any of the kinks that I've overlooked while I can. I would greatly appreciate i! Thank you.  
(P.S. if you're reading it on mobile, the prologue pages may be out of order because I tried to trick the system to pout them to the front on desktop few but they were posted chronologically in the middle. These pages are blue and green and the four of them happen at the beginning of the story) 
","['First off, I\'m just giving you my impressions as a reader. I\'m a writer, but not of comics. There\'re probably more qualified people to give you a critique. \nThat said, I really like the story concept! Out of balanced chakras/emotions taking the form of animals. That is really cool! And I already love how creative you are with the animal designs. (Love how the turtle transformed as the emotions intensified.) The concept is what drew me in; right now it\'s too early to feel much for the characters. \nOn the topic of printing (mind you I\'m kinda out of my element), I\'m not sure whether you\'re a bit too early in the game or not. Like I said before, there\'s not much story yet. A buyer would really have to fall in love with your art, because it\'s just too early and you haven\'t given us a chance to become invested in the story. Your characters and world aren\'t fleshed out enough yet.\nI\'m aware that many people sell their comics issue by issue. But though they may sell only 20-something pages in print, they usually have many more pages online that they can link back to. They sell their issue and then say, ""I have two dozen more pages of story online that you can read after."" I think it\'s nice to have more story to link the reader back to and keep them hooked. \nJust my advice. If you really want to print now go right ahead! Nobody can tell you what\'s the best approach for your comic. And I really like the concept.

626,Review for a review,Reviews | Feedback,[],I made this thread so that we can all review each other's comics....also because I've never had anyone truly review my comic before....so I'll review your comic if you review mine.👉😎👉,"['Link to my comic22', 'Hi there, I\'d be more than happy to do a review for you! Sounds like a fun idea and the most important thing in the art world is networking! I took a look at your comics and really enjoyed them. The story is interesting and starting with ""I\'m not really a cat they just draw me this way"" (not verbatim of course) really drew me in. The style and dialogue are really energetic and I feel like it could easily inspire a cartoon on tv or something. \nAs far as criticizims go, I would say perhaps going to digital and coloring it would be great, I started coloring and inking by hand and honestly feel like it\'s a lost/under appreciated art form, but in today\'s world of competitive web comics people love digitally edited work. Also if you add more as far as backgrounds it could create depth and intricacy to your panels. Again, I like your style and the simplified backgrounds are great.

Creator of Life of an Aspie7 and the tenth sub of your comic Clint the Cat (quirky little set up you got there with your story).

"", ""First off, I love that fact that the cast is all male, no offense towards female comic characters, I just really like male perspectives in certain stories. When I began the comic, all of the names were being thrown around, so I kina of got lost with who was who and what was what, but thankfully you made an insightful cast list that helped to ease the prior confusion, speaking of cast lists, they're another thing I love in comics.

Thank you for subscribing to my rather questionable comic...I'm really interested in your comic's storyline and the characters and Im ready for the next update!

I've had Dobble & Ed about 13 years and this is how it started out... Very rough, and on wide rule paper no less! So just keep doing what you love and soaking up all the tricks and techniques you can and you'll improve. As of right now I just use photoshop since I'm comfortable with it, I pencil and ink on physical paper and scan it in. My goal is to have a tablet and get around to buying a comic-specific editing software but bills come first unfortunately."", ""Ok~! I'm home and I read it! So, here's what I like:\n\nI really, really like the way you put patterns into your work. Not only does it make it look more interesting, but it adds an abstract feel to an experimental comic. Keep doing the swirls and the shapes, you're headed into a great direction with that.\nYou do very well with inner voice. You have an interesting narrative flow without getting too caught up in random stuff, which can happen easily with first person narratives. I like your non-cat person, and your odd fourth-wall breaking. You do it very well. It's hard to judge where the story is going, because it's still really short, or if it will have a story (It doesn't need to, if you're doing experimental) so I won't critique that just yet.\n\nAnd as for my critiques:\n\nWhen you scan it, take it into a program like photoshop or gimp, and mess with the levels and/or brightness and contrasts. I know you're trying to make sure that all your pencil marks still show up, but when the scans are yellowed or greyed out, your work doesn't have as much pop. I don't necessarily agree with everyone saying you should go digital, there's a purity in traditional ink lines that suit your story well. But perhaps try and go all ink, or keep playing with the bright shapes of your pastels if you want to go in color. You can practice cross-hatching with inks to still get the greys you want rather than using a pencil, and everything would look more crisp.\nThis is something that will happen naturally the more you draw, but since you're doing all these abstract patterns in the background, and this is an experimental comic, perhaps play with abstracting the characters a bit as well? Perhaps try like...noodle arms for the characters, rather than right-angle arms and elbows. Play with the shapes of them and see what you can make. It'd be fun too : )\n\nThose are really the only critiques I have. I feel you are nailing what you have set out to do. I think it's very cute, and I want you to keep going with it : )"", ""i like it. Its interesting and original. I like the idea of it, and its silly. And what matters is that you enjoy what you do. And your art style, i wouldn't worry about that. If you look at my comic, the art styles are really not that different. http://tapastic.com/series/Unkillable if you read this, expect some bad language. i hope thats okay."", 'Well i like it personally, your expressions XD it could use some work but i think its funny and its great you make a hand drawn comic with sone fun and unique patterns.
