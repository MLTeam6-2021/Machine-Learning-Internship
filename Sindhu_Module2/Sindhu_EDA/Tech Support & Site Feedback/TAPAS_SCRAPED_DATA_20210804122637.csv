I would like to know if you guys face such Link Problem?

While people click the link of my comic on Facebook (Link1: https://tapas.io/episode/22273651 ),only Tapas App open. The App show it's Home Page and my comic didn't appear at all.
But when I used new type of Link (Link2: https://tapas.io/series/Random-Balloons-in-the-Sky/ep1),It work sometime on some People but some are not.

6,"Lost all my text on draft, help please!",Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I was using Tapas Dashboard recently to edit my written chapters on my phone and hit preview to see what it would look like on mobile.

When I went back to the page where my draft was everything I had written down in that episode had disappeared and I hadn’t cut it or anything and even though I tried to, the undo would not work. When a document is in draft it also saves automatically so there’s no way to access older versions of the document.

Is there a way to contact tapas and ask for a fix, so that I can get my username when it's not taken anymore?

This is kind of a problem when I'm reading something with like 100+ updates and I'm still on episode 20. I'd like to keep my old bookmarks so I don't lose where I am (especially in a novel, where there are no pictures to quicky figure out where I am)

14,Bug: Early Access comics don’t remember my place,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"This has been going on for months so I have a good amount of data on it: when I get a notification that an early access comic I'm subscribed to has updated, and I click that notification to go to the comic, it takes me NOT to the most recent page, but to a specific older page every time. Affected comics include The Flying Ship, Finding Home and Charity Case. I do not have an early access subscription to any series, so I get ""updates"" as the pages are released to the general public.
To use an example for clarity, the past eleven times I've gotten notified that The Flying Ship has updated, the link has taken me to episode 216 (4.37 - Of All The Days) instead of the most recent one. Before that, it was episode 200 (4.23 - SLAM!). 
It seems to have something to do with certain pages not being marked as read, since episode 200 appears in black in the chapter list while episode 199 appears in grey. Similarly, episode 216 and all after it are black, but 215 is grey. (See images) It seems like when I go to a series to see the latest update, it takes me to the episode after the most recent ""read"" episode, so if none of the pages can be marked read, I'll keep getting bumped back to that certain point in the archive whenever I go to read it.
Would love to see a fix for this very annoying bug.","[""It looks like some sort of fix has been applied? All the affected comics have had their second-most-recent update marked as read for me, which has made the notification links work as expected. The older episodes are still unread, which doesn't constitute a problem for me but might be useful debugging information. I'll report back if the problem appears again with subsequent updates."", 'Okay, Finding Home has updated again and the notification successfully took me to the latest page; both the most recent public episodes are marked as read for me now.\nAdditionally, Charity Case just updated for the first time since the apparent fix, and although clicking through the first time took me to an old episode, going back to it now confirms that all the updates I scrolled through to get to the new one have been marked as read. Wish I knew who to thank, but this bug does seem to be resolved.', ""Ugh. Update: checked The Flying Ship today for the bonus update and the previous update (Engage Thighs, which I did indeed already read) had not been marked as read. The bug persists, but more intermittently than I had thought. Refreshing the page DOES mark Engage Thighs as read, but NOT Bonus: Feelin' Lucky, so I expect I'll get linked to Bonus: Feelin' Lucky the next time the comic updates.\n"", ""Okay after a few months of reading I'm happy to report that this issue is, afaict, totally resolved.

17,Tapas Blocked My Entire Series For ‘Child Endangerment Content’,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I just found out that my comic, Until You Confess, was blocked or removed 2 days ago. Tapas staff, H.E. Stiles wrote a private message to my profile wall, saying : 
""I am messaging to inform you that your series Until You Confess contains child endangerment content that violates our Content and Community Guidelines, and thus has been blocked.Please review our site Content and Community Guidelines for further details: https://help.tapas.io/hc/en-us/articles/11500532370715

I don't know if you have read my comic yet, but I made a comic that tells a story about a boy who is in identity crisis, trying to find out who he is with the help of another boy who likes him. I think there's some images left in internet if you're interested to find out, because I can't give the comic's link, they're all have been removed.
I just feel confused because I don't think I made some content that is violating Tapas' guidelines, but they didn't point out what's wrong or where is the scene that violates the guidelines out of 50+ episodes that have released so far. I've replied to H.E Stilles, and also emailed Tapas, mentioned Tapastic account on instagram, but I haven't received any replies yet for more than 24 hours. I can't figure out what is wrong, and I can't help getting anxious. Some of my subscribers that can not find the series were also asking.

There’s a really great series on Tapas right now called “Wait Where the Shooting Star Falls” . It just got officially released and translated not even a month ago (6/11).

I thought this has to do with tapas guidelines about mature scenes because a mature scene is included on the first two episode but when I tried to read the guidelines again, it says that ""penetration"" is allowed on novels as long as it helps the plot and incase with my story, the sex scene is really important because the main character\'s work is being a prostitute.

Size guideline

Auto cropping feature
Images with a height of 2000px or higher will be automatically uploaded as multiple images.

At first i was happy to see that there's no longer a height limitation. I thought it would be easier for me to upload my episodes, because they're very long and i always had to cut them into many little images for each update. But then i was surprised to see that there's a limitation to 40 files max !
Which means that the size limitation is even more restricted than before! I am honestly disappointed with this change and do not understand it. I have always preferred Tapas to Webtoon because I didn't have the same concerns about uploading my episodes. But now Tapas became worse then Webtoon and I have to find a solution and cut my episodes in several parts which ruins the pacing.","['Oh no, that\'s bad.They should keep the old feature since it worked.There\'s an old saying, ""when it works, don\'t change.""', ""I'm pretty sure there was always a file limitation of 40 files per episode.

That is a valid concern of the OP and for the rest of us who upload files in excess of 2000px. \n20 of these 4000px files will max out the 40 file limit that did exist before, but was not a problem when files were not auto-cropped."", ""The problem is actually the height limit to crop. Before, the height limit was 4000, now it's 2000. It means that a page with 4000 of height takes now the space of two files instead of one, so the total length maximum is smaller.\nI wish they would go back to pages of 4000px, honestly. I've been doing pages within this limit since always, and the cropping messes up the sharing thumbnail. They could keep the cropping feature, just increase the page height limit."", ""Yeah, and before that, the limit was 4000px, so you'd still need to use at least 2 files.\nedit: oh wait GloamingCat already brought up that.

Because, i quote : Images with a height of 2000px or higher will be automatically uploaded as multiple images..

E-mails exist for something, and it seems they use it only to send ""news"" about their official comics instead of using it to contact the creators themselves. 
And why did they have to block my whole series? Making it impossible for readers to see my comic through the app? Why not just block that problematic episode instead?
My whole series has been blocked since May 19th, that's 12 days without being able to receive any view or ink drop from readers through the app.

Does everyone lack this feature or am I just using an outdated version of Tapas? If there is no SoundCloud support for the mobile app, is Tapas planning on implementing it in a future update or is it impossible?

89,Tapas Notifications set as “Alarms”?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"So I'm normally not one to complain about Tapas notifications. I get that Tapas is a business and it's necessary to have these push notifications about new premium series etc....But one just crashed my computer and I really feel like I need to flag this as an issue.
I have my Windows 10 set up so that only ""alarm"" notifications will show up while I'm playing a game. This means that most Tapas notifications, like ones about likes and comments and the like will not pop up on my screen when I'm in the middle of something that's pushing my computer's processor.But lately I've noticed that the ones with the pictures about Tapas premium series still pop up even if I'm playing a full-screen game. Worse, it's impossible for me to make them go away without clicking on the ""close"" button, which jumps me from the game to Windows, which may be in a different resolution. Just now, this jump caused my whole system to crash as I tried to remove a big advert by clicking ""close"" while in the middle of a game of Warhammer II Total War, got thrown into Windows and then had my system freeze.
Is it really necessary for these advert notifications to be set as ""Alarms""? I don't want to have to mute all Tapas notifications just for this, or to mute all alarms because sometimes they're important things like reminders about meetings at my day job or appointments etc. I'm not asking for the removal of ad notifications, but I'd really appreciate this setting being changed. It's quite frustrating.","['How do you even get that push?\nEDIT:Newer mind, found out.

Even though I was getting plenty of comments, votes, subscribers, everything, the notifications just weren\'t coming in. For months, I had to manually check the app for activity on my story. But the premium story notifications were coming in just fine every day. \nOf course, when I raised this issue with tapas, I was told that the problem needs to be with my settings, though somehow it fixed itself after a certain update. I\'m glad it\'s finally working now, but yeah, I feel like something is different in the settings of these premium notifications, where they even get in the way of your gameplay.

I can either block all notifications from Tapas (which I don't want to do because the other non-alarm notifications are nice to let me know about comments etc. plus they're not in the way because they don't pop up if I'm in a game), or I can make it so no alarms show up when I'm in a game or similar full-screen application, but I can't just have alarms from Tapas not show up.""]",5/24/2021 9:25,,,,,,,,,
90,Files are compressing on me,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Something I've noticed and hasn't been a problem with past updates (this is for something I uploaded this week to my scheduled updates) is that, while I expect some file compression on the files I upload to Tapas, I'm getting a LOT more file compression than usual, which makes a fuzzy appearance on my details. I did the uploads a few times, and I tested by resaving my files a few times thinking...maybe it's on my end. But, while it's a little hard to tell the difference, it gives my perfectionist heart an ache because I spent time and energy making this look clear, and now on the update it just...fuzzes it out anyway.
hopefully this won't compress the image as I upload it to the forum, but this is a part of the original file that has pretty crisp hatching (and this full file is 940 px wide, but so tall it will get cropped by the editor)

And after uploading, the same details become fuzzy.

the-fuzziness.jpg296x537 118 KB

Again...this may look almost the same, but previous updates never had this happen to this degree, so I think some update to the editor is causing it to just...compress more than it normally does?

91,I don’t get the library system at all,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"My biggest issue with Tapas continues to be with the library system and what episodes the site leaves me on and all of that. There's no way to sort the library other than ""unread,"" ""date,"" and ""name,"" but today, when I clicked on several stories to catch up on them, instead of giving me the episode where I left off, each story I clicked catapulted me to random episodes with a pattern I couldn't quite understand.
That's not to mention the site's very annoying habit of marking an episode as read just because you clicked on the story at all. Anytime I ever click on a certain story to, say, share the URL with a friend, the main URL will usually show me the most recent episodes I have not read.. and mark that as read as well. Then, if you refresh for any reason... it marks the NEXT episode as read as well!

Honestly, sitting there counting and trying to remember up to what day in the month or next month I have uploaded until is hard. Especially when I spent like an hour or two uploading 30 chapters in a day to preschedule them to come out daily. Like trying to remember which day I am uploading them to when I couldn't see on the calendar what I had already uploaded and filled up was always a freaking hassle.
Like now I can see I uploaded chapters till Thursday and need to add one for every day after and no longer have to worry I missed a day, or that I may accidentally put two on one day, not notice keep uploading and then realize I have to go back and push every single chapter forward a day.

I go back to their page and the comic is there, it has been updated and works perfectly fine and I'm not blocked. (For example, I specifically  subscribed to CrimeandCars, and one day it was missing from my library and had to sub again).

141,Errors in statistics - subscriptions and likes,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello!
Recently I've noticed that there is a difference in numbers between what's displayed on my profile, on dashboard, and on the page of my one and only series regarding subscriptions and likes. As is: 
Subscriptions on profile: 125
Subscriptions on series and dashboard (and app): 124



However, when you count the subscribers by yourself on the list (on website), there are actually 125 after all (not that much counting, just number of pages multiplied by 20 which is how many subs are displayed by page + the number on the last page). I don't suppose it's the matter of having a lost subscription, as recently I did actually lose one and both numbers went down by a factor of 1.
A similar thing happens with likes, though it's even wilder in discrepancy. 
Dashboard: 193 (total) likes - does it perhaps still count removed likes or something?
Series info (website): 187 likes
And the app says 190 likes.
However, when you count likes on dashboard>performance, the total is 191. I'm also getting 191 after counting likes on series' episode list on the series sidebar.
Perhaps with the likes it's a matter of a delay in updates, but it's been over a week since I've noticed the subscriptions error, would it really take that long? It doesn't matter what browser I use either. Clearing cache and cookies didn't change anything as well.
Links to profile and series in case you'd like to check what numbers you see.

Of course people tend to say that there is copyright infringement, but, unless you are claiming to own the characters, or anything from the franchise (as logos, or music), you are protected with under Fair Use. The biggest problem here is not the protection under what the creator creates, but how he protects himself, as there is a disproportion of forces between the industry and the creators. For example, if you create a Fanfiction of Harry Potter, we all know how J.K. Rowling may answer if she get to know about it, and you will have to go tothe court to prove your point, and there is a big difference between the economic capability of a little fanfiction creator, and J.K. Rowling and Warnes Brothers to hire lawyers.In those same lines. for a site, like Tapas, Webcomics, or even DeviantART, its easier to don't expose Fanfictions to avoid all the 'cease and desist' orders, instead of offering the legal protection that we are entitled. It will cause too much noise, and for that they prefer the 'just original creations' aproach for their creators.Another way to avoid the 'cease and desist' orders is if the work is free to everyone (besides avoiding as much as it can the trademarked things, and give credit to the owners/creators), but as people mentioned before, there is the tricky part of the subs, and the redirections that you can offer in Patreon and donations sites. Fun Fact, Patreon is full of weird comic/fanfictions/mature content that are payed to be seen. How do they manage to keep working after doing what they do? I have absolutely no idea. Maybe because the patreons do not do much noise, and most of the content can't be seen until paid, the corporate industry don't bother with them.\nSorry for going outside topic, now you can go back to the genres and variety issue =D"", 'Understandable.

Original creators need spaces like Tapas to remain as fan-work-free as possible.\nIf you muscle out the creators of original content on every platform with a tide of fan work, you'll find fewer and fewer quality stories on 'big' media to enjoy in the future.

187,FEATURE REQUEST: Stats regarding the percentage of readers accesing Tapas from mobile devices VS the website,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"This is something I'd find deeply informative, and very useful when making decisions about how my comic is formatted and released.
At the moment, I release Blue Star Rebellion in a standard comic book page format here on Tapas.  I have a vertical version on WEBTOON, a formatting decision I made because the audience there is younger, and many readers only have access to their phone as a digital device. I've been debating whether to make the change to a vertical format here on Tapas, too, but I've been hesitant, as I do like reserving a space for my page format version to be enjoyed.
It would be invaluable to have access to stats regarding what percentage of Tapas readers in general read on mobile vs webpage, and be able to compare those with the same stats but specifically for one's own comic. 
If, let's say, 60% of readers on Tapas read using the mobile app, but only 10% of my own readers do, clearly I'm missing a huge chunk of potential audience and I should probably change my posting format. But if those numbers weren't so disparate, I'd feel much more secure in my decision to keep posting my comic in its original page layout.
Is there anywhere public where the up-to-date stats regarding website vs mobile access for Tapas in general are available? Having access to just those stats alone would be pretty helpful. The last hard stat I could find was on a 'Creators Guide To Taptastic' comic from 2014.  (That one said 6 in 10 readers were on mobile.)","['Yes this would be a really helpful feature. \nI know the analytics we have are going to be limited by the fact that Tapas doesn\'t ask for a lot of data on our profiles (fair, can\'t complain, I know a lot of us are sick of giving out personal data), so I can\'t request things like ""how old are my readers? What gender? What country are they from? Where do subscribers and readers find the comic? (ie. app/page, external links like the forums, social media sites like twitter and insta)"" even though those are stats I\'d love to have...

216,Tables in Novels,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hi, I'm really excited about the new Novel text editor update coming in this update:
https://tapas.io/newsfeed/1637
Text alignment and images are something really great that's been sorely needed in a ton of novels on the site, so I'm really happy. But there's one more thing that I am wondering has been included: Support for Tables. Not necessarily adjusting or changing the tables, but at least preserving their structure when copypasted from a word processor.
I write a couple LitRPG stories, which means tables tend to be a pretty important part of its content. In my story posting currently to Tapas, the tables are simple enough that I can make workarounds to avoid them, but I know other authors have more complicated LitRPG elements that would make it very difficult. A number of authors extremely popular on other fiction sites have expressed interest in Tapas, except that they wouldn't be able to post their stories on the site without table functionality, so I'm really hoping that the new site update will allow it. Does anyone at Tapas staff have the ability to confirm whether tables will or will not work?","[""I haven't studied the changes yet, but I guess one could paste tables in as images?"", ""That's right; they could be images. Although, I know that that's a very clunky solution for most LitRPG writers who often use a table almost every chapter, and it would be difficult for visually impaired users reading with screen reader software. \nIt's not the biggest, most important change but it would benefit a lot of stories not yet on Tapas... So I'm really hoping the new update will allow it!"", ""It APPEARS like this may actually be possible. I copypasted the next chapter of my web novel and this showed in the preview:\n\nScreenshot 2021-02-18 12.10.09.png1379x859 116 KB\n\nNow, the different font makes me wonder if it might not carry over to the actual published page, but I'll check in tomorrow once this chapter actually releases."", ""If it's a jpeg or png the font remaining the same shouldn't be an issue. It being an image is the equivalent of a pdf really, so it will preserve the formatting. The sizing of it on an app vs desktop would be more of a concern than the text changing."", ""Oh it's not an image; it's an actual table like you would find in Word or Google Docs. However, when I copypasted the table, the font remained the same as the source from which I took, rather than the rest of the text which converted to the standard.\nNow, that's not me complaining or anything! I am just really happy to see tables happen even if it takes an extra step to make sure it's readable. That's the easy part."", ""Really!? Now I'm curious to see how well this works. "", ""I am too! I'll be testing it out a lot with my LitRPG in the next few weeks."", ""I'll be watching for updates "", 'Make your tables in your document then use your computer to take a screenshot of your screen.

Everything else is great, but not having the option to change the order of chapters has been really frustrating. Let me explain my situation...
When I uploaded my very first chapter, I wasn't thinking. I just dumped it in without second thought. But since then, I have changed my mind about my story. I want to do a series, all with one link, instead of making multiple stories (links) for sequels, of which are quite a few. So I want to have an introductory chapter where I could include stuff like summary (for the first book) and cover. Instead, I want to change the actual summary of my story for one that is about the series as a whole, and not only the first book. But if I write that chapter now, I can't place it at the beginning, instead, it would randomly be in the middle of chapters. My only option is to delete all of my almost 80 published chapters and redo everything (which I think is obvious why that would not be practical) I also thought about including character designs once they are done, but that would also be awkward if they were included in a random chapter in the middle of the story...

One, I just found out that GIFs don't loop on desktops anymore while they do on the app and that's a shame because I've started a new comic that should regularly feature GIF sequences.
And two, Soundcloud songs used to keep playing if you put the same link across multiple episodes but now they restart every time you move to the next or the previous episode.

It looks at the image and then it looks at the alt text that\'s attached to the image and reads that out, if that makes sense. Like you know when an image on a webpage doesn\'t load properly and it instead says ""image_of_a_flower.png"", that\'s alt text.

Like if I were making something and I wanted feedback but only from people like...in a discord or in this forum, I could just leave the password and not have to worry about rando's from other places being like ""oh is this a new comic!?""
Like obviously these would be projects you can't really...promote or get attention towards, but it's just a thing I wish we had just because it helps when you have very long, long images that you want to share with others but don't have many places you can do it other than making your own webpage from scratch (and not everyone has their own web page anymore)","[""I just wish tumblr allowed for stacking art better. There's always that line in between images, and you don't get a feel for how the comic would look on the site here unless you...upload it here and like...give it a really long scheduled update or something.\nJust feels like a lot of websites have the option for password protected content, especially when we have a lot of kids on this site who...maybe don't want to make something that the entire internet is privvy to, youknow?\nBut as far as money goes, I feel like most of the money for tapas comes from the top comics, as well as other sponsers and other advertising and mobile tie ins that they have. So the rest of our server space is paid for from that income. Most comics here aren't making enough money to support their presence, if they make any at all, but our activity within our community and on the site supports it.

You can make those sites password protected, and you can also use a plugin to connect your Patreon page to Wordpress sites if you want to do it that way.

This would just be the same, but probably shorter in length. Hell they could even make an episode cap of like--no more than 10 episodes or updates for private pages and I would be so happy just to have that space to test.\n@thedude3445 I think, if you went the route of doing your own website for just a couple of test episodes--which is what I'm referring to--it'd be better to just make one off of googlesites or something.

I know there is the Wall feature, but that's just for the author's profile and not the comic itself. I think it would be cool if we could have these kind of one-off posts inside the comic itself. To prevent authors from spamming their comics, the reader can choose an option ""Show Episode uploads only"" or something like that. Let me know what you think of this idea.","[""It would be really nice to have some kind of side area that was attached to a specific comic or novel to put side materials like bios, holiday art and omake strips. I'd like to add things like that, but I feel like they disrupt the flow for archive readers if they're not between chapters, so I'm limited on where I can put them since my chapters are several months long.\nThere definitely needs to be a better alternative to the wall.

So I've been thinking about some ways Tapas could improve and what I personally would like to see on the platform to make being a creator easier and I thought about the idea of having an 'Announcement' (or Update) tab per story. 
Here's an example of what I mean using my own story:

Screen Shot 2020-12-15 at 12.25.48 PM.png1306x708 275 KB

It would update and look like regular episodes, but this way they can be separated so the actual flow of the story isn't disrupted.

Screen Shot 2020-12-15 at 12.22.28 PM.png1624x856 429 KB
 
 This way you can engage more specifically with your audience and update them about things surrounding a specific story (especially for readers who may not check your page or follow you on social media).
What do you guys think? Would this be something you'd be interested in seeing? Do you have any other ideas on what you'd like to see?
I mean, I have nothing to do with the running of Tapas, but I had this idea and thought I'd share ","[""I definitely think that there needs to be a better way to add announcements for readers, especially on app. As it is, our only option is PC, which 99% of readers won't know to check.

If this were an app feature, I would love it !"", ""I need this in my life \nEdit: People will actually unfollow authors if they make too many announcements because there's just no good way of doing it. I think this would be fantastic for creators and readers alike."", ""I think something like that would be pretty great, actually. Especially when I'm going through and bingeing an older series, it can be a little jarring when you're really into the story and then you're interrupted with an announcement episode for something that ended two years ago.

If there was a way to filter those out when reading, I'm sure both creators and readers would appreciate it."", 'Hmm, neat', ""This would be so nice!\nSince adding announcements as their own episodes, it has shifted my count.

The worst is when you plan on deleting the announcement, but then you don't want to get rid of the small number of likes and comments on it because you don't wanna see your numbers go down, especially since Tapas bases a story's success a lot by engagement"", ""Exactly! \nPlus the Author's page is super hard to find on the app and it's hard to engage with (since there's no like button and you have to comment on the posts. And sometimes announcements don't need a whole comment). And on top of that, the author page can be kept for more general announcements, while this idea is specific to a story!"", ""I agree. Most of my readers only use the app. I also really like this because it means that announcements can be made without updating the story, which seems like a silly thing but is very important. \nFor example: What if someone has a Q&A coming up and wants to make a reminder before the chapter releases? Or what if a creator is on hiatus and still wants to have some interaction or communication with their reader base? \nThis format would have saved me so much hassel tbh.

276,I really wish for a Reading List option in the Library,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"My main suggestion/feedback for Tapas, the one thing that would get me to use the website/app significantly more, is if the Library function were modified to allow for Reading Lists. It's a function that makes so many sites really nice and one that would really help people like me who like to do a lot of sorting.
Right now, subscriptions are all jumbled up into one Library category; you can sort by recent updates or names, or between comics and novels, but you cannot sort them by things like ""date subscribed"" or ""date of last chapter read"" even though that data is certainly available to use. The reason this is a problem for me is because my subscriptions are half stories I am keeping up with and reading updates for, but also half stories I have not read but am bookmarking for future reference. 
The more subscriptions I add, the harder it becomes to keep up with sorting the difference, and I often accidentally completely forget about certain comics for months on end. I've had to resort to adding a lot of comics to my RSS reader as a workaround; I now ignore the Library feature entirely.
The competitor site Royal Road does not have full Reading List capability, but it does have two lists to manage: Following, and Read Later, which is more than enough to sort the difference. It also shows the latest chapter you've read versus the newest chapter, something Tapas would very much benefit from:
2020-12-13 (1).png1534x807 265 KB
My Follow List on that site. The only ""problem"" here is that stories in the ""Read Later"" list do not count as Follows, so they don't show up for the author's stats at all. That likely isn't a significant issue for most users though and I doubt it would create much of a drop in subscriptions if implemented in the same way on Tapas.
Wattpad goes even further and allows users to create their own Reading Lists however they want, which allows them to sort stories into topics and community curated lists. I'd love to start, for example, a ""Recommended LGBT Stories"" list that I could share with people getting into Tapas, though I know the work involved in creating such a system would be significantly more than the option that Royal Road gives.
Either of these two systems would make Tapas such a better site for reading stories and my absolute go-to when it comes to web comics and web novels.","['OMG reading lists you could share would be so good.

Go BACK to the reading list.
Click on another comic with new content to read.CRASH.

This only happens if I am trying to read an update after I have already read an update on another comic, because if I go all the way back to the home screen and then back to the reading list I am able to select another comic to read.

Go BACK to the reading list.
Go BACK to the home screen.
Click ""Reading List"" again. 
Click on a comic to view.

321,Comments and likes being left on unreleased episodes!,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"HJELP
One of my subscribers was able to leave a comment on an unreleased page! They even could see that the update time was for the 27th next week and asked why they could see it.       I tried removing and reuploading the page, but it only worked for a little while and this morning, someone has left a like on the page. The page isn't recording views, only likes and comments, and it also doesn't show the scheduled icon on the thumbnail, but it does show that the release is the 27th still. (The page file is now just a thumbnail of itself to be safe)
Any help or insight would be appreciated, thank you!

This is particularly annoying, as I have an original soundtrack for my comic, and the songs often continue over 3-4 updates. I miss how it used to work. I don't know if there's an easy fix, but if there is, it would be much appreciated. And if there isn't, perhaps the widget shouldn't exists at all.

Now when I set a chapter for release, the background image behind the coming soon message is just a darkened image of my story banner.  I really liked having that little snippet of preview of the new art; does anyone know if there is a setting somewhere to change the darkened image back to being, say, what I chose for the facebook/social media banner?

can&#39;t-use-button.jpg845x677 179 KB

That little overlap unfortunately disables the button. 
Now it took me a while to figure out what was going on. But, I figured out it was because I set my zoom in firefox to 90%, because that's how I prefer my text to look. When I put zoom to 100% (which is normal), then the menu worked fine. So, I figure this is something you may want to fix since a lot of people change their standard text sizes through their browser, and anything less than 100% just busts this menu.

430,How to: Rich text in Tapas,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"So I just spent way too long to find a shortcut to paste rich text in Tapas, so in case anyone else wants to do the same thing, I figure I'd save you some time.Like most people (I think) I write in Word or Docs and copy it to whatever site I use. If you're reading this, you've probably realised Tapas deletes a lot of formatting when you do that, though. Here's how I solved it, in two steps:1. keep formatting in tapas text2. keep the Tapas font.
Keep formatting in tapas textCredit to Daniimei and this post8 for this one. it's a really clear explanation of what to do, and if you want to use the same font as in your text editor, this is all you have to do. Type a random phrase in the box (I usually just use TEST) and replace it in the HTML of the website with your rich text. (Again, the other post has a clearer step-by-step)
If, however, you're finickety like me and want to keep the default font, you'll need a few extra steps.
Keep the Tapas fontThe name of the Tapas font is a bit hidden, but it's called LORA. You can find it for download here.(or google Lora"",""Helvetica Neue"",Helvetica,sans-serif or just Lora font)Next, you'll have to install it: in Windows 10, go to settings> personalized settings> fonts. From there, you can click and drag the font file (you might have to unzip it) and you're done!If you want the exact size and shape the site uses, you can click on the font, scroll down to variable font properties and click that, and make sure the weight is on 400. The font size used on the site is 15.
I spent a little too much time on this, hopefully this'll help someone else out","['Or you could learn to italicize words less often.', ""Oh, I was wondering about that. \nIt's hella annoying and I wish that we could just paste HTML directly into tapas and have it understand it, but hey, this works. Thank you."", ""It's not just italics, though, it's also the lay-out I use to make text message strings understandable., and the line spacing that disappears. I figured it'd be helpful to some people, but you don't have to read, respond to, or implement tech support things when you don't feel like it."", ""It just doesn't feel like a robust writing style, and I mean that in the sense that it won't stand up to being translated into different formats and read on different devices and apps."", 'I think I recall trying that ""inspect element"" and replacing it as one of my first options with the Tapas editor when that post came up, and it didn\'t work for me. I was unable to paste into the inspect element\'s window for the HTML. And typing the raw HTML into the tapas editor, of course, does not work either.\n@rajillustration It works for me, if I\'m only doing... one italicized word or phrase within a single paragraph. Any more than that, say two words in two seperate quotes that need to be italicized for emphasis, are oddly abused by the CSS system. The first is treated as the regular tag, and the second is treated as a new-paragraph tag under Tapas\'s customized coding. \nThe base problem doesn\'t lie in that Tapas doesn\'t retain your formatting, it\'s that their site utilizes CSS and other coding to override or rather, highly customize to their (the dev\'s) needs over the user\'s / poster\'s. An example being that the code for italics is by default in HTML just the letter i, but Tapas has customized this to do .... inline / new paragraph / other stuff. The only way for, specifically italics, to be saved during the copy and paste procedure, is for Tapas\'s dev team to firmly re-engineer their CSS customization of the i tag and to replace their customization into a different tag (such as a class style). The devs will not do this, since that\'d involve likely breaking large parts of the site that are currently using the i tag to create the inline, or rather, new line paragraphs [For any HTML/CSS readers, they\'re basically using it to perform not the function of a br, but of a p tag, plus what looks like centering+header+font changes. which if you can tell from just browsing the site, is a lot.] It would be easier for the devs to create a new tag line for us, the poster\'s, to use such as .... say the letter q or z - something that is not commonly used in general coding language. The problem with that however, is that while we might be able to manually insert this coding tag as < q >, we will still be unable to paste and retain our italics, since programs like Word utilize translating the Italics into the generic i tag. We would, as poster\'s, have to go in manually and one by one open and close the new tag around every, single, instance, that we want italicized.I did just do a quick skim and read through the current code, not checking the CSS\'s cause those take a while to read and figure out what\'s being used and what\'s .... archived. Tapas\'s team with the newer homepage is still retaining the i tag but is using it as both a default to change things, and applying classes to it (i.icon.nav ect). Which again, if all of those classes are underneath the default i tag.... it\'ll take a bit of work to undo that code because by now, it\'s all integrated in as part of the spaghetti code. Unless from the very VERY beginning, they worked their site to allow for easier changes to elements by being able to swap out active CSS pages (not something many, most or, more than like... coders.... do for fun), then it\'ll require time / rebuilding the site. All to just not use the i tag .... inappropriately.\nTLDR Tapas does retain your italics coding, but their site coding is set up to overwrite it to their customized needs for it.\n\nimage.png910x221 9.97 KB\nFor anyone wondering, this is from the home page currently, and you can see that they\'re using the i class for at least 3 different things just in the navigation menu.It looks like... they\'re treating the i ... uh command (class isn\'t the real technical name for it) to be short for the img one. So instead of typing img src=""mature-icon"" ect, it\'s just i class=""mature-icon"". Same for it being used to bring up specific ""special"" characters without them needing to utilize special fonts that not all devices might have access to - in this case, pre-made icons to give the illusion of the symbols - such as the drop down arrow after the word ""Discover"" in the home bar.And remember, this is just the top of the top of the TOP of the home page. I haven\'t even glanced at a ""regular"" comic or novel page, or the new table of contents for a work, or someone\'s library.', ""All of the book titles in my story had their italics removed when I copypasted it and it was annoying because I didn't catch it until like Chapter 25  I never use italics for emphasis in my stories, but I do sometimes use them for flashback-type text and so it's annoying that it automatically disappears."", 'I actually appreciated having to manually re-italicize things.

Is there  a way to add chapters in between already existing one? I'm getting the hang of the platform (Finally  )But apparantly my chapters are too long for what people like around here.

I apologize if this is the wrong thread to ask for assistance, I wasn't sure where to turn. I'm enjoying Traceless Knight at the moment but chapter 17 seems to have some issues. So far I've unlocked every chapter without issue, but this one behaves in a confusing way. I did actually unlock chapter 17, the lock disappeared but the chapter is still telling me to unlock it. When I click on unlock again, it simply shows me the ink purchase window, but I have enough ink so it should not be an issue. I think something might have gotten stuck during the unlock process.
I would be very grateful if someone can aid me in this matter, maybe I'm doing something wrong.

As soon as plug in a new one, order a backup.  Just in case.  \nHowever, to avoid having to use your backup, here's a product that is actually effective keeping that connector straight and safe.  \n\n\netsy.com10\n\n\n\nWacom Cintiq Cable Support Adapter Original and 2.0 Edition (BACK IN STOCK!!!)\n***UPDATE 8/7/19***  Due to WACOM EU sending me an email asking me to remove the WACOM logo from my clip because of trademark infringement on my part, I have to redesign my clip to not have the WACOM logo on it.

It is a little annoying to have a bump on the side of the wacom that you sometimes bump the side of you hand on, but way less annoying than continuously replacing the expensive cable.  \nI'm not sure if this is the brand I originally purchased, but it looks the same except for mine had the wacom logo on it (which I wondered at the time if they were technically allowed to use since it's an aftermarket part) and this one says badrobot instead.  I think it's the same guy and maybe he was asked to remove the logo?  I dunno.  It's basically a 3D printed adapter that you snap onto you cintiq and thread your cord through as you plug it in.  The thing holds the cord pretty solid so that even pretty rough handling isn't going to bend that easily-bent metal end.  It installs in a way that s removable, in case you need to transport your cintiq or something.  However, my cintiq never leaves the vicinity of my PC, so I used some electrical tape on the back to get it really solidly adhered.  It's not going anywhere now.

441,App update - Copy & Pasting (android),Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"@ratique
Hello! I know some updates were made to the app as well as the site (for android at least) and I recently realized that with this new update readers can now copy and past from the story! Im not sure if that's been mentioned or not yet!
This wasn't allowed before (I remember because I would always need to keep scrolling back and forth when quoting  something from the story in a comment) and just wanted to let yall know in case you werent aware! I attached a photo of me doing it with my story but I can select any text from any story!
Screenshot_20200619-205750_Tapas.jpg1440x2960 741 KB

Also, two more things about the tapas app update (not as big a deal as the copy paste thing but something I also feel is worth mentioning) 
Now theres always this huge chunk of blank space at the top of every chapter, and it's not a big deal but it just kinda looks weird  
Screenshot_20200619-205940_Tapas.jpg1439x2908 730 KB

And before the update I feel like a reader would be able to click on the creators profile pic or name at the bottom of the chapter and it used to take you to the creators page and show you their other work, but now pressing it just toggles the top and bottom bar. This was usually how I would go the creators page and check out their other works, and it's a habit to press it when reading stories and comics. It took me a second to realize that now the only way to do that was to press the three buttons on top and then click the go to creator button. Again, not that big of a deal, but it does feel a bit more cumbersome and it might make readers not go through the extra steps.
20200619_211002.jpg1440x2960 584 KB

So, last two arent that urgent, about 90% of my reader base have let me know they use the mobile app to read, so that's why I'm just being hyper aware of what its like to use the app and nitpicking it from the stance of a reader. The first one I feel like might be a security thing and in the past copy and pasting want an option and while it does make quoting a line from the story easier, I think most writers might appreciate that getting looked into!

456,Android App glitching to the wrong episodes! (Verified by audience and author),Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Heyo!
I've just started weekly posting for my series Snapshot, and my subscribers have been reporting the android app is linking them to the wrong pages.
When I first posted these pages, despite being scheduled at separate times entirely, they were uploaded out of order. I have since corrected them, but it seems the android app hasn't quite gotten the memo. (The issue of pages uploading out of order was also a problem in my last chapter, which caused TWENTY pages to be jumbled and the entire chapter had to be taken down.)
These pages are displaying properly in order on my desktop, and on the browser version of Tapastic on my phone, but I have verified myself that the android app version of Tapastic will jump from page 1 to page 4 (even though they correctly scroll 1,2,3,4 on desktop). Pages 2 and 3 will brick entirely and not load any page when you try to scroll on the android app. 2 and 3 are attempting to load page 1 when scrolled down, but it never actually loads anything.
Both the issue of scheduled upload times not uploading when they are supposed to AND having the android app not recognize when correction is made is starting to affect my audience's ability to read even a few pages. I pull in at least 300-400 views per page in the first 3 hours of my comics going out, which means a large chunk of my audience is receiving confusing, out of order updates which I can't correct until I get home from work.
** I would also like to echo a common request on the forums-- please-- introduce a feature that allows episodes to be re-ordered. Removing episodes to correct ordering issues causes massive chunks of views, favorites and comments to be lost, and it's a huge kick in the teeth to audience engagement and enjoyment of a series! **","['Bumping to Tapas staff @Yoon @michaelson (pardon the normie learning how to use servers <3)', ""This has been happening for quite awhile (it was July when it happened to me at least, other for a lot longer) another in Mid August and a third early September.

Proof of that is in a novel I have that\'s tagged a lot of chapters as ""M"" here on Tapas largely for language, and it has more reads per update than any ""serious"" writing I have done. It\'s just the nature of online consumerism and how the stats play out from what I\'ve seen. \nAs for Tapas itself, I\'m not certain they\'ll allow it without having to restructure novels as they\'re submitted from the ground up. Which my  guess, sounds like entirely new coding. As it stands now, it seems to be that the ""novel"" submission can only hold a certain size of Mb, which is smaller than the comics - since comic images are uploaded into segments and then ordered by the author prior to release. I just hit the limit on dA a bit ago for a pure text upload, and it was something like 9,500 words~10,000 words somewhere in there is the threshold for too large (though it could be number of characters that determines the hard line). I imagine that since we have to do ""a work around"" for Tapas to accept images currently into novels, and those images have to be under a certain Kb/Mb size, that the novel updates maximum per is significantly lower than comics. They could try coding the submission to be a ""rich text editor"" style which is what this forum uses, but this forum uses code that is not generated/created by Tapas staff directly, so that\'d be a contract they\'d have to hire out for...\nLots of possibilities on the cost / development side of things.\nAs for the actual implementation, as I said, I\'m conflicted.My first thought is what kind of demands are we now asking of authors? Authors who do not have images, for whatever reason, are they now considered beneath the popularity stack? Authors who don\'t use cartoony or anime-esque art work, are they now beneath the stack? What if they don\'t have a tablet or scanner, or way to make art? What if they just want to write and leave the exercise of imagination to the reader\'s brain based solely on words?Authors who write pure text are already fighting the ""attention span"" of the internet, which Tapas both supports and encourages (updates of 300-600 words of mine do far better than 1000 words or longer).To be clear I\'m not against it. But it does leave a bad taste in my mouth if I will then be expected to draw stuff for my novel to ""make it fit in better"". I personally, have no time or patience to waste on trying to draw when I\'ve already surmised the story would be too slow as a comic- which is why it is a novel. Others will feel differently.', ""I'm the mainly novelist friend in question! I've actually started collabs like this with a few artist friends over the years and it never really went anywhere - 'where would we host it?' has always been one of the first roadblocks we run into. They fell apart for unrelated reasons in early stages, but I think that it would be great to have a place to finally host this kind of stuff with ease where an audience can find you... there's really nowhere else that lets you do that, as far as I know. \nAnd just as a reader, I adore mixed media stuff like this!

I can access my revenue page from clicking on the available balance box on the dashboard's main page (the series section). But this new revenue page I reach through this rather indirect method seems to be a simplified version of the former version.

Anyways, thanks for the replies and suggestions everybody. ^u^

What's happening here and how do I fix it??
I tried replacing the nib and the problem persisted. I tried stopping and restarting Wacom Proffesional Services multiple times...and it kept happening. I tried rolling back to the previous driver...and it kept happening.I checked if ""press and hold"" was enabled, it wasn't, and nothing changed.I turned off ""flicks"" and nothing happened. I tried stopping and restarting Tablet PC Input thing-y, and it kept happening.I even tried uninstalling everything and only downloaded the previous driver, but then the tablet just stopped working all together.

524,Dark Mode PLZ?!?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"They may seem a weird or selfish request.
But I have health problems that give me extreme light sensitivity issues with my eyes. And with this update, OMFG my eyes are burning WHY is there so much blinding white with no way to tell one area or column from the other and an abundance of dead white space on monitors? 
Is there any way / hope of getting a dark mode option to switch to because as it is now I can't navigate the website without being in physical pain (I'm not over reacting, my eyes are burning) I can't even read my own comic, because my comic is black and white, and though it was a little iffy before it was still doable because there were other colours to help contrast the brightness and you could clearly tell the column areas of the site apart, even if it was just a black bar at the top or icons at the side, but now there is none and it's just, painful blinding white.
I know this is not a problem many people have and it's really selfish for me to ask but I use this site every day for my own comics and to read comics but now I can't. Is a dark mode at least coming up in future updates or something?","['I think this would be a great quality of life and accessibility addition.A lot of creators here are on the autism spectrum, which means a lot of us are more light sensitive than average people (my screen brightness is consistently turned down to about 30%), so adding a dark mode would really make life more comfortable for a lot of us, especially now the site has such a white-dominated theme.', 'I would be pleased with a less harsh theme ... perhaps something like this? or with the the black header back even?\nimage.png1000x631 445 KB\n', 'I have used a user-made browser dark-theme mode for more than a year now.

It's 10x easier to input a dark mode than install a ramp and the latter is pretty easy so imagine how easy it would be for them to do that and ... I guess they just never thought of it. Even while looking at that horribly bright, toilet-paper colored UI. Someone approved that. \nThen again, the more and more Tapas goes on, the more they become the antithesis to accessibility. \nEither way, it's 2020. Every website ever has dark mode.

But this is now the second time this bug has bitten me in the butt, so even though I still think it's obscure, I figure it's worth a heads-up.
I have a finished novel with roughly 60 episodes. I started by posting 40-ish of them, carefully formatting them (I f-ing hate italics on here, like all of you.). Took hours. Afterward, I edited SOME of them. Some for content, some for the date/time I wanted them to appear. And SOME of the unpublished episodes that I edited started showing up in the Android and iOS apps - but not in browsers! - to my users.
Tapas has confirmed that this is a bug,
Noob ignorant me put up a wall post about this, including a screen shot of Tapas email confirming the bug, not realizing that the people who really needed to see this - app users - would not get the notification!
Lesson learned.
Today I realized that not only are the unpublished episodes still showing in the apps (I hadn't really expected them to be fixed this quick, for the record), but it's a different set of episodes.
So today I pulled all my scheduled episodes, in the process accidentally deleting the episode I put up this morning. Hours of work and formatting, gone. I'm really upset.

583,Make Tapas Better: Store and Collab Tab,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I've been on this website for quite a while, and it's undoubtedly one of the most refined for it's type: User generated comics. It's got quite a lot going for it, nice design, user friendly etc.
However, that being said the aforementioned make the website very viewer friendly but not so much creator or collaborator friendly.
I see a lot of features that should be integrated into the main site being delegated here to the forums, where a lot less people are likely to see and use them.
That is quite a shame seeing the obvious care being put into making the website, an otherwise highly refined experience.
As such I propose the following to be considered to be implemented with a future update:
A user generated merch store tab: Creators who have merchandise of their comic or novel, both physical and digital can advertise their product line-up in this tab.

This way it can be an interesting, additional way of supporting your favorite content creators, as opposed to or in combination with the traditional Patreon/Ko-Fi routes. 
This tab also serves to centralize into one location and browse user generated merchandise instead of having to go into website like Kickstarter or the user's website/social media to search for their stuff.

It seems to me a great way of: A) Helping passionate creators out B) Helping fans get the stuff they might want C) Maintain an edge/advantage over competitor websitesD) Serve as a factor to promote creator retention i.e: It would make them think twice in potentially signing an exclusivity contract with'a competitorE) A fair way for the website to get a commission from, and fund further improvements and features
A collaboration tab: Creators, both authors and illustrators, amateur and professional would be able to put up their services here and connect with fellow creators.

This would essentially be like a Fiverr style service store, but exclusively for authors and illustrators. This tab could be connected to the creators home/wall page, for better accessibility.
This tab can be divided further into services sections, e.g: Colorists, Illustrators, Editors, Authors. Maybe Graphic designers.  And then on their commission profile, their specialization eg: Sci-Fi Backgrounds or Cartoon style Character designs and Animation etc.
The tab's results can be filtered by price, by recommendations, by style, by how long their willing to work, how fast etc.
This would be a great solution for passionate creators to be able to easily connect to one another, in a much more formalized and organized way. As well as to centralize creator's portfolios.

During my time in this forum I've seen many creators desperately trying to find ways to get audience support or to find creative partners.  Why not simplify this process, include it into the site? Give the creators a better platform for doing that? 
These are just two ideas that I could think of on how to enable better creator accessibility, if you have your own ideas, please feel free to post them, I'd love to hear your ideas and better yet, see them incorporated into this website.","[""By the way, as a side note; is it just me or do most apps and websites remove features and restrict it's users more and more with every update?!\nYoutube did it with Adpocalypse and all it's of it's other awful updates.\nTumbler and even Tapas locked off half it's content and alienated it's creators by making mature content more restricted with it's last update... \nI swear, it's gotten to the point where updates are terrifying things to be feared instead of useful additions XD"", ""Tapas was actually because of Apple's policy - if they kept any of it visible on mobile, tag or no tag, they'd get kicked out of the store.

This tab could be connected to the creators home/wall page, for better accessibility.\n* This tab can be divided further into services sections, e.g: Colorists, Illustrators, Editors, Authors. Maybe Graphic designers.  And then on their commission profile, their specialization eg: Sci-Fi Backgrounds or Cartoon style Character designs and Animation etc.\n* The tab's results can be filtered by price, by recommendations, by style, by how long their willing to work, how fast etc.\n* This would be a great solution for passionate creators to be able to easily connect to one another, in a much more formalized and organized way. As well as to centralize creator's portfolios.\nDuring my time in this forum I've seen many creators desperately trying to find ways to get audience support or to find creative partners.  Why not simplify this process, include it into the site? Give the creators a better platform for doing that? \n\nI LOVE THIS IDEA TOO!  This would be really cool!  Have a Indeed/Craiglists Job Posting type deal would be nifty!  Different adds and different people can be like offering services OR asking for services with pricing options.  Good one!\nI would love to see BOTH of these options!\nI admit, it feels like a lot of sites are doing these things in restrictions.  But for Tapas, it really was because of Apple's policy.

Unfortunate."", ""I only had a half understanding of the updated Tapas Policy, and didn't consider Apple's involvement, you're right I guess I can't blame them for something like that, but I still think my general point stands.\nI was thinking more of an actual store, instead of the Tapas in-site currency, but the idea of a super support feature is pretty cool, I hadn't thought of that. And I guess there's no reason why the store can't continue using the ink currency. \nAlso, I didn't take into consideration the technical side of maintaining such a store, still I think that if it were included at least eventually, Tapas could take a commission from it. That way they could get additional support and build the site further. It would be a win-win in the long term."", ""I know that other sites, like DeviantArt, have an option for High-Res digital prints, so it doesn't have to be printed.  Though having a DeviantArt Digital Print and a Society6 shipping print option is super cool.\nUsing Ink currency would be great and since Tapas already has a built in function for converting ink into actually currency that is put into the Creators paypal account once it values $25, having the digital store front would only require, possible, extra storage space for extra Creator content as well as coding and designing such a storefront (or hell, maybe having it attached to the Creator Account and put it as a sidebar, a lot of ways of doing this)."", ""I can see why they don't want to do their own printing service for merch (I mean that's...that's a whole other business) but even if there was a way for us to better advertise our storefronts that are on different websites--a lot of comic creators have society6's, Etsy accounts, and etc, and it would help if we could have a better way to link to all that. As it is now the best I could do is advertise my other places in my comment on my pages or as an advertisement within my page update. Gross.\nBut I second the idea to put collabs somewhere else than this forum. It just doesn't seem to work out very well over here, that and it can be really daunting to put out an ad on the one and only forum on this website where everyone else can see it--including a lot of people that you know really don't want to see yet another collab ad. Even if they made a collab only forum that would be a huge step up from where it is now."", ""They did say that they didn't want the forum to be the place where the users soliciting sales because it will just full of peoples doing that and mostly just left after posting one or two things promoting their things.\nAnd tapas team is not...

it seems other people are still able to watch ads without problemslets say i just want to know if its a penalty from tapas (which i would totally understand)or an issue

I thought it was because it was something like a little punishment for being too greedy, but after three weeks of having only two videos available per day... I really start to believe that there's something wrong going on."", ""From what I have noticed (After watching literally thousands of advertisements) is that the ad system is set up on a region basis of how many people are watching ads at one time, if lots of people are watching ads in your area then you're probably not going to get to watch very many ads in a single day.  When I'm at home in my secluded (somewhat poorer area) not many people have the time nor care to watch ads so me and the few people who do play games/watch ads have an almost unlimited supply of ads, but when I'm at college I don't get ANY base ads, not a single one.  But at the same time there are 2 very different types of ads on the app.\nThe first type of ads are your normal everyday base advertisements that give anywhere from 4 to 14 coins (Mine is currently locked at 14) that you can watch anytime as long as the system is not overloaded with people watching ads all the time in that region.\nThen there is the second type higher tier advertisement which you are only allowed to watch at certain times of day, and sometimes at a random intervals of time through the day, that are based on the surveys that you complete.  Based on what put on that survey you will be put into an ad pool, and the more surveys you fill out the more ad pools you acquire that tend to stack (The limit on the ad pool is dependent on how long the ad is running irl).  On mine the ad pools are set up to start at 12:05 AM EST. In which the ads will play until the pool runs out.  The amount of coins you get from these ads is dependent on time, unlike the lower tier ads these ads are time based watching at first will give a certain amount (Usually small) then one hour later it'll give a higher or lower amount (Usually higher), the amount you receive could be any number from 9 to 50 per ad.  At first these ads were annoying because they were long with sometimes little pay off, but after figuring out the trick to them they're not that bad.\nI don't know how these two systems are set up in your region/phones but when you figure it out you can figure out the best time of day to watch ads based on how many other people are watching ads (During school days it should be a higher chance).Not sure if this'll help but it's what I've figured out from this system xD"", ""About 4 days ago I stopped getting base ads all together no matter where I am, I still get survey ads but I only get those at specific times of day.  But I'm also not getting any ads in the game Drilla which means both the Tapastic ads and some other app ads share the same ad pool.  I don't think Tapas has any control over if ads are shown or not, I think it's based on the company they use to show advertisements."", ""I can always watch 25 to 30 ads a day... They're only like 5 different ads though haha."", 'Hi, good morning, wanted to infrom of a problem that i am having whit the app.\nThe problem is that it has been three days in a row without the app allows me to view ads to get free coins\nIs this normal in the app?\nIs there any solution?\nThank you very much for your time, thanks and greetings', ""I havent had issues with it.

Then it decreased to about 10 to 20 ads per day and now none.It all happened in the same region of course (Leipzig, Germany) and if it's really a regional issue that means someone somewhere just stopped the ad availability here.

624,How to Insert Animated GIF (.gif) Into Tapas Novel?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I've been searching high and low for help on this. I've finally managed to insert light little images into the Novel chapters (if anyone needs to figure out how, I've written my way of going about it below). But, I still don't know how to insert a light little animated GIF (in NOVELS). Is this possible on Tapas?
As for images, this is how I went about it:
Step 1: You need to have Mozilla Firefox, this won't work on other browsers.
Step 2: Pull up your chapter as if you're editting it for a typo or something and make sure that you've clicked the actual text box.
Step 3: Pull up the picture you want on MSPaint (easiest program for conversion) and then save it as "".png"" because apparently it keeps the quality without the weight! Here I thought it needed to be a .gif...I was so wrong. Anyway, you save it as a "".png"" but you DON'T CLOSE OUT OF MSPAINT.
Step 4: Select the picture (Ctrl + A) and copy it (Ctrl + C) straight out of MSPaint.
Step 5: This is where it gets tricky! Remember how you have your chapter ready to edit in firefox? Well, click in the chapter where you want the pic to go (it can literally go anywhere above or after text in the chapter) and then you have to USE YOUR MOUSE to ""left click, paste"" the picture inside. You can't ""Ctrl + V"" it.
Step 6: Save it however you want (I usually click ""save"" and ""don't send announcement"" so I don't spam ppl with my edits, but you can save it however you want).
Step 7: If the chapter refuses to save, that means the picture is STILL too high quality. So, you should try to shrink it a bit on MSPaint, OR save it as a "".gif"" and THEN save it as a "".png"" to make it even less heavy.","[""speaking from experience, tapas is truly an awful place to put gif files even in comics because the file size limit is so low, and pasting it from other sites is always a pain in the ass. Honestly, since it's a novel, I'd just put a link to an imgur page with the gif file among all the other text and just tell the reader the link is to an animation. Maybe also put a clickable link the description as well""]",5/6/2019 9:30,,,,,,,,,

631,Layer Troubleshooting,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello.
I am trying to get into both Krita and Medibang, but I am having a lot of trouble managing layers. One thing that's bothering me is that when I try to stack one on top of another in Krita, nothing happens, and I can't change the layer that needs to be on top to plain white.

For some reason my Likes and Subscribers say “Go!” instead of having numbers. And my Activity is showing me that I have a new Subscriber even tho said Subscriber has been subscribed to my comic for a while now.
Also the stats thing I circled in the first image is counting them as a new subscriber as well.
May or may not be related but I also lost a Subscriber. They may have just unsubscribed but given all this it seems too coincidental to me.
It also isn’t telling me who Liked my pages in the Activity section. See how it says 5 Likes in the first image? But it’s not showing up in the Activity thing, even when I click to see all my Activity it doesn’t show me.
Anyone else having this issue? If it matters, I’m using the browser on my phone. 
Oh also the views stats seem to be all over the place lately.

659,A complaint about tapas notifications,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"@STAFF  recently there's been something that was bothering me about the notifications on tapas: if I respond to a post on somebody else's wall, it will notify me for every single response that person's post gets. I find it unneccesary and misleading. I realized that it was just like something on instagram where I'll get notified if ""someone else commented on so and so's post"". could you maybe remove this feature or have an option for us to disable it without unsubscribing to their series or blocking them? I don't think it's been helpful to other users either, but I could be wrong about that.
another suggestion is if you could add a feature to @ mention or directly reply to people on wall posts. the @ mention would be to message more than one person at a time like you can on here.","[""I kinda like the feature TBH, sometimes it can keep you in the loop of an ongoing conversation, like for example sometimes they actually are responding to you (it's just that there's technically no option to reply to specific people after the initial comment). \nBut yeah, I can see how it could get annoying. A settings option would be better than outright removing it IMO."", 'Also I think that would be easier if we have specific reply function, or just be able to mention someone on the wall comments ', 'yeah, or they could just add a feature where you can directly reply to someone or multiple people at a time and just notify you for that, OR have an option for how you want to be notified. err, looks like @kainatarma already said it', ""Yeah, although I can also see why they wouldn't want to do that, since it might get a bit weird to have so many nested replies sometimes.

I don't think it happens with the comics themselves."", ""Ohh, I am getting it now. The ability to tag/mention people does seem really useful.

661,Huion Tablet Opinions? (My cintiq 3-in-1 cord broke),Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"My 13HD Cintiq fell from my desk and while it's fine, the cord was forcibly pulled out and broke. I bent it back into shape and the tablet works, but it wont stay in the port properly anymore. (Like a bad cell phone cord experience.) 
I can't find a replacement cord easily and apparently Wacom is known to never have any available (they're currently out of stock.) I do digital art daily and my comic is really important to me, so I'm looking for alternatives but don't really want to invest more in wacom while my 1300$ tablet is unusable because they don't stock their important accessories 
SO. Huion. I've heard endless mixed things about them in the past, but they've come out with tablets in the past while so I'm curious if they're a better alternative now? I'll be looking up reviews as well obviously, but I'm wary of paid reviews (many i see have been sent a tablet from huion, which makes me nervous they're saying good things because its a free product?) and am interested in hearing from people a community i'm more familiar with.
If you've used a cintiq and huion, i'd love to hear your opinion especially since I know the surfaces can feel different and whatnot. 
ALSO if you're a wacom user with a broken tablet but have a spare cord lying around??? Hit me up if youre interested in selling it 
***EDIT:** I've found them in stock on the wacom store, but they don't ship to Canada apparently?","['It\'s time to upgrade your tablet.  I couldn\'t find that cable anywhere too.\nThis display tablet is nearly has the same quality as Cintiq Pro 13, and better than Cintiq 13HD.https://www.huiontablet.com/kamvas-pro-13.html38Or you can buy a used Cintiq Pro 13 for about 600-800 usd.\nWacom is greedy because they still have the best graphic tablets in the market right now. Huion have to sacrificed something to justify their profit, there always be some trade off from the cheap brand tablet.\n\nYou can\'t custom the color profile from hardware (by using software), which mean you can\'t keep your color calibration after you connected it to a new laptop or PC.\nThe driver is really messy, but usable.\nHigher defected rate, but good customer services, so it\'s a lottery.\nThe build quality feels really cheap and out of date.\nRight now, they\'re on the ""quality revolution"" period, their products are improving so fast, your tablet will feel obsolete after 6 months or so.\n\n--\nI\'m using a Cintiq Pro 13. Here\'s something that most of reviewer missed in their review:\n\n\nNo parallax, the pen has wider pressure range to be customized.\nThe feeling when holding the device on my hand is really premium and good looking.\nThe screen surface is nearly perfect, might never scratched or weared off, unlike the old Cintiq devices.\nI got a scratch last week, an hour of drawing later, the scratch disabled like magic.\nI bought mine from my artist friend, he had used it everyday for a year and the screen surface is still brand new like he never used it. He had to show mutiple weared pen tips in the box, to prove how much he had used it.\n\nThe Hard-Felt Nibs for Pro Pen 2 wears down pretty fast. But it has an organic feel that you can\'t find it from other brands, so I think it worth it.\nIt\'s has the warm area that feels really nice on a cold day, or in a room with AC. I kinda like it.\n\nAbout the technical stuffs:\n\nCustomer services isn\'t the best.\nThe driver isn\'t perfect, but is better than other brand on technical aspect.\nIt\'s has 3 USB-C ports, an SDcard reader and a 3.5 audiojack.\nIt needs 1 port for power and 1 port for data.\nData cable can be used as 1 single USB-C on most laptop nowaday.\nIf your devices don\'t have the USB-C that support it, you will need to use the Wacom Link (included) to split the USB-C cable to USB-A, and Display Port or HDMI. \n\nBecause of USB-C, in theory it can be powered by a portable 30W powerbank. I\'m waiting for my powerbank to test this features right now.\n\nDid I mention it uses USB-C yet? It has no unusual port at all, fully future proof.\n', 'I really like my huion, I\'ve had it for about a year now. I decided I was never buying another wacom because their customer service is so bad, I\'d rather have better support and less features. I have this one (gt 191 ) https://www.amazon.co.uk/Graphics-Drawing-Monitor-Pressure-Display/dp/B073S3YQSV#23It\'s really good for what it is. Obviously it\'s missing some features wacom has, hot keys and a double sided pen with buttons and a battery (wacom has a patent on those so no other company can do battery pens). The charge in the pen lasts a long time and they sent me 2 so while 1 charges I use the other one. The pressure levels are fine, every tablet I\'ve used has more at the light range and less at the heavy range but this one is better balanced. The screen was horrible to draw on, really scratchy and unpleasant, so I had to buy a screen protector because the one they give you is only held on at the corners. I got a custom made one from upscreen that fits perfectly and made it 100 times easier to draw. I had to calibrate the colours a lot to make them accurate because when I got it it was on the ""warm"" setting but there\'s the standard options for that so it wasn\'t too bad. The stand is pretty sturdy and grippy, I don\'t really worry about that. I\'ve had less problems with the drivers than I did with my wacom or my last huion. In fact I\'m not sure I\'ve ever had any driver issues with this one in the year I\'ve had it. So there\'s my thoughts. Honestly for less than half the price of a cintiq I don\'t really miss the wacom features.

But it's thick + the screen => the pen is a little distance from the actual drawing surface, and it's kind of foggy, kind of make the color look slightly dull and blurry  ( not that much, but you feel it ), I tried put the screen protector away and draw directly on the screen, but it became slippery, and my poor soul feel uneasy striking my pen directly on the luxury screen so I put the screen protector back.

I love the new INK system on tapas and the possibility of readers/supporters to add a comment to the given Ink.

It's kinda weird because I still can scroll down to the very first support message on other people's profiles and read them (because you get there through the support link on the profile and it's another kind of system?) ... but not my own.

What I do and manage to get my coins for the day the fastest I can is:- I tap on a comic that can be tipped and tap on ""Tip""- This is where I tap on the yellow ""Free coins"" button and I watch an ad- when it is finished and I go back and I see my coins go up, I DO NOT tap the yellow button right away again because I\'ve noticed that many times the next ad that becomes available is a broken one, so instead I tap back and tap on ""Tip"" button again and then on the yellow button because I think that this gives the system the time it needs (just those 2-3 seconds) to load an ad that works.\nBy doing this I had successfully minimized the number of broken ads I get in a 12-15 minutes watching session to just 3 at max.\nBut since we\'re on the subject of ads, and I don\'t know if you know but as soon as you watch all your ads for the day you get them again 24 hours after you watched your first one for the day and they do not become available before that, and so everyday I set an alarm for the next day\'s ads because even if you are over your phone all day, the time the ads become available inevitably shifts later and later each day.Today though, just today and this is the first time it has happened to me, I\'m at least 3 hours after the time my ads were supposed to be available again (I watched my first at 15:33 yesterday, watched all in a matter of 15 minutes and I\'ve been trying to get a working ad since 15:34 today and now it is 18:20) and I either get broken ones or it says that there are no available ads at this time.\n-_-\n...\nSo what is happening??? ', ""No idea since the staff did not responded to any thread about this ads failure (or maybe they did and I'm not seeing it).

The watch-to-earn feature is ""working"" on the Tapas side, in that the button can be tapped to see an ad and earn coins when an ad is available in your location, on your platform (i.e. Android, iOS, web).  The videos and other offers, along with the resulting coin reward amounts, are provided by advertiser networks, not Tapas directly. Unfortunately, we don\'t control where in the world advertisers want to show ads, nor how much they\'re willing to pay…', ""@daronakira No, not only there's an problem with the availability, but there is a glitch where the ads we watched won't give us any coins. In other threads, I stated that I watched at least 50(or 80, I don't remember) and only get 200 coins. The other 30 is not delivered, and that's have been happening for almost a godd*mn 2 months.\nIf I re-downloading it, I'm able to earn some coins before it's either said no ads available (I haven't been able to get ads for almost a month, where before this happened I'll be able to scrap around 100 coins a day if I'm lucky) or the ads I'm watching didn't delivering the coins (we've all had this problem, not only the ads availability).\nI wish you'll see more about this problem."", ""Correct, I mentioned that in my linked response as well... it's in the third paragraph and was just not included in the preview above. \nRecently (at least for the past several weeks), the service that provided most of the ads and rewards for ads outside of the US was often not giving out the coin rewards after someone finished watching a video, seeing an app/game ad, etc., which was super frustrating and obviously unfair. At Tapas there was no way for us to tell when this was happening, as the ad network basically just tells us after a reward has been given out. Since it was failing on the ad network's end, we didn't earn anything from those ads, which is what normally gets converted directly into the coins that are given out as a reward. When it became clear that this was happening more often than not, we disabled the network causing the problems, since sitting through a 30 second video and then not getting the reward you deserve is worse than not having a video available at all."", 'Ok, thanks for clearing things out.', ""I've been having the same issue as well since Tuesday. So there's nothing much we can do but to just wait it out?"", 'I think that at this point re-enabling the service would be better. I haven\'t been able to watch any ads for the last two weeks. The chapters I purchase with the coins I get are what is valuable to me, more than the time it gets me to earn those coins. Yes a lot of times I would end up watching ads and get nothing but it never took me more than 30 minutes to do so. I figured that there was a daily limit to the COINS I could earn but not to the number of ads that became available, so after I got my coins I knew better to stop watching any more ads because they would always be broken from that point on. I had also found a way to minimize the number of broken ads I got by not tapping on the ""earn coins"" button directly after an ad but going back and then tapping on ""Free coins"" again because I noticed that the next ad to be loaded in this ""delayed"" way would have more possibilities to be a working one. Now though I have run out of coins and I\'m not financially in a position to start buying them until the premium comics I love reach their end.  and I\'m unfortunately in Europe, not the US.

724,Help setting a novel to NSFW,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I recently started publishing a novel here, titled Grave of Heroes.  The majority of the novel is appropriate for all audiences, but it does use the term ""bastard"" to refer to an illegitimate child, and there are graphic descriptions of violence in fight scenes that likely are not suitable to all audiences.

726,Read vs unread unlocked chapters,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello!
I'm posting this because as a reader I find it not so much user friendly to have a freshly unlocked chapter appear as read as soon as I unlock its next one even though I didn't actually read it but just tapped it to unlock it. That app behavior creates a problem with ""wait to unlock"" series that I can unlock but don't want to read at that time. The time to unlock another chapter comes and I'm forced to tap to unlock one and then go back and tap to the one I read last so that I know where I left it. And all the unlocked but unread chapters after that appear as read. I remember when each chapter had a little green key icon on the right and you could unlock it without opening it or when a chapter wouldn't appear as read if you hadn't reached its last panel. So I'm just posting this hoping that you'll get that issue under consideration. Maybe hoarding keys for ""wait to unlock"" series, or even all premium series, and using them when you actually want to read a chapter would be useful? Or at least not greying a chapter in the list by just tapping on it?

740,Arranging Episodes?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"This may not belong in Tech Support but I'm not sure where to post it.
This I'm sure has been asked before but I'm going to ask anyways. What's up with the lack of ability to move or arrange Episodes around with the comics? For example if I have 3 episodes I'm unable to move the episodes around or arrange them. The only way to really do it is to post material specifically on the episode itself or just delete and re-post them in the order you want.
Unless I'm missing something and this is possible and if so, please educate my foolish self.
But it's surprising that some lesser comic sites will automatically have this kind of feature, to the point where it seems necessary but a big comic hosting site like Tapastic, probably the biggest I've seen so far doesn't. I'm not sure if its something the site creator has to work on but I can't be the only one who finds this lack of episode arrangement bothersome.
I'm sure this has happened to a lot of people. You're working on your comic and then you realize you got to add something new before or you want to change things up.

Hope it helps, and thanks for the help too.\n', 'Glad you found a solution!\nThis may also be a possible reason: You saved your file in CMYK format, which can make the colors look really off. This is because CMYK is a color mode used for printing, not screens. It can appear dull or de-saturated. I\'ve even run into a situation where I attached a CMYK file in a message to someone and it looked neon. Once I changed it to RGB mode, it was fine.\nNot sure what program you\'re using to create your file, but you need to make sure that you\'re working in ""RGB mode"", which is the color mode for anything that is meant to appear digitally ie on a computer screen.\nWhen you saved it as a PNG, it is automatically converted it to RGB for you because PNG files can only ever be saved in RGB mode. JPG files can be either CMYK or RGB. \nOne thing to note is saving as a PNG can increase the file size, so that\'s something to keep in mind if you\'re trying to keep file sizes low.

744,Cintiq display problems,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hi !So I Bought the new cintiq pro 13hd that came out not so long ago (January)and I have had many MANY problems with it. I am going to skip a few problems that found a solutions like I had to buy a new computer for the tablet to work ... yes yes I lost an arm worth of money in the process
10 days ago the tablet displayed on it's screen "" no signal"" I was rather surprised since the day before it was working perfectly and I had not changed a thing on my desk, the cables where plugged the same way, the only thing that I did between the day before and that day was turning off my computer and tablet and turning it on in the morning.PANIC OF COURSE And I couldn't work for 3 days because nothing worked, got late in my projects, I obviously contacted wacom to see how they could help ( lemme tell you they could not )But the most magical thing happenned on Monday morning when the tablet just turned on and worked like nothing had happened. 
I happilly worked to this day, when the exact same thing happenned again this morning. The tablet said no signal. And refuse to display my desktop.Wacom insist that it is a graphic card problem, wich I do not believe since the tablet worked perfectly so far ( well exept for these 2 mysterious events ... )
The only solution for them is to make me pay for the repair/send them the tablet by mail.I feel like rather then spending more money ( wich I don't have ) just send the tablet back and get refunded. 
What do you think ? I also have a hope that there a tiny box to check for it to work in some obscure parameters that I don't know. If one of you have a solution I will be in your debt until the end of times ! And if I can get my tablet to work even do a commission for you !

While a year is a long time for slump, the reason you hear about it a lot is because it is a real thing that happens. (I don’t meant to sound harsh!

I can't even think of them right now but someone else probably can.\nYou could also use projectwonderful if you are willing to invest money in advertising your comic.\nAside from that, my biggest advice is keep posting, keep improving, keep engaging, don't spam any walls or fake friendships just to get exposure. Those are the key points and don'ts (some people who are desparate for subs screw themselves over fast by advertising themselves on other people's profiles and it may generate a few subs but basically screws their entire chance of gaining any significant fanbase since people just find it annoying).Your tapas profile is just about a year old and your dA profile is a few months. I don't know if you've been regularily posting anywhere else since before that, but if not you're still just in the starting phase. I had way fewer subs when I was just 1 year into posting my art online.Subs will grow exponentially with your every project if you just keep going, post regularily, improve and keep observing the business.

Unfortunately, we don\'t control where in the world advertisers want to show ads, nor how much they\'re willing to pay as a reward. \nRecently (at least for the past several weeks), the service that provided most of the ads and rewards for ads outside of the US was often not giving out the coin rewards after someone finished watching a video, seeing an app/game ad, etc., which was super frustrating and obviously unfair. At Tapas there was no way for us to tell when this was happening, as the ad network basically just tells us after a reward has been given out. Since it was failing on the ad network\'s end, we didn\'t earn anything from those ads, which is what normally gets converted directly into the coins that are given out as a reward. When it became clear that this was happening more often than not, we disabled the network causing the problems, since sitting through a 30 second video and then not getting the reward you deserve is worse than not having a video available at all.\nWe\'re looking for better ad partners to provide free coins to more of our community (especially those outside the US), both in the form of video ads and other offers (like trying games, apps, etc.).

So, I've been having this issue for... 3 or 4 weeks? I don't know if I am unconsciously unsubscribing from the comics, or I never subscribed to them in the first place. To be honest, I'm getting kind of paranoid right now.  
A few weeks ago, I was surfing on the Fresh, Trending, and Popular page, then I found a comic that I stopped reading because I wanted to give it more time to update. So, I decided "" sure, let's read this one, it's been awhile since I gave it a look "", and when I was done reading, I noticed I wasn't subscribed to it, but I ignored it, because maybe I hadn't ( hadn't? Is that correct? ) in the first place.
This is been happening since then. It happened again a few days ago, and TODAY I'm 80% sure that my memory is not as bad as I think it is, because I just found a comic that I KNOW I subscribed, but when I clicked on it, I wasn't in my library.

Just look at it\'s amount of subscribers, that was no incident that a lot of people subbing despite it is being new. I don\'t think I even give this site a chance if it were not for said comic above. It turns out disappointing when I found out the searching issue is just the same as webtoon, even though not as bad, it still bad. I don\'t even feel like spending any dime atm because all I did in this site is browse all the time, not much consumption.\nI want to believe there are a lot of comics with good stories that fit my taste over here in tapas, I believe there is, but all I see are plotless feeling-feeling-touchy story between pretty boys. I have nothing against it, but it is just something I don\'t read.\nJust for reference, these are comic I enjoys the most:Vagabond-Takehiko InoueBerserk-Kentaro MiuraGantz-Oku hiroyaDeath note-Ohba tsugumiAttack on titan-Isayama hajimeBtooom!, Ajin, etc etc..\nbasically story with serious plots. Whisper of the True King gave me the same vibe, so thank god for that.\nNote: I\'m just a reader, not a creator, I noticed that a lot of activity in the forum are mostly creators, so just fyi.', ""\n\nmisaeotai:\nI've been using Tapas like about 2-3 weeks now, I find myself just skip the feature page, because it always the same thing.\nThat's how I feel, too, so I was really hoping the feed would or could be different. Alas, it's just another way to have the same stories shoved down our throats. As you said, if I didn't read it when it was on the front page or in the Daily Snack, putting it in the feed isn't going to make me read it more. It will actually have the opposite effect. \n\n\nmisaeotai:\nNote: I'm just a reader, not a creator, I noticed that a lot of activity in the forum are mostly creators, so just fyi\n Thank you for posting your thoughts.

Part of that is because of the way my updates are right now though, but comparing impressions and revenue from similar days prior to mid august, I still see at least a 50% drop.\nJust like with the youtube ad issues, advertisers will only pay as much as they feel an ad space is worth, they will only do it if they like the ad space to begin with and feel that it is profitable, and we all just have to bite our tongues and deal because honestly the advertisers aren't obliged to invest money in us at all.

CPM at the start of the month for our series was around $.18.  If it\'s now $.09/CPM then Tapas needs to do something about its ad network because that number is way too low.  If you look at the ad decks of other websites the CPMs are mind boggling in comparison.  A CPM of $10 is a very common number but we\'ve seen as high as $80.  Hiveworks openly reports on their website that their CPM is $2 and that\'s fairly low compared to what Crunchyroll asks.\nAt one time we tried repeatedly with Google AdWords to get ads to run on Tapas but could never make it happen, even bidding as high as $.50/CPM, and calling them on four different occasions, so there must be some sort of disconnect.\nPerhaps Tapas should consider selling ad space directly to Tapas series?  \nPerhaps they should convert one of the desktop ad boxes to Project Wonderful?  \nCould they add an ""advertising"" section to their homepage and try to get some $2 or $10 CPMs like many other websites are receiving?  Could they hire a marketing consultant to attract more advertisers?\nSince ad revenue is for some creators the only form of income on Tapas, this definitely deserves some looking into to see if there can be improvements.  The traffic that Tapas.io generates is quite significant and shouldn\'t be given away.', ""I wouldn't protest at all if the ad revenue is improved because that's a win win for everyone, however considering the amount of changes Tapas has officially announced they are about to introduce it is possible that the CPM drop isn't first priority right now.\nI do trust your statistics and experience, and I hope staff notices this thread and attempts to make a change as soon as they get on it. If you are seriously telling me that all creators on this site and Tapas as a company could be making 10 times as much as we were making BEFORE the CPM drop, when we are now instead down by 50%, then that's nothing to sneeze at.\nImproving the CPM could also help tapas improve itself as a competitor to webtoons.

I\'ve seen users here make long episodes that have like 25-30 pages fit altogether seamlessly into one large episode. In my case, I had to fuse two pages (37 and 38 I believe it was) of Chapter 4 together for my comic Life of an Aspie in order to be able to fit in a notice I created at the start of the chapter for new readers. What I did was open the finished files for the two corresponding pages, copy, cut, and paste one of them into the other file, and then play around with the size settings for both ""layers"" until it looked good enough to publish with the reader being none the wiser as to the fact it was two pages sharing the space of one.\nAnother thing you can always consider is when working on a new chapter of your comic is to simply condense it down to fit under the allotted 40 page limit per episode anyway. Some plot events that I envisioned before for LoaA that would have taken up a few pages either got condensed down to just a couple of pages or were cut altogether if I felt they didn\'t fit in with the tone of the chapter or the overall story. As a result my shortest chapter is about roughly 34 pages (not counting the cover, content warnings, or the acknowledgements page) on average and 38 pages for my longest at the most. \nHope this helps. ', ""When I started on Tapas I had an existing comic with four completed chapters, and I started by putting each one into its own episode. I later went back and completely reorganised the completed pages into short episodes of about 5-8 page scenes, and the reception from readers was very positive.\nYou can't think of Tapas episodes as corresponding to chapters. They're meant to be short, and the 40 image limit is to allow for for the Korean-style comics with lots of space between vertically-placed panels. Cramming lots of pages into one episode makes it hard for people to keep track of as they're reading through your archives. Shorter episodes mean they can pick up where they left off without having to scroll through a wall of images trying to work out the last page they read."", 'TBH it would be really helpful if Tapas could increase the limit. I public on both tapas and webtoon at the same time with around 40+ pages per updates (each page has 1-2 panels) splitting an episode into 2 to update at the same time make them feel disconnected to me but sometimes the site left me no other choice. I could possible sit down and combine several page into a longer strip each, but that require extra work after I already organized all the pages together and how I want them to flow  I wish they could do like Webtoon, instead of having page limit, just have data limit (20Mb in webtoon case)', 'In both cases, I find Tapas and Webtoon are more consistent with bite sized stories rather than large form.

843,Can’t change the look of the “Share Thumbnail” - A bug?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hi,
I'm having problems when I upload new episodes. I can't change the look of the ""Share Thumbnail"". Every time I click on the ""use this"" button, the thumbnail won't change into the image that I chose. It resets to default... or just can't process the command 
At first, I thought it was a connection problem. I tried uploading episodes on different connections, but it won't work. Not at home, not at my workplace nor at my friends' places. Could it be a bug? Are others experiencing the same problem?
It's been like this for a couple of weeks. It was never a problem before  I've sent an email about it before, but I'm not sure if it arrived or if it got lost in the feed which is understandable (after the Incubator submission and all. There must be tons of emails). So I decided to write about it here in the Forum instead. I'm not usually active here, so I'm not sure if it's the right place. Let me know!

English is not my first language)","[""It's not a bug (kinda).\nIf you post an episode and try to change the share thumbnail after you've posted it, Tapas won't let you because of something to do with Facebook and Twitter and it's overly complicated to change the share thumbnail after you've posted it I think.\nIf you really want to, I think you can just create a new episode and then change the thumbnail, just don't schedule or publish the episode before you're done changing the thumbnail."", '@Evan I get your point, but this happens when I create new episodes as well ', ""Hmm...

Could the $1 come out of the dashboard?

Some creators would even re-invest that $1 CPM into running ads for their series being on Tapas which means even more readers for Tapas.\n$1 CPM definitely seems within the realm of possibilities given that Hiveworks is getting somewhere between $1 and $2 CPM.  They advertise on their website they sell ads for $2 CPM but from what we've found out digging around it's more between $1.25 and $1.50, so $1 CPM for Tapas feels doable.\nToo bad we can't get what writers on Seeking Alpha get: $10 CPM.\n\n\nLordVincent:\nOH GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE\nYou're not.

So, I'm not exactly new to Tapas (Been here long before you changed the name from Tapastic), but let's say it's been long since I entered the site. 
So, my problem is exactly as it says in the title: I cannot use the site of Tapas... Barely.
I can only open comics, but the bar of the episodes shows blank, I cannot advance through episodes, nor I can move to the first episode; I cannot add comics to my library, or add comments, nor extend the comments to see more; I cannot access my account, nor my library, nor my notifications... I think you get it.
In short: I cannot perform any action within the page, unless it involves charging a full new page, like opening a comic or entering Tapas main page itself.
I have been having this problem for longer than a week and I really wanted to come back to Tapas and read the updates... And this is the only page that is causing me this problem (Not charging any HTML5 actions I think?), so I decided to report this problem and see if you could help me.
I use Windows 10, Chrome updated, and I own a gaming PC, so I doubt is a problem with my PC. I've been out of the page for more than a year, so I not exactly sure if the problem is longer than a week. I also don't own the app because I don't have a smartphone.

As for michaelson, I guess he was wrong.\nThe percentage they take can be found in the Terms of Service (while I know most people don't read it, it is important and should at least be given a glance over to make sure you're not handing the ownership of your content to them, they even have a search option to help you look for anything specific in the ToS) which is public and you have to agree to and not particularly hidden. I will agree that showing where and when the fees are being deducted would be nice though.\nThe majority of your revenue is from tips, however, if you do a little math, you'll find that about $4.25 of ad revenue is enough to tip the percentage that Tapas takes overall to your 17%.For Kyulein, I don't know where his balance has gone but it's definitely odd for that much to be taken up in fees. Maybe they don't apply fees in one go like we're using for calculations which leads to more fees than what we calculate or the reason Tapas doesn't allow you to transfer funds before $25 is because the percentage they take only becomes 30% at a certain point. Tips still take 30 days to process, but will still count towards the current balance, but judging from earlier posts, that's probably not it.\nTransparency is usually good and it would be nice to know exactly what fees are being charged and for how much.\nFor your coin math,\n\nGot a Tipping Comic? Share here!\n\nCoin values fluctuate based on where they're acquired from - i.e. coins from the coin shop are impacted by the in-app fees from Google and Apple, while coins from video ads are not. Instead, we translate the coin value directly to $USD in your revenue dashboard.There was a better post about this, but I can't find it.

Last I checked 50 coins equals .04 cents.  50 tapas coins = .04 cents\n\nHow many views do I need to make 1 dollar?\n\nYes, CPM is rapidly decaying due to the increasing use of adblock which shows no signs in dropping.  Also users are increasingly less and less likely to notice an ad, let alone click on it, which requires advertisers to buy 1,000s of impressions to deliver a single click.  Multiply that by the fact that it takes 20 or 30 clicks to result in a sale, and ad values rapidly decrease even more.

Share here!\n\nPersonally, I estimate that 100 coins roughly equals $.08  1,250 coins roughly equals $1.00 USD  However, artists get about 55% of revenue from coins bought in the store (30% to app fees 15% to Tapas for hosting). So keep in mind if a reader pays $5 worth of coins to tip you, you're only getting $2.75 of that. I recommend tippers donate to patreons/paypals instead of buying coins and to earn coins instead by watching ads, since artists get about 80-85% from that.  This is all just rough num…and might actually explain why 36% of Kyulein's balance is gone.\nMoving on, if Tapas does take a total of 30% of the money from tips, 70/30 is actually a pretty good split, so it's not like they're trying to scam you and you still get the majority of the money in all cases.\nAbout their transparency:They make money by selling ad space and coins (probabaly anyways) and it probably wouldn't be hard to find the company's official tax returns online somewhere or a few statistics of how much their making.I agree that they could be more transparent about where and when they're deducting fees, but they're probably not hiding them on purpose. It might take a while to implement something to show you what fees are being deducted though, programming can be harder than you think, but if a developer or staff member can tell us exactly which fees we have to pay at least, that'd be great.As for the exchange rate from coins to real money, it's always changing and it would be hard to implement any real-time system to show an accurate aproximation of the exchange rate of free coins and bought coins to real money.\nI agree that knowing exactly how fees are being calculated and deducted is important although it may take some time before anything is really implemented (programming is difficult).\nBut even if Tapas was, for example, unfairly taking 50% of the profits, you're still earning 50% of the profits whereas taking what you have now and deleting your account would exclude you from any future earnings with Tapas.30% is pretty standard when it comes to splitting between developers and hosting places. Apple, Google play, and Windows split the profit between app developers and themselves 70/30 which is how Tapas claims it does with their content creators. YouTube actually supposedly takes a whole 45% of the ad revenue their creators make.But if you still feel like all companies are trying to rip you off, you might want to consider Patreon where they amazingly only take around 5% in total for processing, however, they're very different from Tapas (mainly that they're a crowdfunding site), but one thing to note is that earning coins with Tapas is free and ad revenue is basically free money for creators whereas you need people with actual money to support you on Patreon."", ""\n\nEvan:\nIt might take a while to implement something to show you what fees are being deducted though, programming can be harder than you think\nWe're not staff either but we have to imagine that the pile of things for coders to do at Tapas is huge.  We're fairly certain that there will be more details about transparency on the back end in the future but TBH, that's fairly low on the priority list.  Many people are asking for things like desktop tipping and coin purchase which would be huge revenue generators for the site, so they are much higher on the list.  Right now Tapas has to give 30% of every $1 in revenue to Google/Apple.  Once they can establish desktop purchases w/ a normal merchant transaction account they will be paying around 3 to 5% (depending on Debit/Credit/Premium Credit Rewards Cards -- that 2% cash back Citi rewards card really ads up the fees), which means that creators could get 80% of purchased coin tips vs. the currrent 55%.  It would still be 55% though for tipped coin purchases through the app.\nAs you can see it does make things very complex which it why more transparency is likely on the way.  However since there are such huge changes coming down the line in terms of creator revenue, it's like trying to hit a moving target.\nWe figure once all the major changes are complete staff will then dial it in to make it much more easy to see what revenue is coming from where and what the individual fees are.\nThat said, back when tipping first happened, each tip was individually logged and available to be seen on your dashboard.  This quickly became very server intensive because we for example kept tipping a series 25 coins at a time 100s of times and it started to really lag the system.  If 100s of tippers started doing that all at once... Eventually staff just rolled all tips into one daily line item in order to reduce the stress on their servers.  So there comes a point where transparency and practicality have to meet somewhere in the middle.\nTapas isn't out to screw anyone.  They have far more at stake than we creators do with at least $4.4M of private equity on the line.https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tapas-media#/entity2 They're a business giving creators a way to earn income from what they love doing and they get a cut of creator revenue for the convenience of not having to: A) creating and maintaining your own website B) installing and maintaining an ad server C) creating a way to get tips D) creating your own app E) attracting 550,000 app downloads (readers) F) attracting 9M monthly homepage views...\nIt's a pretty fair arrangement."", 'Oof long responses.\nLet me just preface by saying I respect Tapastic\'s right to do whatever they want as a business. My primarily complaint is about lack of transparency, lack of clarity about what they\'re doing with ""my"" money, and misleading tools and statements about how they\'re ""supporting creators"".\nCould they totally decide to take a 50% cut of everything? Sure. But that\'s not what they said. They take 30% of microtransactions (purchased coins) and ad revenue, and 15% of tips. Since the vast majority (recent survey estimate like 85%+) of tips come from coins earned from watching ads, it\'s fair to ask how much of the money from ads they\'re taking UP FRONT and then taking a 15% from the creator ON TOP of that. It could be that they\'re totally perfect and fair and taking next to no profit at that step, and just taking from the creators. Or they could be double dipping. I\'m assuming they\'re not taking a loss at the ads->coins conversion step.\nThey can legally do whatever they want, and maybe it even is a good deal compared to other options. But if they\'re saying/implying one thing and doing another, I find that problematic. They don\'t have a great history of transparency, thus my pushing for some.\nWith regards to my balance at apparent 17% (not 15%) fees, and maybe that including ad fees, I don\'t think so. Ad fees are calculated and deducted as you go AND NEVER SHOW UP IN ""CURRENT BALANCE"".\n\nCapture.JPG947x273 16.5 KB\n\nI earned 7 cents of ad revenue, had 2 cents of fees deducted, and my Current Balance only went of 5 cents.\nThat\'s how I would LIKE fees to be handled. Nice and obviously, showing up in a record like this and not making it into my Current Balance\nInstead of being mysteriously deducted from my ""Available Balance"" with no accounting of the math that adds it up. \nFor me, at least, the missing % is close enough to 15, and the vast majority of my Balance is from earned coin tips, so I accept that probably is the reason for the perceived discrepancy. But the underlying problem still is transparency and accounting.\nI accept that ad value fluctuates, but coin value should not. Why is there not a constant (public) exchange rate between the value of a coin and the amount a creator gets when tipped? Why not account for the 15% cut there, instead of making a creator think they\'re getting more than they are? Something simple like ""150 coins means the creator gets 10 cents"" or whatever, instead of tipping a nebulous amount, seeing it turn into an amount of pennies through secret math, and THEN having another cut taking from the top?\nFor purchased coins, I get the microtransaction 30% cut that the app entails (which I do not believe applies to payouts to creators). That 30% should be factored into the amount of coins earned, and not create a type of coin that earns less to creators after being tipped.\nAs is, it seems the intent is to purposefully obfuscate the amount that is actually being transferred between supporter and creator. Tipping 100 coins sounds awesome, until you learn that the creator gets 8 cents from that, oh wait, take 15% off, 6.5 cents.\nTransparency.\nAnd @GoldenPlume, I A) Already have my own website, B) Can run ads on my own site at greater profits via Project Wonderful if I wished, C) Have Patreon, paypal, etc, which take much smaller cuts and earn a lot more, D) Don\'t need an app, any browser works, E/F) the difficulties of getting any of that attention even when you\'re updating daily is a well known problem with Tapastic, especially with their shift to Premium content.\nThey can do their own thing, but lets not pretend everything they do is perfect and wonderful.  At the moment, I\'d just be happy for some transparency around the money they claim is mine.\nEDIT: Tested tipping just now. 1200 coins equals a dollar showing up in the creator\'s backend. But then I guess 15% comes off of that, so the true rate is 1200 coins = 85 cents. So a little over 14 cents per penny. Just make that happen up front (or account for the fees in the activity and fees history page) instead of mysteriously deducting it from ""available balance"", please!', '\nScreen Shot 2017-07-30 at 4.10.47 PM.png1673x214 25.2 KB\n\nApologies, I was incorrect. This is what I saw on our backend, but after discussing with Yoon, we have since added the ""What is the difference between Current Balance and Available Balance?"". \nThe fees associated w/ tipping varies based on how the coins are acquired (i.e. which coin pack they were purchased from or if they were acquired through watching video ads). But we will work on adding more transparency to this section in the future. \nThanks for the feedback.', 'Thanks for the response, Michael. So weird that on your end ALL of it is still ""available"". That term still confuses me I guess.', 'So I\'m still figuring out how to put this into words, because ""raving mad"" doesn\'t even begin to cover my current state of mind when thinking of Tapas.\nThat Tapas takes some cuts from both tip and ad revenue is a given, they\'re a business, they have costs and they want to make profit. To make it clear: that is absolutely okay and not the slightest reason of my being mad at them.\nBUT my balance is showing that I HAVE $37.27 and barely 2/3 of that actually find the way out of the pipeline. Roughly $13 are being danlged in front of my nose like a dog\'s treat via the ""Current Balance"". Given that no fees are logged in the ""Activities and Fees"" tab I don\'t find it hard to believe that those $37.27 are what I should get out of my account.For all I know any kind of cut (like those mentioned in the ToS) could\'ve been applied before the tip ever made it to my account. Again given that no fees are logged anywhere for me to check that I feel that it is a valid assumption.\nIt\'s nice that in hindsight they admit to transparency issues. The damage is done, though. Neither will I get my sanity nor my time wasted on this issue back. The emails I wrote haven\'t gotten the grace of an answer, so even if the forum is community driven, it seems it\'s easier to get a hold of the official people here than through their official channel. It was the forums that provided me with an answer after several months of trying to get in touch.\nNo amount of work that goes into my own website and other revenue streams has ever frustrated and stressed me as much as my time on Tapas.', ""A couple of things to point out:\nIf you are getting a bunch of your revenue from tips where people are buying the coins, 45% of that is going to disappear, 30% to Google/Apple and 15% to Tapas.  That there would explain why there is a big gap.\nAlso all ad revenue is held for 30 days because some creators in the past decided to buy bots to crawl their comics to run up the ad impressions and pocket the difference between what Tapas paid and what they paid the bots.  Because of that, now all ad revenue is held for 30 days so Tapas can investigate and take action against any creators who try to do the same thing.  So if you have gotten a large run up in ad revenue it won't show for a month.\nNot sure who you are sending emails to, but if you are sending messages to Michael Son, he's extremely busy and its pretty hard to get an answer from him on things.  Also its the weekend."", 'Sorry to make you confused.. The view that Michael shared is one of our admin pages and it hasn\'t update after we added the tipping feature. That\'s why the balance and available are the same. \nInstead of being mysteriously deducted from my ""Available Balance"" with no accounting of the math that adds it up.\nYou can see some details of ""Available Balance"" when you click ""Request Transfer"". \n\nimage.png1314x984 79.3 KB\n\nThat\'s how I would LIKE fees to be handled. Nice and obviously, showing up in a record like this and not making it into my Current Balance\nCalculating Tipping revenue is a little more complicated than Ad-revenue. For now there are 2 sources of coins for tipping and each of them have different a amount of fees. (it will be 3 when we introduce coin shop for the web.). Store coins has 30% fees and Earned coins(users can earned from video ad and etc.) has 0% fees. Also as you know, there is 15% tapas share fees. If we do math each record for fees then there might be some ""round-off errors""(it depends on amounts.) So we don\'t math each record. Instead, we do math when you request transfer money.\nIt might not a great example but it\'s kind of how we calculate revenue for tipping amount.\n\nimage.png1670x844 78.5 KB\n\nYellow one is if we do math each record. Blue one is what we do now. (In this sheets, it\'s not using exactly the same as our code but pretty much the same. )(Yellow one could be higher than Blue one; it depends on Tipped coins and sources )\nAlso we collapsed tipping revenue record by date and it\'s going crazy to calculate...  I think we should display more information as much as we can. I\'ll discuss it with team tomorrow and update this thread(Or Michael) if we have some notices.

The best proof I have about the problem is this update: https://tapas.io/episode/74612610While the first two scenes preserve the original colors (if you look at her dress you'll easily ontice), the last ones are less intense and vibrant. This problem is bugging me a bit since in my story the colors are important. Also, I want to point out that there's a month and a formatted pc of difference between the first scenes and the last ones.
Another detail is that I've uploaded all those pages in Deviantart and my Sta.sh and there's no color loss, which makes all of this more weird to me.
I don't know what's the problem with it, I've checked all the files and I see no difference, but still can't figure out what's going on so I'm asking here looking for someone who knows what's the real problem in all of this.

Not sure why that hasn't been fixed but I posted twice for help on it and here we are still.2- In the early hours after an Episode goes up for one of my comics, I can't get a display thumbnail when I share it on social media. Meaning, if I attempt to share the individual episode, I get a generic image for tapas alone without the customary Episode teaser (that would look more professional) so I just end up sharing the entire series again and telling people there's a new episode.Not sure why this keeps going on with my account as I don't have any of these issues on Webtoons.Anyone else experiencing hardships on Tap that are confusing?","[""I can't speak to your first issue because I don't write or publish novels, but I'm not surprised there's a couple bugs with that functionality since the option to publish them JUST launched recently. Hoping someone else will help you with that.\nI've experienced your 2nd issue before. On Facebook, all it usually takes is a reload of my page and trying to post it again. On Twitter, even if the image doesn't show up right away, it WILL show up later. I don't know why there's a lag.\nBecause each issue is different I kinda assumed it was the social media site's fault, not Tapas. I could be wrong though.

I won't even advertise until it' fixed.I think you're right on the second part so I just need to wait awhile before posting an ad on social media for some reason. Maybe it's a browser issue?My tech support for Tap is in the forums as I have no idea how to reach the staff or get official answers on anything.That;s why people say Tap is a platform for readers, not the creators who give them all their content. My comics are growing much faster on Webtoons for some reason (even though I don't like jpg format) even without me advertising. I advertise for Tap because I like the interface and png presentation better for comics. Plus the app is better. That being said, I may not keep my properties here in the long run. I have 8 in production now but only putting 5 on here. Gonna experiment with different options for the others. If I was creating strictly for fun, I like the community here and the presentation (when it's working) but for those of us who hope to turn this into our business, I think there may be better ways.

If you decide to not stick around it\'s totally up to you of course! I like it because I can schedule my episodes and the reading experience. It\'s generally more community oriented here too?

At least on Tapas your comic has a chance of getting on the front page even if you\'re not sponsored by them, and networking is easier.\nAs far as popularity goes, Webtoons is definitely higher traffic. I think that\'s the biggest reason things get subs and attention faster. I like using both but Tapas is my home for the moment.

Try this, it worked for me.
In your Dashboard, click the edit button for the series you want, and then find the episode that is suppose to post in your list. Click the blue Date/Time that's under the episodes title. It'll bring up the calendar for you to schedule it. Click the Publish now button in that calendar.

It can also be horror-romance which focus in relationship between a human and a scary bloodsucking monster like in saya no uta (don't google it).
I think webcomics should be allowed to add more genres, not for the sake of creators but mostly readers, to help us find more webcomics we might get attached to.","['That\'s true. On Tapastic, my comic is labeled just comedy, but it\'s really comedy-adventure. Without the ""adventure"" part, people could just think it\'s simply a comedy. The story is much bigger than just comedy.\nYou can tag your comic, but it\'s not as helpful as a real category. When a reader wants Action-Comedy, they\'d have to choose one or the other and it\'s like 50/50 whether your comic is in one of those options.', ""I would argue that having to choose one genre to tag your comic is a little bit more useful, it makes it so creatoros have to think hard about where their work best fits into, for readers it makes it so they get to see a different set of comics when browsing each category. \nI'm sympathetic though, I had a really difficult time trying to decide what to tag my minicomic with, because it's weird and artsy and doesnt fit into any genre well at all.  I could have put it under Drama, but I went with fantasy because I figure fantasy readers would appreciate it the most. I've run into a similar issue with my other comic that's not released yet, it could go into drama or horror or comedy or romance.

"", ""Some other threads along this theme: (1) (2) (3)2 (4) (5)\nWhenever it's come up, most creators agree that the genre system here is insufficient. It's not just an issue of too-broad categories, either -- there's lots of comics with genres that are straight-up not present. Where does Historical Fiction go?

If you search for ""deaf,"" my comic is the fourth result. I have no idea why! It doesn\'t change if I become more popular, or if I\'ve updated more recently, or anything -- that\'s my spot forever as far as I can tell. If you take a larger search like ""dragon"" or ""lgbt"" it becomes sort of useless -- as a creator, if your comic is #267 in that list, no one will find you unless they go through over 200 comics; and as a reader, my search will be clogged with comics that haven\'t updated in years, and there\'s no way for me to sort them.\nThey\'re invisible. You can\'t look at anyone else\'s comic and tell what it\'s tagged -- you only see what tags are being used by searching for them. Furthermore, there\'s no way for readers to tell what tags we tend to use. Even if we all collectively decided that we\'d use ""longform"" as a tag for longform stories, there\'s no way for readers to know that they can search for ""longform"" to find those kinds of comics, so there\'s no way for us to really make use of the tags as a community. It only works for things that readers  will think to search for.\n\nOn the main page, you can look at all comics in a genre, and then sort them by whatever metric you want -- most recent update, most popular, most subscribers, etc. If you could search for and sort all comics under a certain tag in the same way, I think that would fix half the problem. The other thing I\'d personally really like to see would be to either make tags visible somewhere, or make a ""popular tags"" cloud that readers could see, or something like that, so that if we all just started tagging ""urban fantasy"" or ""supernatural"" or ""historical"" comics, readers would be able to see that it\'s something they can search for, and we could essentially define our own genres as a community.\nBut that\'s just my take on it; simply adding subgenres would go a long way, too.', 'Yeah, the one genre thing really bothers me as well. I put my comic in comedy but I feel like it is actually just as much fantasy as comedy ^^; ', 'I really wish we could choose multiple genres.

If a person wants to find a dark modern story about vampire intrigue in a large city, their options are: Fantasy.

If you search for ""deaf,"" my comic is the fourth result. I have no idea why! It doesn\'t change if I become more popular, or if I\'ve updated more recently, or anything -- that\'s my spot forever as far as I can tell.\nI didn\'t know this, and it is awful, I agree.  There really should be some way to at least sort the tag search results! Otherwise it really is pretty much useless to anyone and everyone. I would really like to see this system extensively revised, because we\'re really not being well served by the tag system at all; we already have to promote our work, and I feel it would be nice if Tapastic helped us at least on their own site. As it is, we kind of have to be lucky to grab those eyes in whatever avenue we choose to promote.\n\n\nshazzbaa:\nThe other thing I\'d personally really like to see would be to either make tags visible somewhere, or make a ""popular tags"" cloud that readers could see, or something like that, so that if we all just started tagging ""urban fantasy"" or ""supernatural"" or ""historical"" comics, readers would be able to see that it\'s something they can search for, and we could essentially define our own genres as a community.\nThis would be so good. I completely concur -- one of the things that has led to things getting notice on other sites is a unity of using the same tags to define things.', '\n\nshazzbaa:\nmake tags visible somewhere, or make a ""popular tags"" cloud that readers could see, or something like that\nYeah, the cloud is a good idea, and the most useful I think, would be to be able to click on one of the visible tags under a comic you like, to try and find similar comics... \nAlso multiple tag search would help narrow down results...\nMaybe if we do this ""reader\'s guide to Tapastic"" we talked about in some other thread, we could tell them about the tagging system... Because if you don\'t have your own comic, there\'s no way you\'d know about it, which doesn\'t help.', 'Being able to pick multiple genres is one of the ""unholy trinity"" of things people ask to fix since forever. The other two sins are the broken tagging system and no blocking system.', 'Mine is a Comedy Action Romance comic. I now and then switch the genra because it bugs me that I can only choose one.', ""From what @shazzbaa said though, the tags system sounds really broken, I would argue that that's something worth complaing about because it makes it harder for people to find comics that they'll enjoy and by extension is makes it harder for creators to find an audience, which is the main reasons for using tapastic instead of other hosts. as for blocks, theyre important to have access to, even in a community as great as Tapastic's. \nI dunno, dismissing a complaint because lots of other people complain about it doesnt sound like a constructive thing to do."", ""I'm actually not too bothered by the single genre choice. When you think about it any work is only a single genre with a minor genre that accompanies it. Plus it would be kind of annoying if I look in different genres and I saw multiples of the same exact series in multiple genre lists (ex. if I search video game, slice of life, and comedy, then I see Gamercat in both)."", ""But I didn't dismiss a complaint...? I think you misunderstood me."", '\n\nKoreanTacos:\nit would be kind of annoying if I look in different genres and I saw multiples of the same exact series in multiple genre lists\nNo, the point would be to only find the comic in the main category. For example, if NDGO puts her comic Jamie under Slice of Life as a main and romance as a subgenre, you could only find her comic when choosing Slice of Life first (and more easily if you filter that category by choosing ""romance"" as the sub). But you wouldn\'t find it if you\'re browsing the romance category. The point is to make it easier for the readers to find something they like (and thus improving visibility for our comics).', 'They might have been talking about the staff (:', 'Hmmm? Oooh! My bad XD', 'nah I was talking to @jutawi.  Sure the Staff should do something but they\'ve got their hands full, im sure they\'ll get to it eventually.

It's been a rough few days as we're all weathering the storm of maintenance, updates, and ongoing bugs.As a believer in Tapas, I just wanted to send good vibes to the Tapas team and hopes that they knock out the bugs and come back BETTER than before!
What are your thoughts? Frustrations?  Experiences?Any obscure bugs you wanna share to check and see if others are experiencing it, too?
(Note:  This is a forum thread for sharing of information.  If you have actual issues or if you want to give official feedback, I recommend using the website and/or app's Feedback module)
Also, some fan art of Deslim3 from my series7 as she taps away on Tapas =):
 
My series: The Middle Crowd7
CHANGES AND KNOWN ISSUES: (Live Update)
MUST have an iPhone compatible with iOS 8 or higher-Older iPhones that can't update to iOS 8 or 9 won't be able to use the Tapas app.  That means that you'll need an iPhone 4s or newer.
Daily Snack has been removed-Tapas stated (from in-app feedback) that they have removed it and are planning on ""figuring out other ways to send notifications with awesome stories to check out""
Image compression has changed for newly uploaded images-Images are receiving heavier compression (or lossy) than before when uploading a new episode (confirmed by seeing before/after image file size)EDIT: Quality change of compression is subjective.  If you have notable issues, contact below.

isyoon:
Can you send me an original image to isyoon@tapasmedia.co?  if there is an issue I'll enhance the compressor.
The ""Add Translation Button"" has been removed and previous episode translations could not be preserved during the server migration-If you had preexisting episodes that had multiple translations, they have been removed after maintenance.  Proposed solution below:


michaelson:
We encourage creators to create a separate series and tag them accordingly. We will be assembling various collections that gather certain language comics together to make them easier to find.
-----------------FIXED:-------------------
Issues scheduling future episode releases.-There's a confirmed issue if you try to schedule a release at a later date.  (Confirmed via twitter @tapas_app)  They are aware and working on it.
Posting a picture on your wall disappears if post is edited-If you post a picture post on your wall, but edit the post afterwards, the picture will disappear.  Only way for people to see it is to create a new post.  (Example of it happening: https://tapastic.com/viryse/posts/22925101?fan_comment_id=4676717)
No Search in App They added it ^_^
Forum Login Issues has been resolved
Custom Ad  Banner does not appear-The Custom Ad Banner that you can upload and link does not appear properly.  (It's the extra image you can place on the lower right corner of each episode, just below the view/like/comment counter.
PNGs now appear in the Tapas App (you MUST update the app in order to see it

Tapas Mobile App - Your thoughts on it?
Folks - thanks for tuning in to the livestream. Just wanted to share some stuff I mentioned in the livestream, which may not cover all possible questions but just to share some answers in random order:    App issues: search is not there yet, png...






TL:DRThere's issues, most are known and currently being worked on, @tapas_app on twitter is the MOST UP-TO-DATE source of info from Tapas, and everyone should hang tight!","[""All-in-all, I think the new app is nice. I WOULD like to see it eventually become a fully featured tool for creators as well as readers (ability to see notifications, check stats, upload and edit comics, etc), and it does desperately need a search function, but that's been addressed 100 times. But the layout and design of the app is a nice starting point.\nNow that uploading is up, I have noticed some inconsistencies with the quality of comics being uploaded, it looks like sometimes they get compressed quite a bit. Notifications seem to be hit and miss (that is, I'm not getting notifications for likes and comments 100% ot the time I think). \nOne thing in particular to the app, if I tap to see the number of likes and comments on a comic, then swipe to the next comic, the number of likes and comments still display the previously viewed comic. But yeah, most of the bugs seem to be down to those minor things now that the core functionality seems to be working fine now."", ""\n\nlyon:\nI WOULD like to see it eventually become a fully featured tool for creators as well as readers (ability to see notifications, check stats, upload and edit comics, etc)\nTHIS! This is my only issue with the app at the moment.\nI really like the look of the new app and I've enjoyed it now that the comics I've subscribed to pop up at the top of the bookmarked tab again."", ""I'm just glad that the Tapacalypse is over.It's been quite frustrating and confusing. From the things I encountered was being unable to post anything, site crashing every few minutes, and the forum being reduced to white blank screen. Funny thing was when I wanted to check the stats screen, it kicked me out to the Tapastic front page.And from the things I just heard about - months of peoples queues were unlocked all at once, and some people were unable to write more than one line of text in their comments."", ""For the long list of issues I have with the app, reading comics on it is honestly the thing I think of that annoys me first. I don't know if it's universal or just my phone but reading comics on the new app is a pain in the ass compared to what it was before.\nBefore it was just 'keep scrolling up', \nnow it's'click to get past pop up info, scroll up, swipe right, click to get past pop up info, scroll up, swipe right. con.' \nor of you're a comment reader it's'click to get past pop up info, scroll up, click yo open up pop up info again, click on comments to read, click on each individual comment to see the responses, back, back, swipe right' repeat for the next page / episode."", ""I have to agree with @kurapikasuki I hardly open the app anymore because of this to be honest. Also, the app is very beautiful and well designed, I really love the categories section, but the app doesn't really suit me... I like discovering and reading new comics and I used to be able to browse and find new comics much easier in the older app, there was a trending section and the popular sections like in the website, which are missing from the new app...Also the daily snack..I really miss the daily snack orz\nBut other than that the app has been working fine for me, although some of my readers complained that the episode was not loading properly yesterday."", 'So far I like the app well enough, but I\'m not 100% pleased with it. I hope there will be updates in the future that will make me like it more (and I get the feeling that this will be the case). It\'s been said, but I miss having a search function. I also don\'t think it\'s intuitive how to use the app yet, but I\'m sure with time it will become second nature ^.^ I think it looks beautiful, so that\'s definitely a plus. \nI also realized that I may be addicted to the forums and tapastic in general XD I\'ve been lost the past couple of days, endlessly refreshing and wondering whether it was me or the forums that were buggy.

I missed the forums >.< glad they\'re back!', ""Hey, I've actually got a question (sorry if this has been answered elsewhere but)I read a thread a while ago about the creator support program being removed from the site and I recently noticed that the premium comics category has also dissipated, but then I got like 600 free coins for purchasing premium comics with, when I downloaded the new app, Does that mean this stuff is coming back?"", ""my phone is too old to install iOS 8 so i can't use Tapas B)"", 'same @zetina same B)', ""I'm glad Taps is back, though I didn't mind waiting.

I've noticed this too. It's like there's a higher compression setting going on when uploading files. A 500 kb jpg image gets compressed to 250 kb when uploaded to an episode. The comic looks great on the all, but a bit hazy on the site. Guess, perhaps I'll have to upload a higher image quality to somehow counteract the compression? :shrug:\nInkLion:I read a thread a while ago about the creator support program being removed from the site and I recently noticed that the premium comics category has also dissipated, but then I got like 600 free coins for purchasing premium comics with, when I downloaded the new app, Does that mean this stuff is coming back?\nIn a way, kind of, Premium comics is sort of coming back. Basically, from what I understand, the coins can be used to unlock chapters of books and comics that have been enrolled in that. These books and comics need to be curated and approved by the staff first, at least in the beginning until it can be rolled out to everyone(?). So this in-app purchasing coin system is what's replacing the support program/premium. Since real money is used to buy coins, a percentage of the value in the coin goes to the artist that coin is spent on. It'll be interesting to see this start to take off."", ""It is definitely harder to actually read the comics on this version of the app. You have to swipe and then nudge the page back up a little if you have comments then it kind of blows the swipe mechanism if you're trying to go to the next page. Minor tweaks I'm sure."", ""I mean it's still hard to say since Tapas is still being updated and i don't know what features they have in store, but here's what I think as of now. I think the interface is pretty, but not gonna lie I liked the old app better. I think my biggest problem is that the system is not very helpful to new people (unless of course they get noticed by the staff) Even on the old tapastic newcomers with low sub numbers pretty much just had the fresh page and not much else. Now to even get to the fresh page, you have to click through 5 things to find it. Also wish that mobile subscribers would get notified of wall posts, but maybe that feature will be added later on. Also, not something i don't like, but I'm a little worried about how well the new key system is going to work. In an environment where there is a lot of free things mixed with some things for pay, I'm not sure how well the content behind the paywall will fare, but who knows, maybe it well work out well for creators, i at least hope so!"", ""Personally im indifferent to it. I kinda like it and i kinda don't. It reminds me a bit of a kindle app. The layput is nice. Its smooth i WILL miss the daily snack. because i wanted to be on there one day plus i liked the little message everyday. Im not sure how the coins work unless its just for select people...which i kinda eh....i saw one comic that had the coins and im sure there are others but i was lost as to how they got to use that feature so quickly unless they had some sort of agreement with the staff. But since its still updating who knows just yet!"", ""So, I've been following the transition to the new app issues through Tapastic's twitter account.  From what I've read there, experienced myself, and read in this thread so far, I've consolidated all the issues on the first post.  If there's any more definite issues to add OR if an issue has successfully been resolved, PLEASE post and let us know!\nSide note: I feel like I'm starting to sound like I work for Tapas, which I don't.  For me, I can see a lot of frustrations expressed throughout the site comments/page posts/tapas Facebook page comments.  I figured the more everyone's up-to-date on issues and their resolution, the better =P.  I came across a depressing amount of comments of confused people who were done with tapastic in general.

1002,Best method for integrating Animation or gifs into comic page,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hi guys! I have a few projects in the works that I will be adding animation into. I searched the forum as to 'how' this is  done, but usually it's people's opinions on the matter and not the technical process. I am an animator, and I am familiar with PS, After effects, Paint tool sai, Flash, and many other programs, but when it comes to making a gif within my comic page I freeze up. I know PS only allows a handful of potential movements and doesn't have path animation. For anyone who has .gifs in your comic, could I have your insight on an overview of how you do it (do you ink in PS then take it to flash or AE?). This would help me out so much, I've been running all over the forums and can't get the answer I need ;_;
 Thank youuuuu","[""If you're doing only a few animated panels on a page, I'd recommend singling out the panels you want to be animated and exporting just those panels as gifs. \nYou can use any animation program you'd like this way, even Toonboom (I recommend that one). That's how I did mine on this episode161 (animation is about halfway down the page)\nOr if you're wanting to keep the whole page together in one gif file, I recommend keeping the animations short and simple. Mikaela B.'s series Brain Damage112 does this really well.\nIf you're planning to make the whole page animated, like Bog Girl82, then that'll be a lot more complicated work. But I'd recommend dividing the page into rows, maybe 2 or 3 panels tops per row, and tackling the page one row at a time. Then when done, export each row as it's own gif and upload them inorder to tapastic."", ""Well I use photoshop to create my character, doing layer for my animated part like leg, arm, then I import it in  to after effect to do all the animations, and effect. I export it in video at this time it is a 25 image per sec animation so I import to premiere and edit it too match the size of 2 mo or less, so most of the time it is 2 image per sec, but can vary. And I also add text and small effect. I know it is kinda over complecated way of doing it, but I find that animation in after effect to be way easyer than photoshop, but for simple animation photoshop is suffisent. All depend on the image you want to produce, so you really need to think of what you want to show.Also as cyndifoster said, if you. Plan on doing a lot of animation on your page, do row by row, because other wise the image will be lager than  2 mo and also it will be easer to animate as loop of animation will be independent.Hope this help, if you have any specific question I will be happy to answer, if I can ^^.My animated comic if you want to check it out : the pirates' paradise36\nAlso if anyone has animated comics, I would love to see it  likeBog Girl  "", ""I too am familiar with those programs...(i think).I've found the best proccess for this is flash, as it has a time line. the real problem is whats going on in each panel and page, now make as many keyframes  you need for the longest animation, this is the length of your gif. as gif loops you need one consistant panel animation to work from.then animation each panel type on one time line( you can use graphics but keep in mind how long it is)then lets say you're done and have 3 animated panels to make up your page and the 1st panel is 5 frames of animatio and the 2nd is 6 and the 3rd is 7, okay so the 3rd is your longest now add more key frames of the 1st frame to each of the other panels so they are present entirely. Now I find it useful to go to export - as jpeg seqeunce. this gives more detail than gif export inside flash. Then import it into photoshop, go file - scripts - load files to stack. wait till they are loaded. then click the button on the top right of your timeline and go make frames from layers, then go to button again and click reverse frames. play it make sure it works. then go save for web and change it to gif and resize to 940 and click export. now keep in mind you might have a different version. This could all be done in photoshop as well but thats really complicated for large animation. let me know if you would like help on that. hope that helps "", ""Here's a detailed progress on how I did my gifs for the comic Skies aren't blue59\n\nfirst of all, I don't animate a whole page, I only decide which panel should be animated. That panel will be uploaded separately from the rest of the page, but it will have the correct dimensions so that it doesn't stand out, and give an illusion of being a solid part of the whole page.\nI open Paint Tool Sai, where I create separate frames for my gif. It's a bit tricky as I don't have a comfortable timeline like in Flash, nor any built in effects, so my animation is very basic. The process of drawing each panel is pretty much same as in Flash, except  I have to depend on my instincts if the movement is done smoothly.\nI throw all the panels into PhotoScape program, which has an option to make gifs. Here I can see how the animation is going, I can time it to my hearts content, depending on trial and error to get my desired effect. The reason why I use PhotoScape and not Flash is that PhotoScape doesn't decrease the quality of my gifs. (I'm using a very old Flash and it's very limited :'D )\nif the animation seems choppy or wrong, I go back to Sai and correct it, whether adding more panels or adjusting the animation slightly\nafter I finally manage to get the timing right, I export the gif and it's ready to post online.\n""]",1/21/2017 23:24,,,,,,,,,

Since 2013 I've been using a wacom pen&touch small for doing my digital art. Even though I tried many art software my favorite has always been Paint Tool Sai. However, the sensitivity and the stabilizers wouldn't work sometimes but still, it was easy to fix by re-installing the drivers.

1029,Tapas App Readers Wish List For Future Versions,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Tapastic is an amazing group of artists, authors, and readers. As a reader, my experience is completely different on the website and on the mobile app. I personally prefer the app because I always have my phone with me, and when I'm in front of a big screen, I'm probably working. I'm starting this thread hoping to create a space where readers can express what they want to see in future versions of the app, and hopefully get short answers* from the developers about whether their wishes will or will not, might or might not be part of our future Tapastic app experience. *Answers like: Impossible, Next Update, Tried and failed to implement, I'll see if there's a way to do that, Would take a team of a thousand, Only possible in iOS, Only possible in Android, Against our policy, Artists would never go for it, Could be abused by spammers, etc.
Here is my list of wishes: - Many people complain that we can't tap a URL in a comment to jump to another comic or a Web page. I think that's a good thing, because it might allow spammers to fill comments with links to their spam. The easiest way would be to allow us to tap on links in artist's comments, but not links in reader's comments. - If that's not possible, perhaps you could make a way for artists to add a link button that only they could program. This would allow buttons that jump to other places within Tapastic to be one color and buttons that have to launch an external Web browser to be a different color.      - Give artists the ability to add a link button in their comments section so they can point to the comics of guest artists, collaborators, a previous comic episode for reference, or just another Tapastic comic they like.      - Give artists the ability to add a link button in their comments section of a different color that allows them to point to an outside Web page, like a Patreon page, the artist's own website, a recommended DeviantArt artist, etc. (I don't think it would be a good idea to make it possible to click any link because that would invite spammers to post links, but if the artists controlled what the link buttons did, they would have more control.)

You have indicators on comic thumbnails of a that show a white clock for waiting for a free key, a green key for unused keys, and a red ""New"" circle for new episodes since the last time I opened one of the episodes. I propose these additional indicators, possibly as a hollow circle around where the red New circle goes. That way the New circle would be surrounded by a colored circle. I'm suggesting primary colors, so if 2 conditions are true, the circle can be the secondary color between them. If all are true, the circle can be black or white.
A yellow circle on comic thumbnails if I have unread episodes that I have unlocked, that is, the episode with the turned down corner in the list of episodes is not the last unlocked episode.
A blue circle on comic thumbnails if I still have unread episodes that are still locked.
A red circle on comic thumbnails if I've read all the episodes, so I can consider it complete until the next update.
(If I see no circle at all, then I'll know I haven't looked at that one yet.)


You have over ten thousand different comics. I'd like a way to mark a comic as ""Don't show this anymore"" if I've read every episode and the last one was posted long ago, or if I have read some of it and never want to see it again, or any other reason. Once marked, they will be put in a category like ""Zzzzzz"" and won't show up again in lists of ""recommended"" or ""new"" or ""popular"" or any other category or place I might go looking for comics I might want to read and subscribe to. Then I can look at comics I might really like, instead of wasting time opening forgettable ones I decided months or years ago that I did not want to read. The ""Zzzzzz"" category could still be available at the very bottom of lists so I could uncheck it, or look at it again if someone suggests a second look from a different point of view.

1068,Dashboard Trouble,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Is anyone else having...issues (if you can call it that) with the Dashboard statistics? My stats have been relatively wonky at times and while not necessarily hindering at the moment it is confusing at times. For example the ""Subs"" int he ""All"" section are correct. However the sub number in the selective series are about one off. It's almost like either the dashboard hasn't recognized the number difference or someone is missing on the list. 
I went to my series, and personally messed around with them, subbing and unsubbing and as I do so, the number of course changes to the right one. Yet the moment I reset or go somewhere else, the statistic number goes back to what it was before. It's just kind of gets stuck. Now this by itself wouldn't necessarily be a problem, as long as I'm getting readership and view counts, what the sub number directly says is something I can get over.
But there are times even then where questionable things seem to happen. There have been times when I've checked the activity feed and found out I got something 2-3 hours ago but never got that red notification for it. I've seemingly received subs for a series that last time I checked, they had already subbed to before, because I always like to give a quick thanks to those supporters. Who knows, maybe they got rid of their sub and wanted to sub back.
Even my view count has taken a shocking nose dive out of the blue. As usual I might just interpret it as that time of the year, school, university though I'd at least expect it to be more...discreet. but with the clearly issues of the dashboard statistics and what not, I have to ask if anyone else is having similar trouble.

Dear Tapastic. 
I see this a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Like, too much a lot. I write very, very long responses. And then I get this, a lot! What is the error? Is it something random and different every time? Is Tapastic really that buggy? Or how about when I reload the page, paste and send again? Oh, it comes up again. Is that the same error too? Or is that a different error? Every time? Oh, it's probably your fault? Probably? Oh, so you're saying you don't know? It's just a magical error that appeared out of nowhere, and there's just no way you can know what it is, or who's fault it was? 
Right, right, you get my point. I'm salty, and this is aggravating, and I'm done with putting up with it. You know what the first step to solving a problem is? Admitting there is one. Oh, but that admission part also needs to recognize what the problem is, other wise admission to a mysterious problem is pointless. So instead of telling me ""something unexpected"" happened, why don't you tell me what that unexpected thing was. 
Because if it's not your fault and it's mine, I can probably fix it. If it is your fault and you tell me what it is, I can tell you to fix it. This problem is recurring, and every time it happens I copy, reload and paste, and get the same result. I'm not rewriting every message I send, tapastic. 
And the kicker is, when I do rewrite them, some times I can send things again! Not all the time, but sometimes. So it seems like there are certain things I can and cannot write? And send? Hmm? Is that right? Are you telling me that there are designated things that can and/or cannot be written and sent, and you're not gonna tell me what those things are? 
TELL ME. WHAT'S WRONG. SO I. CAN. FIX. IT.
I'm not playing a guessing game to figure out what I can and cannot write/send. Please excuse my saltiness. The message, by nature, is aggravating. Maybe you should consider changing the mysterious nature of this message box. 
Also, I'm posting this as a public thread because maybe others have trouble with this message and are equally upset about how often it pops up. Maybe it's just me though. Which, now that I think about it, would be especially fucked up.","['Like, when I know what\'s wrong, I can either take action or know that I can\'t take action.

I\'ve already tried breaking it up and it hasn\'t worked. Besides, I know for a fact that I have written longer responses and still sent them with no problems. \nWhen I said ""Very, very long responses"", I was giving an idea as to why it\'d be a pain in the ass to rewrite my responses every time I send them. They are not so ridiculously long that they actually hit a character limit, although it\'s possible that a limit on the number of responses in a single chain of PM\'s exists. However I must note I have also had PM chains that were longer than the PM chain I am having trouble with now. So in this particular case, we can rule this out. \nIn this particular scenario I have lost the copy of the original response I wrote, so I have to rewrite it now anyways. That doesn\'t change this problem though. Even if the problem was any of the possibilities presented, the fact still remains that without knowledge of exactly which errors and to what extent they are, one cannot begin to solve the problem when presented this problem. Trust me, I have tried many a thing to get past these error messages. Every time I surpass it it would seem to be by chance or luck. Which is simply unacceptable. (In this paragraph I am referencing past experiences with this error message as well as the current problem. This is a common occurrence for me, and I promise you it isn\'t character limits)\nBy the way, Tapastic staff, this post is very specifically for you. Unless you have laid out a secret set of rules out to particular users on the site, only you can know what\'s going on and only you can fix the shortcoming that is this error message.

The lack of a search bar was unpopular  and their rating went from a 4.4 to 4.1 in the android play store.\nThis theory might explain your drop in viewership.\nTheory 2) viewership style has shifted since the update. Two things are different: first is that the trending category is no longer on the app. This probably doesn't hurt you a lot but when you update and people come flooding in it does occasionly place you there; second is the category algorithms have changed compared to to the category algorithms on the website. Popular is no longer momentarily popular but now all time popular and fresh is no longer momentarily fresh but now all time fresh. \nThis will only affect subs and the shift just depends on who you are competing with. For some people it could be good because they could have a more stable position near the top and for smaller comics it could be more difficult to grow.\nHow is your position in your particular mobile category?\n*EDIT: I later realized that since there are no longer only three categories there could now be a drop in views for popular comics. The idea is this: before, your updates could have pushed you above all comics whereas now the viewer has to go search for your comic in a specific categories. So maybe the new categories benefit popular comics compared to other comics in that category, but they could be lowering the possible rewarded viewership for everyone.* \n-GLAD"", 'I like the 4 thousand dead subscribers theory.', ""@thomassayle XD!! So I'm not the only one with that problem? (mine began WAY before the update...)"", ""Same here. What's worse for me is that views dropped just as the action was starting. I think that the stories that already have a considerable following got back on track a little easier.

A few weeks ago I started experiencing my program glitching out almost and the tablet pressure stopped working. I managed to solve this however and it worked for a few weeks. But now all my color has disappeared! 
I can draw but only in the color white. I tried unplugging my tablet and draw with a mouse connected to my computer but that didn't work either. When I change the background to red or any other color I can see the strokes I've made with my brush but they stay white, nothing else.

I guess I could work with that and export my files as images or just make copies of the original files but again, that's a lot of extra work to do every time I want to draw something new. I could accidentally delete some of my works or similar things.

1149,Page performance slows after viewing several episodes in a row,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Not sure if anyone else has noticed this but:
When I binge through a series' episodes and I scroll through >10 episodes, I start to notice the page slow down. Images load a bit slower, the scrolling is lagging a bit, etc.
I'm not an expert at web development and I'm not sure how the site is set up, but it could be that some ads are heavier than others and end up piling up over time in terms of javascript load. Not to mention, the variety of console errors is probably from the ads as well. This is probably in part to the dynamic loading of episodes by scrolling, but if there was a way to clear past ads that might help things stay fast even while binging a series. @isyoon 
I know just hard refreshing a page would solve this, so it's just a small nitpick. I'm not sure if there's already prior screening to not show any of the really bad ads (I'm looking at you, video ads), but it'd be nice if people weren't annoyed after they turned off their adblocker to support the site.
Thanks!

","['It\'s a heavy page loading script running to remove the need for ""next"" buttons is what is causing this. It could be optimised, but it seems other websights with infinite scrolling are also suffering from this performance issue, like tumblr.

I can take a ""next"" button to advance if this means better performance.', ""now that you mention it, I do recall the page crashing on tumblr after a really long scroll session. But I remember it being a sudden crash and not really seeing any signs of heavy load beforehand.\nThere's like 1-2mb of new javascript with each episode load, which is a lot considering a lot of websites are entirely under 1mb. I think most of these are coming from ads, whereas other scrolly websites are just loading images most of the time.\nI turned on adblocker for a bit on Tapastic just to see if it would make a difference, and it was 100% better.

1158,Possible share-stat issues,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I'm aware that there are problems with the logging of views and that these are due to the database issues, but there is another thing that has been bothering me lately. 
My readers have been fairly good at sharing my pages with the rest of the world, but lately, my share-stats have dropped off dramatically. And I don't mean a gradual fall - I mean overnight: 
Share-stats.PNG915x530 44.4 KB
 Between September 28th and October 2nd, it drops sharply from the teens and twenties down to - one. And the highest shares per page I've gotten since October 2nd have been 5. 
Now, it's possible that my readers have collectively decided not to share my pages any more - but it doesn't seem likely. The drop is so big and so sudden, and I've gotten no other indications that people are unwilling to share my pages. The number of views per page doesn't decline, and the number of likes and comments are staying on the same level - it's just the shares that suddenly drop like a stone.

But since we've phased this aspect out, we've decided to track shares different. Originally, we would track direct shares and indirect shares. This means, when a reader would share your comic on Facebook, and someone on Facebook shares THAT post, we would track both. But Facebook has changed how information is sent to us - meaning we can't track the indirect shares anymore. I don't know why.\nThis sort of explains why the numbers were inflated prior to the change. \nAlso, you have to look at the correlation between share count and page views - you can see that despite the drop in share count, the views have remained relatively the same. Basically, nothing has really changed - only the cosmetic aspect of how we count shares - I would also like to point out that this is kind of outside of our control as we rely on Facebook to provide us with that data and the nature of how they count those shares has changed. \nHope that sheds some light on the changes. \nBUT!

1201,Webcomic Images Not Loading/Slow,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hello Tapastic,
Most of the time, when I would browse through some of the archives of the webcomics here, images would often take almost or more than a minute to load up or perhaps they won't load at all unless you refresh. I've been ignoring this issue but it's been a consistent one for about a month now and I feel the need to bring this to attention. Is anybody having trouble with the comic's images loading too?
If it is a universal problem, I feel like this makes a negative impact on the artists of their respective comics as well, especially the ones that have 100+ episodes. This is because one person could get fed up waiting for these images to load that they end up cutting the comic short, which potentially can cost them a subscriber. I'm one of those people who needs to get familiar with the comic before I subscribe to it.
Please advise if this is on my end or on everyone's end and if it's being looked into.
Many thanks.","[""There are sooo many comics that I've been meaning to read but haven't because every time I've sat down to do it, I'm met with the 2+ minute page loads or they just flat out don't load at all (even with refreshing). From what I've sort of noticed, it seems even worse on weekends (Which is of course the only time I actually have time to read lol). This seems sorta strange though considering traffic on Tapastic seems to be way slower on weekends. Maybe that part is just me? However, I can definitely say you aren't the only one. I've had plenty of conversations with others about how slow Tapastic is and that it's definitely a problem that we all hope is getting fixed."", ""Yeah, I've had this problem too. Not sure what's going on."", ""Yeah, I've pretty much stopped reading comics with large archives on here unless they have a standalone website. It's a massive deal breaker, and I'm concerned it'll stop people from catching up with my own comic too, of course D: Really hope this gets sorted."", ""Yeah, they are loading super-slowly during high-traffic hours - it's usually fine when I get up in the morning, at around 07.30 local Swedish time - but it slows down considerably in the evenings, which is when the majority of American users are awake and using the site. \nI'm hoping it gets sorted soon, because it's annoying to say the least."", ""\n\nDingbat1991:\nI feel like this makes a negative impact on the artists of their respective comics as well, especially the ones that have 100+ episodes. This is because one person could get fed up waiting for these images to load that they end up cutting the comic short, which potentially can cost them a subscriber\nI am that one person. I went comic hunting and had to stop because every time I wanted to see the next page, I'd have to reload it and/or wait a few minutes. I've been cleaning my PC and browser, thinking it must be on my end, but it clearly isn't.  This is the first time I've come into this problem, around the same time I'm usually on this site, so I'm not sure what it is. In the past, sometimes I'd have to reload a page or wait an extra second, but those instances were far and few and definitely not frustratingly annoying. It would really suck if the only solution is to wait until nobody is on this site to read comics without a problem. 9"", ""I posted about this a month ago. I can set the clock on when Tapastic slows down to a crawl. I'm in Europe, and it starts at 5pm and lasts all through the night until 8am.

It's natural for any site with a fair amount of traffic each day to have their servers slow down at some point. That said, I just experienced this issue myself so I know how everyone here feels."", ""I've had the same issue since I started using this site and it's probably the main reason it's not my favorite, or my primary host. I also make a point of reading comics on other sites if I find them there, and I'll admit to giving up on comics because trudging through loads was a nightmare.\nMaybe the slowness has something to do with all the coding? I know a lot of the effects on this site make it look modern and smooth but if they make load times so miserable people can't properly read through comics that's kind of a massive problem."", 'I can only guess it really does have to do with traffic.  I\'m in the US so its almost normally slow for me.  It\'s the same on the app too which sucks.  Granted since the app loads on a ""page"" by ""page"" basis its not as bad though I can only imagine what long form comics are like.  \nI think all we can do is wait for them to update their servers to handle all the people using it.']",2/13/2016 19:12,,,,,,,,,

I thought I would be able to use the little popularity I have to make some sort of profit out of my work.\nPremium is not a guaranteed route to money. Considering your current subscriber count and process through your comic, I\'d suggest putting all your focus into your work for now, and worrying about money later. This is not a business to make money in (is that a bit ironic?), at least not right off the bat. If you want to try out some of what Tapastic has to offer in terms of making money, I\'d suggest turning on the Ad Revenue program. It\'s not going to make you rich, but neither is the Premium program, especially at the stats you\'ve got going now (which you can gradually build over time). You can also try out Patreon2 where people can support you and you can reward them with milestone rewards depending on how much they pledge  \nHope that helps!']",2/13/2016 15:36,,,,,,,,,

Something dawned on me today and I think it needs a serious look at. A year ago a statement was release that comics were the comic section only and announcements were for your wall posts only. 
In light of almost ALL of the readers being mobile based or using the app, they can't SEE the creator posts on either, well at least not very well! They're buried under my likes and comments etc, added on top that subscribers don't even see notifications on the mobile/app and if they turned off the email notification .. then the creator are talking to a wall.

When it does become a problem, and you need to start enforcing it more strictly, you don't want people to feel like you pulled the rug from under their feet.

1233,Changing html code,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"I'm making a webcomic for my final assignment for school. A few panels are supposed to be animated, so I was planning on uploading a few GIF's. The problem is, I don't just want normal GIF’s. I want GIF’s that activate the moment your mouse hovers above them. So that the animation has more impact.I searched for a way to make a GIF start like that on Photoshop and on a few online sites. None of them are able to let my GIF ""function"" the way I want it to. I  found on a few sites that by changing the html code, you are able to let the picture move when your mouse hovers above it.
So my question, are you able to change the html code of your GIF on Tapastic, or is that a violation of the rules?
On this site I found and explanation how to change your GIF. I don't really understandit, but this was the most understandable explanation I found. :')

gifplayer
===========
[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/jquery.gifplayer.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/jquery.gifplayer)

Customizable jquery plugin to play and stop animated gifs. Similar to 9gag's.
New: Video support (webm, mp4)

###Basic Usage

1. Add a preview of the gif or video file to your website
2. Specify a ‘data-src’ attribute with the path to the animated gif or video, or simply have an image with the same name and the .gif extension in the same folder of the ‘preview’ image
3. Include jquery.js, jquery.gifplayer.js and gifplayer.css on your site
4. Call the .gifplayer() method for the desired images

```html
<img class=""gifplayer"" src=""media/banana.png"" />
 
<script>
	$('.gifplayer').gifplayer();
</script>

And if changing the html code of your GIF is against the rules, is there another wayto “activate” your GIF, or at least something that triggers it to play?","[""You cannot change HTML functions on Tapastic. What you're describing sounds more like a function job for JavaScript or jquery or something. If you do figure it out, you can do it on your own website, but Tapastic aims to be consistent and easy to use for every user, so HTML/CSS edits aren't doable (maybe some day, but I'm hoping not because that's how you get bugs and errors across comics and websites like SmackJeeves that aren't really that visually appealing IMO.)"", ""I don't really know much about javascript, nor jquery. Either way, thank you for the answer. I don't have an own site, so that's not really an option.But considering html code, javascript and jquery (???) aren't optional anymore, doyou know about any other way to “activate” your GIF, or at least something that triggers it to play? Or is changing html code, or those other two things, unavoidable with the effect I want? \nAgain, thank you for the answer! ^_^"", ""Sorry dude, but it's either auto gifs or no gifs. That doesn't mean you can't still pull off your ideas though. Check out comics like Bog Girl, which are made heavily with gifs."", ""I've already seen that one, and a few other's which use gif's.

I guess I'll just make a new ep for every GIF panel. ^_^"", ""Hm, that does make for an interesting reading experience.\nThe same thing can't be pulled off here on Tapastic. Creators can't program interactions like that based on how far down the reader has scrolled. We can uploaded animated gifs (more that one gif file can be uploaded per episode as long as it's no bigger than 940 px wide and under 2 mb) and we can assign a soundcloud song to an episode. That's about the extent of it.\nBog Girl is the first series that comes to mind for gifs in an episode.http://tapastic.com/series/BogGirl1"", ""I've decided on posting every animated panel in a new episode.

1249,Tapastic Comic Pages Refusing to Load,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hi! I was wondering if anyone could help me out here. I've recently (within the last week or so) had consistent problems on this site getting pages to load. At first I thought it might be a fault in my computer, or specific browser, but I have the same problem on literally every device I've tried to access pages from recently, including a friends very nice up to date computer. I'm not sure if this is a widespread problem, or some issue with settings, or what, but if anyone has any tips on maybe fixing this it would be awesome. I'd like to read some of the comics on here without having to fight tooth and nail to get half a page to load.  : (
(More specifics about the exact loading issue. Typically when I open a comic episode the screen will lag out for a moment, slowly load a small portion of the image files, and then break entirely, giving me the broken image file icon thing. Reloading the page just does the same thing. I've tried to see if maybe I was just looking at comics with huge file sizes or something, but even my own comic does that, and the images on here are actually smaller than those on the original hosting site, which loads fine.)","['Having the same problem right now and I thought it was our internet.

1303,What are the specifics for “mobile-friendly” comics?,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"First of all- apologies if this is the wrong category, but it's tech related, I want support- I figure it might be right.
From staff and regular members alike, there's a lot of discussion about the importance of making comics that look good on mobile. However, this is rather broad and I'm wondering what exactly ""looking good on mobile"" constitutes? Especially considering one of the factors in being featured on this website is looking good on mobile, I feel it's rather important to get better specifics on the topic.
First of all, mobile can be either a tablet or cellphone, and that itself is a variable. The screen size of my small Sony Xperia is far smaller than an apple tablet, and the display and readability will be different. Does the ""looking good"" factor encompass all screen sizes or is there some standard where if it looks good on ""x"" screens and larger that it's good to go?Additionally, say a comic is perfectly readable and looks good when viewed on landscape format on a phone, but doesn't quite look so great on vertical view, would that keep it from being considered not ""mobile-friendly""?
If anyone else has any enquiries as well as to what ""looking good on mobile"" constitutes, feel free to contribute enquiries as well; I'm sure I didn't consider everything! I believe considering mobile formatting for comics is important so I'm curious for what my parameters are to work in.","[""Well, I'd say there's a difference between being readable and optimised for mobile.\nBut I'd say that verticality is the key component. Also, trying not to have more than 2 panels sitting horizontally? Obviously there'd be wiggle room, but in general I'd say that's probably right. I'm no expert, but I'd say the staff are also looking for creative solutions to the mobile format, meaning things like long, vertical panels that tell the story as you scroll. That sort of thing.\nBut rather than issue specific rules, I think you can just ask yourself this one question. Am I getting the full impact without having to pinch and zoom? If the answer is yes, congrats, your comic looks good on mobile."", ""But what if on my very small phone I have to pinch and zoom vertically where as someone with a larger galaxy phone or what not doesn't face those issues?\nI know the things that you told me already, but it's important to establish the standard of what exactly the technical specifics are, not the artistic specifics."", ""Viewing a tall comic (whether it's a vertical scroll comic, or a traditional page style) in a landscape format is not ideal at all IMO. It should be readable without any zooming in on a retina screen phone, portrait mode. I think the biggest thing -- no pun intended -- is making sure that your font is legible when viewed in a small size like that."", ""According to Taptastic's bylines the maximum biggest a submission strip should be is 940px by 4000px with a file size of 2MB. Calculating from there I usually kept my comic's size width under 900px.\nFont size lowest readability is size 12 font though 16 font is usually the ideal size for websites in general.\nPNG is good at preserving detail but becomes a monster file size when gradients and subtle values are added to the mix. It can take a while to load.\nJpeg pixilates especially when file is shrunk. That is a pain in the neck. Good thing about jpeg is it handles gradients well and usually loads faster.\nAlso test your website out as a visitor on several devices as possible. I do this with my computer, my kindle, and my cell phone. This is a good way to make adjustments or you could change the screen size on your computer to see if your website looks good in that screen resolution.\nLastly is the mobile friendly test. I found a website that does that for free. Just put the url through there and wait for analysis.https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/40\nLastly the mobile friendly thing is not set in concrete. Technology changes so much that by the time I've been done typing someone else may have already improved their website. Just keep it simple, keep it clean, and the more organized your website than the happier will be your willing web surfers.So what are your ideas of making a comic more mobile friendly?""]",3/12/2015 21:49,,,,,,,,,

When saving and image to Tapastic\'s, instead of selecting Save As... try selecting the option Export or Save for Web. There you\'ll be able to control the compression of the file according to some configurations. Depending ding on that, your file may or may not have ""strange"" colors, but it\'ll play with the file size as well. Further reading about this is recommended.\nFor my comic, for example, I save it as jpeg/jpg at 72dpi for Tapastic. As it\'s completely on grayscale, I have no problems about.strange colors/tones.

It's usually recommended to draw the original 2 times bigger (or more) than the size of the final image. And are you saving your final images at 940px wide? That's the maximum Tapastic allows. If you save them smaller than this, I suppose it'll rescale the comic while viewing on mobile? That's why it may appear blurred. You may want to analyse at which resolution you're drawing (300dpi is for print, but it's good for any other thing too - I make my comic this way and only convert to 72dpi in the end but it's not actually necessary, don't bother with this) and who's your program handling text: if it's treated as text/vector or as raster."", ""I'd save the image not just as jpeg or a png, but specify the resolution and the size. So, work in whatever size that feels comfortable for you, and then - if you work in photoshop use the Save for Web option.

In Manga studio i export it into one layer as a jpeg and change the width down to what I want it to be (max 940 px for Tapastic)\nAnother option is to arrange everything in InDesign and export the document pages into jpeg instead of a pdf, it usually works out pretty neat I think.""]",8/23/2015 15:01,,,,,,,,,

Higher resolution means more image details.\nWhen creating digital artwork, most artists use at least 300 ppi, some go up to 600 ppi.

I tend to use it to get my pages to a resonable posting size when I finish them. : P', 'Resolution mainly has to do with how large your image will look when it\'s printed out in a hard copy form. On the computer, you don\'t necessarily have to worry too much about it, because digital images map to the screen on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Thus, whatever your digital image looks like on a computer screen is whatever the resolution of the computer screen is.\nPrint copies, on the other hand, don\'t have a standard ""pixel size"". There\'s no way to look at a piece of paper and subdivide it into indivisible units, because that would basically be the atomic structure of the paper itself. The resolution setting, then, changes how far apart each of the pixels on your digital image are spaced together. The term ppi and dpi both refer to the amount of pixels that will be crammed into a single square inch on a piece of paper.\nThus, if you have a really high resolution image, then that image will take up less space on the actual printed page than an image with the exact same pixel count, but a much lower resolution. Likewise, reducing the resolution of your image will cause that image to take up more space on the page when it is actually printed out. You\'ve got to be careful, however, because reducing the resolution means the image itself becomes more blurry. e.g. the individual ""pixels"" are spaced farther apart.']",8/16/2015 19:12,,,,,,,,,

I can't even refresh the page because it all freezes up only to eventually crash, and so I have to copy the URL, close the window, open up a new one and paste it to continue on reading (without liking anything or opening up descriptions unless I want it to crash again). I love to add to the number count, and am generally very patient with loading times so I've tried to struggle through reading and crashing the page every comic, but I know some may be deterred by that if they aren't experienced in such awesomeness that is Tapastic.

The email part isn't as important to me personally, but I wanted to report it too just in case it would help in some way.
I'm not sure if I'm alone on this, but I've received 20+ emails and counting tonight within 10 minutes alone, and most seem to do with private messages and the support system, and are from over a month ago. I'm used to emails for comments coming in at about 5-8+ hours after they've been posted, but something must've happened here? I wondered why I never got an email stating my support program was approved, and now it sent to me a month later.

I\'m not sure if Tapastic is just the main site that uses that plugin on my computer, but I haven\'t run into that issue elsewhere. And unfortunately it has been every page of Tapastic, or comic page since that\'s the time it slows down the most for me. The more pages I read and like, the more likely it is to crash every time. And to explain more about the page freezing - I can move my mouse around but not scroll or anything on the page itself as it attempts to load a like, upvote, or the ""more"" button in the description. I\'m not sure if it\'s due to binge reading because it seems to happen even on single pages for me. \nRegarding the support program, it was the Support $ publicly that didn\'t match with my dashboard.

Thank you for looking into this, and I hope that made a bit more sense!', ""Hmm... It's possible that the support amount shown publicly won't always necessarily match what's shown on your dashboard, due to supporters changing their support amount, canceling, or some other scenarios as you guessed. \nThe amount of support you're receiving / received for a given period is based on how much people gave most recently, whether they just started supporting you or recently renewed their support. If they edit the amount in the meantime, the amount they already paid for the current 30-day period remains the same, but the amount they will pay next time (30 days from whenever their last payment was) changes... and they can change it up or down as many time as they like until the date when their support renews. So there could be some discrepancies between the support you've received / are receiving this month, and what is essentially pledged for next month (scheduled to be collected). However, it could change before actually being collected if a supporter drops out or changes their upcoming support amount. Additionally, the day each person's support is renewed and collected is based on whatever day of the month they first became a supporter (not on the first of each month), so the can sometimes make things appear a bit off. \nWe'll look into the problem with Shockwave. As far as I know, we don't make use of that at all on Tapastic, so it's possible it's a problem with the ads or the plugin itself. I'll ask the engineering team!"", ""We did some testing and haven't been able to find the shockwave flash issue you're running into, and I don't think anyone else has reported the same situation so far. \nIt's true that if you read many comics by scrolling (so that you load one after another), the page can become sluggish, at least until you click to load a different episode or series, or refresh the page. We don't use Shockwave / Flash on our site, unless it's a problem related to the ads that are loading between comics for you. Liking and commenting shouldn't be effected, either (or have any impact on the speed of the pages for you), so it seems like there might be something else at the root of the problem.\nHere's something to check out and try, which may or may not help: http://blog.audioacrobat.com/2013/01/shockwave-flash-crashes-in-chrome-for-mac/1\nLet me know if that helps at all!"", ""I was wondering if it had to do with the month restarting, and that makes a lot more sense.

1341,Tapastic App Crashes when viewing my Comic,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"So I've had this issue since the new rollout of the app a few months ago. Here's the problem.
The Mobile version of my comic: El Cuervo: The Latin Assassin2 always crashes when I try to view it on iOS. I've had to go back to the episode, take down the images, resize them and reupload them at smaller, lesser quality in order to have them display and not crash the app.
This isn't ideal, as I've had to compromise the comic to the point of splitting the episodes in half, cutting out frames to reduce filesize and length and so on.
I understand that I am maxing out the specs listed: images no larger than 4000px long. So I've creatively arranged them to be under that. I have had some episodes that are 40 images long, but for the most part, each one is under 120kb. It's been pretty frustrating to display my comic on a mobile platform using your parameters and have it crash the app consistently.
I also understand that there needs to be limitations and conformity, but I've already gone above and beyond what most artists have done by assembling a mobile version from a standard page format - only to not have it display at all because it is too heavy...? My comic is in black and white, in pieces, with SMALL filesizes...
I've compared it to what I've put up on LINE, and I see that the images may be loaded dynamically? Never had an issue there (albeit, their overall filesizes are smaller).
Can someone look into this and give me some info. I'm really trying to make this work - but these limitations are really killing me.
Thanks!","['The app crashes for me when I do just about anything except the daily snack. Hope you find help!', ""Is the app still crashing when you try to load the comic?

I've just been browsing the Forum without finding a similar topic, apologies if it has already been covered.I tend to receive email notifications (new comments on my pages, posts shared by people I subscribe to, etc...) with an incredibly long delay (about 5 hours).Did anyone notice the same issue?","[""My longest wait was 2 hours so far and it's only very rare to get an email notification on messages with just a few minutes of delay."", ""It's typical to get notifications a few hours late, I get them between 3-5 hours after someone has commented or a new comic has gone up.

Probably the time it takes to write it down and get to the nearest post office ', ""I've found that it takes a certain amount of time depending on the type of notification it is, and some, such as creators sharing posts, take way longer."", ""Basically it has to do with the way emails are queued... not with any particular problem on tapastic's end (although the post office theory is not bad). \nTo avoid being labeled a spammer, we're forced to queue large volumes of email and send them in batches. If someone comments on your comic or replies to your post, you should generally get the notification email within maybe a minute or so of the action taking place. Other notifications (like for reading list / subscription updates) may have slightly different delays built in (in order to group similar activity into fewer emails), but should still be received within the hour (if not in minutes). The problem arises when something triggers a ton of emails at once, like a popular creator sending out an announcement to all of their subscribers (wall post notification, etc.), which in turn fills up the queue. Any subsequent emails are added onto that big stack, which is sent out one batch/chunk at a time. This can sometimes result in a backlog until things catch up, which is why a given email might be delayed a long time once in a while.\nThough the incredibly long delay experienced by @pthivillon (ex: 5 hours) can happen, it shouldn't be very common and certainly should not tend to be the usual case. \nHopefully that helps explain what's going on... We're constantly trying to improve performance as much as we can, but in a nutshell we'd have to spend a ton more money (to increase our capacity and performance) or be a much larger, better-known service to avoid this issue entirely."", 'I thought I was the only one dealing with this xD', ""Thanks for the reply, it's very clear...""]",6/16/2015 15:23,,,,,,,,,

Horrified, I clicked it again to re-Like it, and noticed the heart icon became red, while the rest of the button stayed grey.

For one, I suppose that the fact that the heart wasn't read when I first came to this episode was a bug.
For two... why did you do that? OnO

I don't like that button stays grey. It feels like something is incomplete and I want to click it again --whcih would be counter-productive. It's very disturbing.

The thing is with Tapastic, all of their ""pages"" are put on the front page for people to scroll down to, because it\'s built for simple mobile compatibility. Any other pages are minimal, such as the page to browse the comic feeds, people\'s actual profiles, etc. Anything else is usually accessible from the front page, which still has to stay minimal otherwise it would overflow the user with information all at once. \nI don\'t think blog pages have ever been that useful, tbh. People do use them, but when they\'re not around, people don\'t really -miss- them or even think of them. I know SmackJeeves had that function and I really had no use for it (then again, I didn\'t really like using SJ to begin with and ended up leaving it). A lot of the people here tell their stories through their comics; stuff that would usually be told through a blog. I feel like a blog section would pull the attention away from the actual comics and make it too much like Tumblr or something like that, y\'know? \nThat\'s just my opinion at least, I don\'t know how staff feels about that.', ""I'm trying to figure out how to delete this post lol"", ""Hi Uzuki,\nI've written this topic at another forum http://forums.tapastic.com/t/a-web-page-for-latest-posts/13373 \nPlease comment there because it's moved and I think this topic will be deleted .\nI will reply to you there "", ""Oh well I will reply here.\nSo basically what you are saying that Tapastic is just an app to update yourself with artists you already know. So then it's not the place for unknown artists?\nI guess I will have to keep on looking then -.-"", 'No, I\'m not saying it\'s not a place for unknown artists. I did not type that anywhere in my two paragraphs of text.\nWhat I said is that a blog function on Tapastic for individual users doesn\'t seem very appealing or necessary. I highly doubt it would be used that often or be used positively, considering as I already said, many people use their comics as their ""blogs"", telling their life stories through visual effects and drawings. And I don\'t know about you, but I\'d rather read a comic than a wall of text blog because then I\'d just go to Tumblr (and even Tumblr has been the origin point for many comics here, ex. Sarah\'s Scribbles). Also, a creator having a blog here wouldn\'t mean ~~instant success~~ because if their comic isn\'t any good, then they\'re right back where they started. There\'s just no point to it and that\'s not the point to Tapastic.\nHell, I was an unknown artist before I came here, as well as many others. So Tapastic definitely is the place for unknown artists if said unknown artists play their cards right and do what they can to get seen. Don\'t put words in my mouth for me.', ""Sorry, I got disappointed. I should have been more descriptive of why I said it's not the place for unknown artists.\nInkblazers had the best feedback from artist... Before IB, I was in smackjeeves and other websites that I can't even remember the names. I didn't have a response or have met as much artists as I did with IB. I know why this was and it's because unknown artist had a few minutes at the top of the list which gave us the opportunity to gain viewers.  \nIf you don't have this what is there in tapastic which will give advantage to unknown artists?\n-.- Maybe it's just because I'm new and still need to get used to this website."", '\n\nNITOmanga:\nMy suggestion is adding a web page which shows thumbnail previews of latest posts.\nYou mean a page for newly updated comics? I think this is a nice idea. This could be a step towards better visibility for creators. But I don\'t think it\'s necessary to make a whole web page just for that. I guess a section for it would suffice.\n\n\nNITOmanga:\nAlso a writer\'s blog page with it\'s latest posts.\nYes! Blog posts! I am not fond of making blogs but I do  enjoy reading them. \n Alright, *switches argumentative mode on *. Here is my point to affirm your suggestion:\nA comic hosting site is not just used by comic creators only\n       OK. I\'ll break down what makes up the community into three. First, we have the creators of a comic who are the artists and the writers, or most of the time the artist and writer is just one person.Secondly, we also have the readers who interact with these creators and give them feedback . And third, there are those users who plan on publishing their work in the future. They may double as creators too.\n\nFrom the perspective of a creator:  The creators may utilize the blog however they want. It may be about an announcement of their comic, a behind the scenes thing, or anything about their personal life. Don\'t forget that a creator is writer too so I could picture a majority of them would want this too. Personally, I enjoy reading the blogs of other creators (even if I don\'t follow their comic) because I learn a lot from them. They\'re the ones who post a lot of informative blogs for other creators.\nFrom the perspective of a reader: I\'ll connect this with the previous perspective. As a reader of a comic, I enjoy reading the blogs of creators. I get to know them as people instead of just ""creators"" of my favorite comics. I get to know them on a personal level. The majority of friends I\'ve met in a webcomic community are people who I\'ve first talked to in blogs. People who join purely as readers have a lot more time to write and surely they have a lot things to say. Having blogs would make another avenue for giving feedback. I\'ve followed users who don\'t have comics but I follow them because of their comic reviews, their own insights as a reader, and they even give recommendations. There\'s even this reader who makes blogs every Thursdays and people look forward to it. Yep, all his blog posts were about comics in general.\nFrom the perspective of a future creator.:  A user may just join a comic hosting site just to test the waters. They\'ll see how the community is like  and if they like it, they\'ll stay. I\'ve tested other sites and never stayed because I didn\'t feel like there was even a community at all. I only plan on using them as mirror sites in the future. Blogs-> more avenue for reader and creator interaction-> better sense of community-> people will stay.A lot of times, these future creators are writers hoping to partner up with an artist to make a comic. Meanwhile, they\'ll have these story ideas and they\'ll have no outlet for it. I don\'t think its proper to post those in the forums ^^;\n\nWell, that\'s all I could think of for now. I might have some ideas later after I regain all the limited brain juice I\'ve used.\n\n\nUzukiCheverie:\nA lot of the people here tell their stories through their comics; stuff that would usually be told through a blog. I feel like a blog section would pull the attention away from the actual comics and make it too much like Tumblr or something like that, y\'know?\nI\'ve missed them.Blogs would be obsolete on tapastic if that\'s true. However, you\'re only assuming that blogs are intended for telling stories  that could be told in comics.  Not all blogs (not even a mojority) are used to tell stories. Not all things written can be told through a comic (i.e. articles, comic reviews).I don\'t think blogs could pull away attention from comics. The blog part may only be presented as one of tapastic\'s features rather than its intended use. I mean, you can upload videos on facebook but didn\'t turn out too much like youtube because it still markets itself as a social media site even if it has that feature.\n\n\nUzukiCheverie:\nAlso, a creator having a blog here wouldn\'t mean ~~instant success~~ because if their comic isn\'t any good, then they\'re right back where they started. \nOf course.  But I still see the merit of this suggestion. Sure it doesn\'t bring ""instant success"" but there are pros of it to consider. A suggestion doesn\'t have to be about better comic exposure all the time (unlike most posts,lol). But maybe you typed that because @NITOmanga talked about it.', ""I actually thought about this last night, lol, and yeah you're right, a blog section is not such a bad idea, especially now reading your points about it.  Recently a reader pointed out to me that they didn't like that I uploaded sketches sometimes in between episodes 'cause it felt like filler. So having a blog post to share drawings and other behind the scenes stuff actually sounds like it would be a cool feature. I understand there's the wall posts for that, but blog posts would allow a creator to write (or show extra drawings, etc) at length and communicate more with readers."", ""Hm, we've sort of strayed away from blogs, we've even opted out of using our own blog in favor of interacting on the forums. Even the forums is something we're still trying to re-tool. \nWe can potentially just make the wallposts from individual creators more visible, make it sort able by update type (wall post, episode update, announcement, etc) on the profile page."", 'That would be great!

I have been using pixel because that is what tapastic uses, but when i change the canvas size to pixel the lines come out very pixelated regardless of what resolution it is. I was wondering if anyone has encountered this problem,what i use. Canvas size: 500x700 px resolution 600 ","[""the same goes for all drawing programs but as a general rule always work on a larger than necessary canvas like 1500x2100 (3x bigger in this case) and then when your done size it down to the size you want the final to be, in this case 500x700.\nI don't know how the resolution thing works because even if I set 500x700 to 600 resolution, I'll still be seeing 72dp resolution on the screen like usual..."", 'The resolution (dpi) doesn\'t matter unless we\'re discussing the picture size in inches. For example, a 5""x7"" image in 600dpi would be 3000x4200 in terms of pixels. But a 500x700 pixels image is always 500x700 pixels whether the dpi is 10 or a million.\nI\'m not familiar with SAI, but maybe this isn\'t specific to SAI; this might be a general resolution/size related thing. What are your canvas sizes, pre- and post-resizing? Both in inches+dpi and just pixels. \nI agree with yulius about working larger than necessary. Pictures almost always look better when shrunken, and you\'ll have more options for good quality printing, too.', ""It's not SAI related, you could encounter this problem in any drawing program which is pixel based.\nIt does matter what size you use even if it's in inches or pixels. For pixels you should always work in much bigger size then the final size, it's much easier to work in big sizes and better for your eyes.\nBut if you want to work in inches I suggest to work in printing size, and also if you make a new canvas in SAI, under the resolution setting in the Information field you can see how big it'll be in pixels. My suggestion would be if you want to go with inches set the Resolution to 300 dpi, that would give you a big enough canvas in pixels and also it'd be good for printing purposes."", ""Basically what everyone has said so far. Go for big, then shrink down. Don't start smaller than Tapastic's requirements because the dpi won't change that. Overall it's the size of the canvas in pixels that matters.

I guess this isn't something that's absolutely -crucial-, but every so often I'll find myself in a situation where I need to find the upload date of a certain comic - whether it's my own comic (which it usually is) or someone else's - and I can't get the exact date because it's just listed as ""something something ago"". 
It doesn't have to be to the exact hour or minute or anything, but if it could at least tell us when the upload date is when it's at least a week old, that would be helpful and make it less of this huge guessing game u o u I know some places will list upload dates (of videos or threads or whatever the content is) as ""something-days-ago"" until it's like, a few days old and they need the actual date.

However, we can consider showing the specific dates instead (at least for items more than a week old or something, for example). If anything, that\'s easier on our end. \nAs for the timestamp being different, I think that may be due to the server date/time being recorded rather than your local time.

1. Number format and the dollar sign My main incentive for downloading a .csv of my supporters/revenue is to import it into a spreadsheet editor and do calculations, but since the cells holding currency figures have hardcoded dollar signs in them, my editor does not see the cell value as a number, and as such I'd have to go in and remove the '$' from each cell.This is an issue for the columns labelled 'Amount', 'Fees', and 'Balance' in the balance details, and the columns labelled 'Status' and 'Total' in the supporter list.
A solution would be to export these figures as raw numbers, and have the unit clarification be in the column header e.g. change the cell label 'Amount' to 'Amount ($)' and the cell label 'Status' to 'Status ($/Mo)'
2. Date format inconsistency In the balance details, the 'Date' column shows the exact date, but in the supporter list, the 'Since' column shows only the month and year, even though on the dashboard it displays the exact date here as well.
3. The 'Fulfilled|EarnedRewards' column I would much rather prefer this column to be two seperate columns, so that I could sort after either. As it is now with both values in the same cell, the cell value is not interpreted as a number. 
Additionally, there seems to be a bug with the rewards here (for context, I recently added a new reward that was lower than my old Reward 1, and as such took the place as Reward 1, shifting the indices up by 1); In the .csv, all the supporters who previously has earned no rewards are correctly displayed as having earned Reward 1, but everyone who already had earned rewards have not got the new Reward 1 added to their count.

1443,Supporter only locked content,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"From what I'm reading, it looks like any supporter can open any locked content of the creator they support.  Is that correct?  I would like to be able to do it by tier.  You reached $5, you get this.  You reached $10, you can open this.
If that isn't an option, it should be.  Lets call it a feature request","['Sorry but no, this is not a good idea in every way.', ""I'm not so comfortable with this, as the support content is supposed to be little extras for those who wanted to support the creator, while a system like that allows people to make basically an online physical book, as they could lock each chapter behind another sum of more money."", ""Then how are you supposed to tier digital rewards?  I guess I can send a private message to the higher tier $5, $10, $15 reward earning with a link to the reward at an off site location, but how is that any better?  It takes the supporter out of the Tapastic site to some dropbox or similar site.  You also have to post numerous times rather than just once for that tier.\nI guess if you're worried about abuse, Tapastic needs to include rules in the terms of service that control it (they have to approve support plans anyway).  If a creator violates the rules, Tapastic can disable support or whatever penalty their terms specify."", ""The support program's already a bit like Patreon -- there's no need to copy it completely."", 'oh, i thought that was already possible :I shoooot ... that\'s gonna make it tricky for some of my rewards xDDD (wallpapers and such for $5 and up supporters...) \nJust to clarify guys, bpotts isn\'t asking for the function so that we can suck the money out of people - just to make it easier to tier the digital rewards and make it less PM\'ing and such for us. As I said, I have a wallpaper reward for people that\'s $5+ but that means that now it\'ll be available to those that only donate $1 and uhhh yeah, that defeats the point of the reward. That\'s just what the OP is asking, if abuse is an issue, make it a terms of service thing, etc. \nPlus I don\'t think anyone has used it to lock actual continuous episodes. I think the creator of the Reaper and the Girl does this but that\'s just for early access, then they\'re opened after. The only episodes that ever seemed to be locked these days are special ""behind the scenes"" episodes or unreleased episodes, etc. I haven\'t seen anyone dickish enough to just lock continuous episodes and ask for more and more money for them to read it. ', 'So I\'ve had a chance to consider this and I\'ll just demonstrate with an example.\nThe idea is that supporters donate a little each month to the creator.  Most will probably be small, a dollar or two.  If you are a supporter, you can read the locked content, ALL the locked content.\nMeanwhile, the support program is designed to allow the supporter to get greater rewards the longer they are in it/the more they have given.  Using my own program2 as an example, once a supporter has given $5 (could be a $5 a month backer, $2 for three months, a dollar for 5 five months) they reach the next reward tier.\nFirst tier, $1 given, I give them access to next week\'s episode a week early.  This is my locked episode.  If you\'re a supporter, you can view it.  If you\'re not, you get to see that you can\'t see it without being a supporter.  I\'m not sure I like that as it may turn off my long time readers (Why do I need to support now to see it?  Am I ever going to see it? etc.).  It looks like it also sends out the new episode email to all subscribers, who now come in expecting the new episode and are confronted with this support to view message.  Really don\'t like that.\nSo, now it\'s been a few months and I have some who\'ve reached the $5 amount.  I\'ve promised to give them a glimpse into the creative process of the next chapter.  I might want to post them a script page, design art, pages in progress, whatever.  How do I get it to them?  I can\'t just lock it, because the $1 people can see that stuff and this is for $5 people only.  I don\'t even want it in the regular flow of comic pages because that will mess up my story flow, and I\'ll have locked pages in the middle of my free pages, which would just be ugly.\nWhat I wanted to do was set up a new comic, with every page locked at the $5 level.  This is where the $5 supporters go for their sneak peak, but as I can only lock, not lock for $5 rewardees, I can\'t do that either.  I end up having to build something off the Tapastic site and messaging the supporters saying, ""Hey, come to this website and get your reward.""  And I have to figure out how to control access to it, send them passwords, dropbox links, etc.  It gets really ugly really fast, especially as I plan to put new material here on a regular basis.\nNow, lets say a creator decides to be malicious, or a criminal network hires a creator to make a comic for them and sets up a support plan.  They contact the supporter, ""Hey, come download your reward here.  Use this password to open the password protected self-extracting zip and get your PDF.""  The unsuspecting supporter opens the PDF and gets their reward, not knowing that there is now a bot running in the background, crawling their computer for email addresses, passwords, joining them to a botnet, etc.\nJust from a security standpoint, it\'s in everyone\'s interest that Tapastic keep this stuff onsite and that we use our Tapastic logons to access the material.  They can run virus software on their databases to keep malware off the system and block password protected zips and the like.\nAs for the pay per chapter, sure, someone could do that I suppose.  Tapsatic would have to decide if that was allowed and what to do about it if someone violated the rules.  At $10, I offer the supporter access to a few stories I was never planning as part of the main webcomic.  Again, I\'d set up another comic, all pages restricted to $10 rewardees, called Supporter Exclusives or some such.  I don\'t want these exclusive pages in the middle of my otherwise free webcomic.\nTo not allow tiered locks breaks the whole Creator Support system and makes the tiered rewards (that Tapastic built into the system) extremely difficult to deliver to supporters.', ""Completely agree - I just went to start setting up my own locked content and realized there isn't a tiered system, so it looks like it's going to end up being a lot of extra work for me to manage - which defeats the purpose, really.\nA tiered option is going to have to be a requirement in order to make this a successful venture."", ""I just got my 3rd supporter, and they chose to back for $10 a month, immediately hitting my first three tiers.  No tiered lock, I now immediately have to figure out how to get rewards to them.  I'd hoped for a few months to work it out.

It gets a notification out and keeps the numbering and organising consistent, and then after some days (after it has served its purpose of notifying subs), I delete the dummy ep.\nUltimately, I would like Tapastic to expand on the publishing options, specifically with a choice between Add Episode and Append Episode, so we could add pages to the latest chapter and have that count as an update, and that the subscriber notification would take them directly to the new pages so they wouldn't have to scroll to see the new pages."", ""@AtokNiiro Thanks for this third option, on how to proceed ^^ it's not optimal as you say, but it's a decent compromise.

Think about all the links being shared on social media, by bloggers, and word of mouth - even when we\'re at conventions, we are actively pointing people towards specific series. \nJust a random example, but think about seeing Fail By Error on 9gag  (or any other site really) and let\'s say that the poster has (lord have mercy) included the original source or maybe there\'s a watermark that just says ""Fail by Error.""

Think about all the things that define Tumblr: rapid reblogging, liking and aggregating your likes in one place, suggestions of blogs you should be following based on your tastes.

Since almost nobody is on 640x480 these days, I used it as an example of a type of users who've become so few that you could (and should) just ignore. As you said, it's impossible to cater to everyone.\nMy point of mentioning that was, the people who arrive at Tapastic's index page before seeing any of the comics here -- are they as few as the unfortunate souls who are somehow still on 640x480? I'm guessing they're few enough. Like I said, I don't have the data and I might be just biased because I happened to be one of them.\nTumblr as a whole is a terrible place (for the kind of stuff I like doing), but that's probably getting off topic.\n(Sorry, I don't mean to be argumentative; I do appreciate you answering my concerns, even though it doesn't necessarily mean me getting what I want.)""]",8/21/2014 13:16,,,,,,,,,

The tiny button at the top was pretty confortable while I was following 4-5 comics, considering the scrollable list that appear on press is just 3 comics wide. Now that my reading list grew it's pretty unpractical to scroll and scroll to find the one comic I want to get back to(provided I recognize the comics mostly by the thumbnail, rather than the name).Wouldn't it make sense to move the button to the top-right corner of the screen (switching place with the search button) and have an (overlay?) sidebar appear when you press? The sidebar could be as big as the whole page. That much space could be also split: the top part could be harboring the reading list (scrollable), the lower half might as well contain a bunch of suggestions - a selection of ""what you might like"" comics based on the preferences/subscribed comics.I think it would be a huge improvement  Cheers, D.","[""Just in case you didn't see: http://tapastic.uservoice.com/forums/176534-general/suggestions/5749811-bigger-reading-list-dropdown8""]",4/9/2014 12:52,,,,,,,,,

1471,“Why Aren’t you Updating”–I’ve been updating! 3 times a week! Help!,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"  So, I draw a manga--or comic book--rather than do comic strips.  To update my comic across the web, three times a week, Mon/Wed/Fri, causes me to sometimes encounter errors.
  Since I began using Taptasic, I noticed that it never says I've updated when. . .I just did.  Or later when I update again.  Now Taptastic thinks I can't meet my deadlines--all because it's not announcing the updates?? o_O
  When I update, I add a single page to a chapter.  Since I'm not adding entire ""episodes"" at once, this is my only theory of why my updates aren't counting.
  I'm pretty sure making an ""episode"" per page is a bad idea--but how else can I get my updates seen and logged correctly? ;A;","[""there's a schedule to be followed? I didn't know that.. O wO"", '^^^^^ Not necessarily, however Tapastic does pay attention to that sort of thing. It\'s especially necessary for #Primetime publishers; ability to post on update days according to schedule is a must because those update days are the days readers are awaiting to read your stuff, obviously lol There are some comic series here on Tapastic that have stopped updating pretty much without reason and haven\'t been updated in months lol So while there\'s no rule saying you have to follow a schedule (unless you\'re a #Primetime publisher as I already stated, unless you announce a reason for being gone ex. sickness, vacation, etc.) it does help readers ""rely"" on you a bit more as an artist and webcomic author and it just overall looks better (: (and it helps the artist get stuff done on a regular basis if they discipline themselves to said deadlines). Meeting your deadlines is probably one of the biggest acts of respect you can have for your readers, IMO. You could have a comic that\'s crafted by the hands of God, but if you upload very sporadically between months and weeks at a time, it doesn\'t take long to lose readers\' attention, no matter how good the story is.\nThat aside lol @OP, it\'s probably the reason you stated why it\'s not saying you updated. Adding episodes (which in most comics, would be individual pages or strips or segments) is what notifies readers of updates - editing a current episode and adding a new file does not. So my only suggestions are: \n\nMake each page longer (so that there are two-three ""pages"" per episode, for ex.) \nMake an episode for each page and title each episode by page number (quite a few manga-style stories do this; something like Ch.1 - P.1, Ch.1 - P.2, etc.). The only downside to this is that the users will be notified each time you upload a page, so they could get brand new episode notifications for 4 pages you\'re uploading at once. \n\nSo I kind of strongly suggest the first option. Group your pages according to importance or cause-to-effect or whatever structure you see fit (feel free to check out some manga stories that do this just to see some direct examples) and then upload those together as individual episodes, then title them something like Chapter 1 - Pg. 1-3, Chapter 2 - Page 4 - 6, etc. \nThat\'s just my suggestion though. I don\'t even know if that\'s what you necessarily meant but if it is, I hope that helps (: Do whatever is comfortable for you and works for your readers so that people don\'t think you\'re ignoring your own deadlines haha', ""@XexiliaZajacAdding pages to a pre-existing episode does not alert us that you've been active and thus triggers our auto-responders to send you a friendly reminder. If you are updating than please ignore the e-mails, it's just a part of our system So, updating a pre-existing episode with newer pages is fine, if you feel that it helps with the overall reader experience of having a chapter condensced into one episode that's great, keep on keeping on! However, it won't bump your series in the RECENTLY UPDATED section nor will it send out notification e-mails to your readers. Meaning less traffic or less user engagement. Just something to keep in mind. @UzukiCheverie Thanks for the amazingly detailed response, you're a life saver!@SaiKyon No, there aren't necessarily schedules to be followed, but like @UzukiCheverie mentioned, the content team does look at a publisher's track record when we take Primetime into account - we just like to make sure that publishers can regularly update on a consistant basis and keep fans happy  \n"", 'aw okay.........O wO']",3/10/2014 10:17,,,,,,,,,
1472,Email Notifications / Way of checking answers etc on the website,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hey there
Since I try to keep my email-account from overflooding, I was deactivating the Email Notifications. As there was only the possibility of Yay or Nay to Emails only turning them off was an option.
Now I am wondering if I get any notifications on the website itself, (when someone comments on my comics or when I get an answer to one of my comments). I already noticed that there is no special notification if someone added you to the reader list or likes a comic. Of course, Maybe they are already planned to be implemented and I know this can take time.
One other thing i was wondering was, if there could be a possibility of a regular scheduled email notification instead of ""whenever something happens"". For example I say I want to have a weekly email, that I get an overview of events that happend in that week.

1473,Best format of comics for mobile devices,Tech Support | Site Feedback,[],"Hey there.
I just recently started to publish my comics here on tapastic and I like the fact, that this website is specifically optimized for mobile devices. In fact, that was one of my main reasons to join Tapastic.  
The thing is, my comics9 are usually gag strips with 3 to 5 Panels each and I usually arrange them horizontal. My first test with my Adnroid Smartphone shows it is then necessary to zoom in on the comic.
I am now considering changing the layout to give each panel a row on its own but I am not sure if the amount of scrolling necessary for that would possibly be a bother for the reader. Especially if the panels get too high and you don't see it completely on most devices. (Changing it now, at the very beginning wouldn't be so much of an effort, so fast input is appreciated  )
So, basically I'd like your input on what you think the best layout for a comic would be in terms of readability on a mobile device. Or the best size per panel / height of a row. (I lack the necessary devices to simply try it out on each one of them). Or what your general experiences are so far.
Thanks in advance= Vertixico","[""The world is definitely shifting towards mobile phone/tablets. Personally, I don't think scrolling down 3-5 panels should be too difficult. On any mobile device, reading horizontally is going to be difficult too. 1) They need to rotate their phone horizontally. 2) They need to scroll horizontally. These would be about the same effort as quickly scrolling down. Or at least, that's my opinion.""]",2/6/2014 16:48,,,,,,,,,

For example, I could name my lists as ""Reading"", ""Plan to Read"", ""Lolzorcake"", etc.
Side note: Anyone on Goodreads? I'm suggesting a list system like that. We'd still have the reading list that includes all the comics we added.
