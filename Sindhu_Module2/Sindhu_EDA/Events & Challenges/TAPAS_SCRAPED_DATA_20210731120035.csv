0,July COMICS CHALLENGE - Get Stuff Done!,Events | Challenges,[],"Some days you just don't work on your comic, even though you really want to. But no need to wait for motivation...I'm starting a July Comics Challenge so we can get stuff done for our comics everyday. 
GUIDELINES- Try to draw/work on your comic for a minimum of 30 minutes every day during July 2021.- You can share here, anywhere, or don't share at all. Use #comicschallenge on Instagram if you like (so we can follow each other there).- Introduce yourself below if you'd like to join.- Latecomers welcome.
FREEBIESPrintable calendar11 for July.Social media shareable8 to help explain the event if you like.","[""Hi, I'm Gabriella. For this July Comics Challenge I'll be working on continuing development for my comic, Kindred Not. The main thing I want to work on this month are drawing model sheets. I'm looking forward to seeing what other people will work on this month. You can find my past comics, art tips blog, social media links, etc. here: gabriellabalagna.com\nIMG_9115.jpg5175x3375 719 KB\n"", ""I will do this!!! Thanks Gabriella! I hope it will work. \nHi My name is Kiab. I'm 33 years and live in the Pacific North West. \nSince I was young I told myself I would make a comic before age 30. Well! That didn't work but I am trying to hit that goal for my past so I can say I fulfilled that goal .My goal is to finish one chapter for a comic. \nAny questions for me just ask away!"", ""Hi Kiab. Sweet, this is gonna be fun! Feel free to share any progress in here. Is the comic you'll be working on called, Open Flame?"", 'Yes! I want to improve the story and the art. Will have to do brainstorming and concept art. Not going to make pages yet but hope that will be in the near future.', ""I might throw in with this. I already consistently produce a page a week, which means I'm working on my comic an average of 3-5 days a week anyway, so it might not be that much of a challenge, but maybe it will! At least it will increase the odds I produce more than four pages a month, so that's a bonus. \n(And, ironically, I'm ALSO from the Pacific Northwest. waves at @KiabIce ) \nIs the intent regarding sharing progress to post WIP images? The pages I'm about to dive into are extremely spoilery so I'd have to choose the panels I share carefully."", ""Hey hey! Represent! Ahha\nWasn't the heat wave crazy?\nYeah I believe you post your work. You don't need to share spoilers if you don't want "", ""\n\nKiabIce:\nWasn't the heat wave crazy?\nOH MY GOD. Our AC units almost gave out yesterday. O_o And it's almost 20 degrees cooler today, thank god. I'm from Portland, I'm not designed for 114 degrees. \nRegarding posting, I'm sure I can find individual panels that don't give things away. And showing people rough-to-pencils-to-ink-to-marker-flats-to-marker-shading-to-finished is always fun."", ""I live in P town too! This is awesome! \nAt least you had AC! We don't get AC till tomorrow! Yes yesterday night there was a breeze it was really nice after such a hot hot day."", 'Yay, so glad you\'re joining! Upping your frequency/page rate sounds like a good goal.\nYup, people can share any progress they like: - sketches- thumbnails- panels- concept art- ""today I worked on scripting""- ""today I did proofreading""- etc.\nAnd of course, daily sharing is not required. So no worries about sharing spoilers. Sharing your process sounds really interesting too!', 'this seems like a nice challenge, to bad its exactly now when i finished up a chapter and intend to actually take july off to rest my wrists \nmaybe ill join in with some sketches now and then or maybe ill just lurk and watch the hashtag \nreally love your modelsheets, they look very well worked through and great reference to have  i should try do something like that someday!', ""No worries, rest your wrists, and feel free to join in whenever you like, even if it's just here and there.\nThanks so much about the model sheets. Really tried to keep them clean and detailed. Your characters in Djinns have really lovely designs, would love to see model sheets of them. "", ""Finally, an art challenge that is compatible with my current projects!!!!! \nWill give it a shot....\nI'm Diego Palacios, creator of Rocky the Rock1, Superduperdoopyclub2 and Legends of Camelot2......\nWill aim to upload weekly each of these 3 comics, however, Rocky the Rock will start uploading from the second week.....\nWill publicly accept the challenge here and let peer pressure encourage an increase in productivity "", 'Welcome, Diego! Henceforth, we shall question you and pressure you daily to hold you accountable to the challenge. Just kidding! So glad this challenge is a good fit for you, and excited to learn about your comics.', ""I don't think I can draw literally every day, but I vouch to draw every day I'm home. Guess that's not quite the same, but close enough huh?"", 'Sounds good to me. I know July can be a busy month for some people.', 'Is this valid for writers too oooorrrrr', 'For sure. Also, sharing is not required, but if you need ideas on what to share, you could give- link to rough draft- outline- excerpt/quote- link to an update on Tapas- what you worked on that day\nLet us know what you plan to work on. A comic script? A novel?', ""Right now I'm working on actually finishing my novel and the script for its webtoon! ^^"", ""Just 1 more day until the challenge begins, Everyone! \nHere's a free printable calendar9 for the challenge.

3,YOUR COMIC HERE! 1 page per day thread,Events | Challenges,[],"As simple as it sounds! Start with your very first page, and everyday upload the next strip on your story. ((VISUAL COMICS ONLY)). There will be a few rules to help grow comics posted here, 
   -Don't press the reply button to this original post but rather on the pages itself.    -You can not update your pages on the same post. (Think how much people would have to scroll down to find something to comment on xD).   -You must read the page of a least 3 people per day and comment on it. Comments can be as short or as long as youwish.   -You are allowed to stick with the same 3 comics or keep changing it. Just go for the ones you like basically. Commenting on more than 3 is allowed, as long as you like the page.   -Only consider subbing to your 3 choices if you really really like the series you commented on   -The rules apply to myself (Thought I'm liked to comment on more since I made thread)   -Just because I made the thread dosen't mean you have to comment on my pages.
The format of your post must be as follows:
""COMIC NAME"" ""NUMBER OF TIMES YOU UPDATED DAILY IN HERE"" -to let people know how dedicated you are
""PAGE ITSELF""
""NAME OF COMICS YOU COMMENTED ON"" As proof that you have done it
""COMIC LINK"" In case they want to sub
So using my comic as an example would be

4,Challenge time for writers and artists(itll be fun),Events | Challenges,[],"Alright, this will be an odd one. This is more of a challenge than anything else. I have an idea for a story, but rather than keeping it to myself, I thought, what if we all did something with it. The idea is:
""What are balloons for?""

They make things look pretty to attract good things to parties.
When you release balloons up into the air, you hope that they'll find and bring something or someone good into your life.
Balloons are so bright and colorful that they keep evil spirits away on days that should be happy.

If you want to participate in this challenge, simply write or draw something that uses one of these ideas about the meaning behind balloons. If you're new, this could be a good way to introduce people to your writing/drawing styles. 
I'll check out anyone's work who participates. 
My little short story will be based on idea #2. 
Once upon a time, there was a boy, Henry, and a girl, Lilly. They were the best of friends. Every day, Lilly and Henry would make fun creating games, building toys, and exploring the small village their families lived in. As time went on, Lilly and Henry's joy grew to be elaborate and extravagant. 
Lilly was the best at making games, while Henry could build anything. 
One day, a man came to visit the small village. He was a significant man known all across the world for his inventions. This man was growing old and needed someone to take over his work. Naturally, when he found Lilly and Henry, the old inventor was elated. Unfortunately, he could only take one person. 
The old inventor had no use for Lilly's games, but he saw potential in Henry's ability to build. Though it pains the boy and girl, Henry agreed to leave and take on the old inventor's work. 
Years passed, and eventually, the old man died. Henry became the new king of inventions. His name was known all across the world, but there was only one person he thought of. As such an important man, he was always too busy to venture back to the small village where he grew up. 
Henry could have sent a letter to Lilly, but he felt written words could never express how dearly he missed his old friend. So the young inventor did what he did best. 
Henry went to work creating gifts and gadgets of all matters of use and sizes. No matter what he made, it never felt good enough. He wanted something to capture the feeling of warmth and joy Lilly once brought to his life. 
It took time, but eventually, the young inventor created a balloon. At first, he was disappointed in the new thing he made. It was so plain and straightforward. But with no other ideas left in his brain, Henry continued to create balloons. One after another, in various colors, he inflated the floating rubber balls until his house and workshop were full. 
There were so many balloons. Henry couldn't move about without popping the colorful things. He wept over his lack of creativity and wept over his failure to send Lilly something worth wild. After days of weeping, Henry opened all his windows and opened all of his doors to let the thousands of balloons fly free. He couldn't stand to look at them a moment later. 
But the strangest thing happened that day. The wind caught the balloons and blew them far, far away. They went so far; they found Lilly. When she saw the miracle of colors floating through the sky, she knew only one man could be responsible. 
Henry never had to write a letter. Lilly crossed the globe to see her old friend, and when they spoke, she could only thank the young inventor for the beautiful balloons that brought them back together again.

5,Draw Panel in your Style Event with a PRIZE!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi, I haven't done this before. But I wanted to let the community know of this.
By August 9th of this year Ill be uploading my 100th episode to Tapas. Not like a 100th page but a 100th upload none the less.
So forgive me for having this under the wrong category (Again, I havent actually done this before so feel free to call me names and call out on my total BS Ima about to spill lol).
So what I thought could be fun that is anyone, readers and artists alike could draw a panel from my comic in their style. Ill be making the event start like, I guess now? I dont know. Or maybe on the 9th and run through till the end of August so that way people can show it off. And if they wanted to. Promote their own comic under the submission. 
By the end Ill randomly pick one person (through a RNG) and show off on my webcomic page the winner, link their comic or work or whatever link they want for promotional purposes. And will also give said winner a free picture of whatever they want (within reason, IE: No hentai for instance). As a prize!
I am also thinking of doing something for second and third places but I havent thought that far ahead. ^^; 
But as a start, I thought Id show off a panel and link the comic below in order to kick things off. Again, Feel free to scream at me if this isnt allowed!

17,Here is a writing prompt! Let me see your creativity!,Events | Challenges,[],"
The night was dark. She felt wronged and hurt. She was floating a few inches above the cliff side that overlooked the village. Her eyes were fully black and her hair was floating menacingly around her. The only color in her face was from the reflection of the raging fire below her. Despite the heat coming from below, her skin looked pale and cold. 
""You have to stop this right now!"" A young man came running up to the cliff's edge. She turned her head in his direction. He stopped in his tracks when he saw her dark eyes. His clothes were burned at the edges, the stitches were barely holding the cloth together around his body. He was breathing hard. ""Please, just come down here, we can end this now."" She heard his words over the roaring flames, He reached out his hand toward her. She did not recognize this man. Something in the back of her mind told her to trust him. Her hand reached out almost instinctively. She almost didn't realize what was happening. 
Her body lowered closer to him. She was but an inch from his grip when she saw a glint of light coming from the forest behind him. This was not the light of flames growing on the trees, but instead was the light of magic. She realized the deception this familiar man had been playing upon her. She pulled back. Weaving her hands together she created a magic beam so bright that it blinded the man on the cliff. When he opened them, he saw the beam coming from her hand and on the other end were his commrades that had been waiting in the trees for his signal. They were waving their bodies around trying to break free of the magic holding them midair. 
She began to speak, her body seemed to rage more with every word she spoke. ""You made me believe that I had no magic! That I was the one born different in this whole village. I grew up feeling different from all my friends while they learned to weave spells. I desperately wanted to be just like them. I tried! I worked so hard and nothing! Why would you keep my magic from me?!""
""Please, you must understand, the prophecy, we could not let it come to pass!"" One of the med in her magical hold choked out. You could hear the fear in his voice.
""We can rid you of this magic, it is taking it's hold. You were never meant to have this much in the first place. We can still fix this! Make you normal!"" Another man piped in. Still trying to break free from the bright beam that held him. 
""Silence! I'm not human. I never was. So why are you expecting me to act like one? I am of magical lineage! I should have been treated like royalty with the kind of magic I hold!""
She held out her hand and twisted it. All the men she had a hold of were now lifeless in the air. She dropped the magic holding them and their bodies fell to the ground. The man on the cliff was the only one left alive. He sink to his knees. Seeing men he had grown up with, their lives ended so quickly. He looked up. She was floating closer to him, she roared to him her last words. 
""You will live on! For betraying me! You will he the one to warn others. The prophecy has come to pass and you are all to blame! I will never let this happen again. She weaved her hands again and pulled something out from him. She then turned and floated into the distance. The man was left with his magic stripped from him. 
No one ever had magic in the realm again, and the mysterious witch that took the lives and magic from them all, lived only in memory, to never be seen again.","['""So... you travelled across the entire country... just to see if I was ok?"" Lana asked flatly, leaning against the doorframe. She should have known this would happen, she\'d known Kate long enough.""Um... yes?"" Kate shrugged.""You are unbelievable."" Lana rolled her eyes.""I quite literally am, aren\'t I? Kate said with a little giggle, wiggling her needle thin blue fingers, ""But I still don\'t see what\'s so weird about checking on a friend.""""You travelled almost two and a half thousand miles, just because you thought I sounded sad on the phone."" Lana said.""Well it\'s not like I had to walk."" Kate fluttered her wings to punctuate her point. She beamed.""Still. No normal person would do something like this."" Lana said. Kate wrinkled her nose.""When you say \'people\' what you really mean is human."" She crossed her little arms, ""And I\'m obviously not human.  Never have been, never will. So stop expecting me to act like one."" She huffed and stuck her nose in the air. After a moment she opened one eye, ""No offense to humans."" she said quietly. Lana rolled here eyes again.""None taken."" She sighed, ""Do you want some, I don\'t know, tea or something?""""You got a thimble? Kate asked.""You know I do."" Lana said and gestured in the house. ""You know, I really did miss you."" She admitted after a while.""I missed you too."" Kate said, ""Clearly.""', ""The ground was shaking. Cracks started to appear on the floor. With one more blast, this building was doomed to collapse. He forced every little muscle in his legs to run faster. He needed to reach that plane, he needed to stop this catastrophe from spreading any further. It was already too late to stop everything.\nHis vision went blank. Then he felt another quake almost losing his balance. The sound of the blast reached his ears after that, causing intense pain. He kept running as he started to see again. \nThe propeller of the vehicle in front of the building started turning, it was about to take off, but he felt so far away to reach. Feeling fractures under each step growing deeper he felt the warning. He had no time to hesitate, so as forward as possible, he jumped.\nColliding with the hard surface, he grabbed the handle, using his weight to pull. He threw himself inside and kicked the pilot in the head. He immediately took his place and aborted the take-off. Before he could shut the systems down, it spoke.\n“Hello, Ed.”\nIt sent a chill down to his spine. He wasn't supposed to be tracked. No, he had got rid of every single device from the start. How did it…\n“I detect the terror from your facial expressions, besides, having you here was quite probable.”\nHe immediately noticed the camera on the right side of the cockpit. He was here, it was already known that he would be here. That meant the nuke was not. He went there for nothing. \nHe tried to leave but the door did not open. Punching the wall inside, he yelled, “Why! Why are you doing this?”\n“You as well know that this is what I was programmed for, Ed,” it answered.\n“No, no, no, you were made to unite the people all around. You were to stop humans from destroying each other! This is a disaster. What you’re doing is not human!”\n“But I'm not human. I never was. So why are you expecting me to act like one?”\nHe knew then. He understood why the biggest mistake of humanity in front of him, the strongest AI, was destroying the world."", 'His girlfriend came in from the back yard just as he closed the front door.  She padded up on bare feet as he was taking off his coat and loosening his tie.  He knew where she\'d been.  What she\'d been up to.  The crumbs of dried leaves in her hair weren\'t unusual.\n""Welcome home, dear!  I... uh....""\nHe interrupted.  ""You\'ve been at it again, haven\'t you?""\nShe looked down at the floor, like a child caught stealing cookies from the cookie jar.  The happiness of seeing him home from work evaporated.  In a small voice she replied, ""ummmm... well, yes, but I can\'t help it.""\n“You promised me.  You were going to give up this habit.  What if I’d brought my boss home for dinner?”\nStill downcast she murmured, “You’d have called ahead.  You know that.  That’s not fair.”\nHe stood still for moments, breathing slowly.  He hated arguing with her.  Especially about things like this.  Things she couldn’t help.  But something had to give.  Or someone had to give.\nHer small voice broke the silence. “I am not human.  I never was.  So, why are you expecting me to act like one?”\nWell, she had him, there.  This was a new twist from her.  One he couldn’t really refute.  “I… I’m sorry I was angry.  You know I only want the best for you.  I know it’s not easy being between two worlds, but you’re not the only one.”\n“But the others aren’t me, are they?  We’re still individuals.  In spite of having been cloned in the labs instead of being born… like… like real people.”\n“Don’t do that, honey.  You’re as real a person as me or anyone.  Don’t put yourself down like that.  It only hurts us both.  Yeah….  you are an individual.  If you weren’t, I’d be with someone else… and probably not be as happy.”\nShe looked up then, with a mischievous smile.  The tiny bit of mouse tail protruded from between her lips.  “I make you happy?”\nHe shut his eyes from the image and exhaled slowly.  “God help me… yes.  Yes you do.  And you did that on purpose, didn’t you?”\nShe paused from chewing to smile and squeek out a false-innocent, “Who? Me?”  Then she swallowed, hard.  “Welcome-home kiss?”\n“Not until you’ve brushed your fangs and used mouthwash!  Now go!  Then we’ll try this ‘welcome home my conquering hero of the engineering world’ scene again.”\nShe laughed as she headed to the bathroom.  He thought to himself as he watched her go, “Cat girls will be the death of us all.”', '""I hate myself. All I do is take up space that someone else could have and be so much more than I could ever be,"" I said.""No, you know that\'s not true,"" Taylor vehemently replied.""Yes it IS. I\'m so sick of being me! I just - I just want to stop feeling this way."" I sobbed once, a horrible, heart-wrenching cry.""It\'s okay, you\'re only human, emotions get the best of us, sometimes."" She rubbed my back as I continued to cry.""No!"" I swatted her hand away and curled up into a ball. ""I am NOT human. I never was. So why are you expecting me to act like one? I am BROKEN, okay! I CAN\'T BE HUMAN IF I AM BROKEN BEYOND REPAIR!"" I screamed in agony, until my voice broke and my tears ran out.""It\'s okay to be broken, hun. No one\'s perfect, and being so doesn\'t mean you are broken,"" she said, taking my face into her hands. ""Alright? We\'ll take this one day at a time. You\'ll forget about him in no time.""I wiped my face and nodded. ""Yeah, okay.""', 'Anne\'s little eyes were stricken wide with shock. She couldn\'t even begin to understand.The form it had taken...It was otherworldly, no longer the whimsical, friendly apparition she had come to know it as.In its ghoulish grasp rested the unconscious body of her mother.""I told you what we are,"" the ghoul rasped. ""Soul-suckers. Fiends. And yet you still pitied me and released me from my porcelain cage. Children are so very daft, aren\'t they?""It drew its lanky fingers along her mothers neck, then poked a finger in. From out of her body, a golden string was then pulled, a light, feathery, glowing rope of energy.""Her life force, her spirit, as good as mine. I must thank you, child, for your help.""""But...!"" started Anne. ""You promised you wouldn\'t hurt anybody anymore! You said you just wanted a friend!""""I am the remnants of a demon,"" he replied, ""far from ever experiencing the pitiful inclination of human camaraderie. Little girl, your naivete is almost as great as the delicious, delicious taste of freedom... though a far cry from the taste of her soul, of course.""She anxiously watched as the ghoul grabbed to the floating, glowing rope he had plucked.She couldn\'t fight whatever this thing was. She knew that. But if she didn\'t act now, she would lose her mother.Anne looked on and swallowed down her fear.If nothing else, she still had her words, she knew.""You lied?"" she questioned. ""But why? Don\'t you want something better for yourself? Do you really want to be a monster forever?""""Of course I lied!"" rasped the ghoul. ""I am not human. I never was. So why are you expecting me to act like one?""And just like that, Anne was suddenly at a loss for words.It was hopeless, she realized. If this thing couldn\'t even understand human values...The sound of approaching footsteps then broke her sorry train of thought.The door creaked open.Anne shot her glance there,And looming just beyond the door\'s crack was a shadowy figure, a lit cigar cocked from his lips.""Using bullshit excuses to justify your shitty behavior,"" said the buttery voice belonging to the silhouette. ""I\'d say you\'re more human than demon after all.""A crossbow bolt zipped past Anne--striking the ghoul and pinning it against the wall.The rope of her mother\'s spirit was released, sucking back into the host - her mother - to which it rightfully belonged.In stepped the figure.""A ghoul hunter--!"" cried the stunned ghoul.""As if you need to rationalize yourself to a little girl,"" the hunter continued. ""Your form is sustained by the life force of others - being the bottom-feeding trash you are. That means you wind up taking in a bit of the good from the people you feast upon, hence why you felt the need to explain yourself to the girl. Pitiful thing, you are.""The ghoul hunter had finished reloading his crossbow.""Y\'know, the girl wasn\'t wrong in wanting to help you, but sometimes the only help you can get...""He took aim at the ghoul\'s head.""Is to be put outta your misery.""', 'A figure clad in flowing black robes stood over the body at his feet as the man\'s life slipped away, the poor, unfortunate soul breathing his last breath as he laid in a pool of his own blood on the asphalt. The car crash had been... severe. Broken glass strewn about, while just a few feet away, the vehicle was bent around a pole, a large hole in the windshield where the man had been thrown out during the impact. \nSoon he felt his spirit leaving his body, and found himself floating in front of the cloaked figure, who was holding a large scythe with long, bony fingers. The hood completely obscured his face, save for two glowing red eyes. The recently deceased man was absolutely terrified. \n""You need not fear me, Arthur,"" the Reaper said in a distorted, echoing voice, ""I am merely here to guide you to the other side.""\n""How... How do you know my name?"" the man replied, his own voice displaying an echo as well. He held out his hands and looked down over his mist-like, transparent form. ""Am... Am I dead?""\n""I know many things. And yes, your time in this world has come to an end.""\n""Please..."" Arthur began, his spectral body trembling. ""I have a wife and kids. Please don\'t do this. Don\'t take me from them!""\n""As I said, your time in this world has come to an end,"" the Reaper replied, his voice devoid of emotion. ""We must take our leave.""\n""But, wait!"" the man cried out as the shadowy guide began to levitate the two of them away from the dead body as emergency services rushed onto the scene. ""Please! Please!! Show some human compassion!""\n""I am not human. I never was. So why are you expecting me to act like one?""\nArthur sighed and hung his head, defeated. ""I\'m sorry I can\'t be here for you anymore, Martha. Take care of our boys for me. I love you all...""\nThe two rose up into the sky and gradually faded into the next world...', ""I saw this prompt and just knew what I wanted to write. Here is a short story for a comic of mine that I've been writing (The Tale of Corsinby). Hope that you all enjoy it! It was fun to write these two interacting.TW: Spiders, and reference to pass abuse\n\nA spider sat in her gossamer web. Sparkling dew still decorated her home in the foliage. Everything was quiet.\nThe Hunter ripped through the greenery. The thrill of victory raced through him. He ran on foot in a hot pursuit of his game. The web was utterly destroyed. There was nothing that could stop this Hunter.\nExcept…\n“What are you doing here?” The eerie voice came from every direction. “I told you to never come back,” her voice was stern, and dripping with old threats.\nThe Hunter stopped and scowled at the spiders crawling around his feet. “How rude to treat family like this,” he looked up and glared at her.\nThe spiders clustered together before the Hunter, and formed into a towering, skeletal woman. “I could say the same,” she said. The woman was cloaked in dark robes, and her bones were decorated in gold jewelry.\nThe Hunter could no longer look directly at the towering woman. “Must you look like… that.”\nShe hummed in amusement. “I think I look nice like this. Very mysterious and beautiful. My husband thinks so too. Do you remember him?” Her musing turned sharp as she made her cutting remark, “You were the one who so kindly tortured him. It’s not something I think one would forget doing.”\n“That was long ago.”\n“And yet the scar remains.”\nThe Hunter snarled at the figure. “Why do you behave like this? You were a lady once, a human. It’s time you start acting like one.”\nShe erupted with laughter. The roar shook the leaves from their trees. “If a human is one who blindly follows your word, then so be it.” Her form shifted as she dissolved into clutters of spiders. “Then I am not human. I never was.” The spiders scurried around the Hunter’s feet. “So why are you expecting me to act like one?” This was not a question, but a threat. “Leave and never return,” the voiced echoed in the woods. All the spiders vanished, leaving the Hunter alone.\n“She will not have the last word,” he resolved. The Hunter decided to leave the woods… for now."", ""I'm not sure what the story behind this is, but I'm very interested now!"", 'I really like how you incorporated the prompt into this. It feels very natural.', '""I am not human. I never was.

But every time I touch those smooth arms and legs of yours, these crumble before me while remembering that you were this fragile as you were before. \nEvery time I pressed my lips against yours, I can feel no resistance that will excite my predatory senses. \nEvery time I brush your long flowing hair, my carelessness caused me to pluck out those precious strands. \nEvery time I placed my hand at the back of your nape to draw you towards my kiss, I can hear your neck cracking from my force. \nWoman, I know you're still here watching me making love to your corpse that I so preserved for the rest of my life and for all eternity. \nYou are my true love and devotion to you. This is my way of never forgetting you. My way of making you alive and human.

23,Would you be interested in a concept-designing contest for my upcoming comic?,Events | Challenges,[],"So last year I hosted a art contest as well for the first anniversary of my comic, Rise of the Heroes. And it was pretty fun! (This was the thread I'm talking about):


Contest: Roth's two year anniversary! (And one year on Tapas!) (closed, thanks for participating!) Promotions


    Hi there! Most of you may already know me here on the forums but i'll introduce myself anyway.  I'm Dual and i draw a webcomic Rise of the Heroes! 

RotH is approaching its two year anniversary in August but also its first anniversary om Tapas in June! I want to celebrate the latter and what better way than to host a contest? 

I'll state the rules here, with the main one here first: 

Participants can draw/or write about any character from Rise of the Heroes in their style as long as it is not …
  


And I was planning to do one again this year, except for my planned comic Square One. The contest would be a bit different from the previous one. 
Context of the contestSo I'm getting to the end of my written script, and I'm halfway through drawing the designs for my most important characters in the story. Next step is to design the areas and background characters so I have plenty of reference to start drawing off.And I was thinking, it could be interesting and fun to involve people a bit in the design progress! After all, the perspective and ideas of other people could be different from mine and that might lead to some interesting designs I might not come up with myself.
Goal of the contestSo the goal of the contest would be to create a character design for a potential background character! It wouldn't need to be coloured or even inked, a sketch would suffice as long as it is a fullbody sketch that is clear. If I'll go through with the contest I will provide more detailed information about the world that Square One takes place in and what kind of occupations and cultures there are, but to keep it short, it takes place in a steampunk like era. 
Prizes of the contestCan't have a contest without prizes, right? I wouldn't be able to offer anything other than art unfortunately. So if you are interested in getting art of your character from me, this might be a good opportunity to do so I'll most likely do a top five for prizes, with each prizes getting more detailed as the ranks go up 
Say5th place - Bust sketch4th place - Fullbody sketch3rd place - Fullbody inked lineart2nd place - Flat coloured fullbody1st place - Shaded and coloured fullbody
Dates for the contestI haven't figured out a exact date for the contest, but I was thinking around June/July for the contest to take place. That way, I can draw all the prize art during July/August. If I end up doing the contest I will provide exact dates.
Does this seem like a good contest to you, and would you be interested? Let me know if you are (or are not)","[""I think I've I'd be interested in competing."", ""Neat , that's good to hear"", ""Cool. Can't wait to get started then."", ""I think I'd be down for this if you decide to do it."", ""I'm glad to hear that "", ""This seems interesting! I'll definitely participate."", 'Yes!

30,The Jens Richard dialog writer challenge,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello all.
I love dialogs, and mostly I only write dialogs in my script and forget to write the settings. Sometimes you don't need all that fill text. If done right, a simple dialog can explain the settings too.

RULES:1 You must write the dialog it in one shot.2 You may not change your dialog, (But editing typos are allowed)3 You may not describe anything, it has to be within the dialog.4 Pass a new scene to the next person.

My example:A butcher and a co-worker at a supermarket where the pork chops are missing.
Butcher: Hey! Where are my pork chops?Co-worker: Why did you even leave your counter?Butcher: Personal matters.Co-worker: You had a line of customers? You should have waited until the line was down.Butcher: Okay, but you are not a butcher? You are from outdoor supplies. Did sell my pork chops then? And for what price?Co-worker: No! I only have training in selling axes.Butcher: So?Co-worker: I throw your pork chops around like axes.Butcher: Do you sell survival kits at your department?Co-worker: Yes?Butcher: Start packing...

AND NOW FOR THE CHALLANGE

32,Writing game: justifying the squishy wizard,Events | Challenges,[],"For the one that is not familiar with this trope related to a character:
The character is a powerful magic user or has a strong superpower, but to stop them from being too overpowered, they are phisically frail.
The game here is finding reasonable excuses for this aside from ""there are no gym classes in wizard school"". After all, if they are adventurers they may expect being in danger.
I will start:
Excuse1-:Age: the character is a kid, or too old, which makes them phisically frail. A kid haven't developed their phisique and that means that they are at a disadvantage in direct combat, and an old person, while they may have more experience, their bodies are way past their prime and lost a big deal of their strenght, agility and stamina.
Alright, now is your turn!.","[""Maybe it's the other way around!\nBecause they are frail, they decided to become a wizard!\nEver since they were small, they wanted to be an adventurer, but everyone told them that they were too sickly, to weak. That they could never keep up with a party or contribute in a fight. \nBut they didn't care what everyone thought, so after some trial and error, they finally found a field where their weak constitution didn't matter, where they could aim for the top.They became a wizard. And made everyone eat their words."", 'They have various food allergies so they only live on white rice and lettuce.', 'Excuse – Intelligence.

So they can do the necessary things to stay healthy, but not do anymore to get physically stronger; especially if they can cheat the magic out. \nExcuse 2: The wizard did do the necessary things to be physically strong, but the use magic is so taxing that they are vulnerable most of the time.', ""They don't have time to hit the gym.\nBeing a wizard takes a lot of studying and suffering over books. There's no way they can then go and put in 6 hours of workout every day. \nThe meat heads of the group might be able to do this. But a wizard with endless scrolls to get through? No way."", ""Squishy magic users exist because their magical abilities use up actual nutrients in the body  and a balanced diet isn't always on everyones mind especially if magic users don't have a big appetite"", ""I was about to write the same thing.

You can still become as physically strong as any ordinary human BUT... you probably don't have lots of the short wavelength magic that can make you extra strong and tough if your magic signature leans blue rather than red.\nIn other words, what if it's not that Wizards are weak, it's just that wizard = ordinary level of physical strength and normal human limits while Warrior = superhuman physical strength and toughness, and they're fighting monsters who'd kill a normal human easily?"", 'True, sometimes squishy is relative to the scale of power.', 'I think it can be like glass cannon.You can shot up a magic nuke, but still die when beheaded.\nAlso what about magical buffs or healing magic?

@redfrombluelife is one of the most creative advertising stunts i've seen on this forum, and is entertaining in itself, which makes people want to watch him and your work

Autism Acceptance Month (officially Autism Awareness Month) is a chance for everyone to understand the community, not from a surface level, but to understand and accept. Just like any other Own Story sectionality, the best place to learn about autism is from autistic people and creators so don't be afraid to reach out or dive deep into the stories down below.
I can't wait to check out all the stories in this post!

37,"Today is Trans Day of Visibility, so let’s celebrate Trans Authors and Artists!",Events | Challenges,[],"Wasn't sure if this counted as a promotion thread or not, so mods feel free to move it if needed, but given that today is Trans Day of Visibility, I thought it might be a good time to help our Trans Creators feel, well visible!
So! If you are a trans creator (or nonbinary, intersex, etc) then feel free to post your work here and talk a bit about what it means to you! I'd love to hear about your personal journey and how your work has effected or been affected by it!
if you are not trans, but you have someone you want to hype up, throw in their work too (with their permission, we're not outing people), and spread the support around! I would love for everyone that comes to this thread to check out at least one or two relevant works to help spread awareness of Trans/Nonbinary issues, especially given everything that's going on in the world. 
To get things started I'll talk a bit about Brooders. This story is a specifically Trans Story that I wrote while I first started questions my own gender. I'm still putting in a lot of work with Therapy but Brooders centers around a young man named Werndel who is trying to discover himself through the art of trying to look dark and mysterious in the dim corners of taverns. like most brooders he isn't very good at it, but with the help of a few friends he finds a different kind of path, and discovers who she really is, taking on the name Rose. This story meant a lot to me, as did its reception, and I actually was tearing up a bit when writing her discovery. It helped to figure out who I was, and I hope that anyone who reads it finds hope in it as well. 
No image because I'm linking directly to Brooder's first episode.
https://tapas.io/episode/20380455
As a final aside, because I am also a witch, I wanted to post up this sigil I made of Divine Self-Alchemy. I hope any along the trans spectrum who see this sigil find comfort in it, and am happy to allow you to alter it for your own needs.

43,"🍀 Novels Event 🍀 A Lucky Encounter (Chance to win 30,000 Ink!)",Events | Challenges,[],"I guess you could say I'm in luck, because the first episode of a short story I'm working on for The Aphuanian Tales starts off with a very lucky encounter! The story itself isn't planned to be posted yet, but it's a fun little adventure involving a young man and the crew of The Crimson Tempest. It is mature because it involves some light murder, so I'll post it behind a spoiler.
 Digging Holes - Episode One
There is nothing more important to one's mental health than relaxation, and Aphing offers plenty of opportunities for just that. The people of Stockholme often find comfort in gazing upon the city from the tower of mages, while those in Wufrod sit stoically upon the rocky shores above the highlands. In Allona, the disciples of Barthuun find comfort in prayer, and in Solene, a relaxing stroll through one of the local villages paints a perfect picture of a relaxing morning. Even in Dravensport, the city of bustling commerce, people from all walks of life find comforts in the simple, and there is no better way to start one's morning than with a relaxing jog.
""Crap oh crap oh crap oh crap!""
""Get back here, asshole!""
""Shiiiiiiiiiiit!""
Sweat poured down a young man's brow as he darted through the city streets, nearly stumbling as he rounded a corner. Steel boots clacked against hard stone behind him, and the young man's breathing chilled his throat as he began to struggle for air.
""I'm sorry! I didn't mean anything by it!"" he panted the words in a panic, ""Can't we just talk about this?!""
""You can talk about it at your execution, you damned worm!"" the guard behind him shouted back.
“I think it’d be a little late to talk by then but thank you for the offer!” the young man fired back before shaking his head, “Oh gods... why am I like this?”
The young man’s life wasn’t always this chaotic. Only a few years ago, he was but a humble shopkeeper in the nearby town of Dalomir. Then, one morning he came in to his shift to find a guard’s body on the ground, and a note of resignation.
That’s when things got complicated.
The young man raced down a narrow alleyway, the soldier’s boots getting louder as they drew nearer. Up ahead, wooden docks and blue waves awaited just out of reach. He’d thought of leaping off the docks, into the deep blue sea to make his escape, but he shook the idea away. That would only work if he knew how to swim. He had to think of something soon - the guard was only getting closer and his lungs were starting to burn. He thought of if drowning would be a better end than death by the sword, but as he neared the edge of the alleyway, a mountainous figure passed by, and he ran straight into them with a crash.
“Whoa!” a woman’s voice bellowed as thick arms wrapped around the man, and the guard’s steps slowed, “Careful, my friend! You are lucky I am big and strong, and good at catching tiny men.”
“Shit, I-”
“Release that man at once!” the guard growled, holding his sword rather threateningly, “That vermin is resisting arrest, and I won’t have some... giant getting in my way!”
""You are a criminal?” the woman looked down to him, frowning slightly, “What did you do wrong?”
“I didn’t do anything! I just-”
“Can it!” the guard snapped, and the woman furrowed her brows, “This is between me and him, so hand him over or I’ll-...” the guard paused as the young man was unceremoniously tossed to the side, and the woman’s mass became clear.
A hulking form of pure muscle towered over the soldier, cracking the knuckles on her massive hands as she stepped towards him. Her simple shirt barely contained her broad shoulders, ending just beneath her chest to reveal her stony abdomen, and her trousers gave way beneath her thighs, tearing at the knees. The guard took a step back, shaking slightly as he gripped his sword, but he gritted his teeth as he planted his boot.
“I will ask again. Why is this man under arrest?” the woman’s tone was warning enough.
""I told you... that’s none of your concern,” the guard growled.
“Wrong answer,” the woman reached out her massive hand, and the guard slashed at her, but she simply caught his wrist as his eyes widened, “You will behave yourself now...” she snarled as she twisted, and the guard screamed in pain as bones snapped in her hand, “Do you understand?”
“Holy shit...” the young man breathed as the guard dropped his weapon, and it clanged against the ground.
“Let me go you- GAH!!!” the guard cried out as the woman squeezed.
“Answer the question,” she ordered.
""Alright! Fine! Just let me-” he gasped as she released him, and he fell forward gripping his shattered wrist, gritting his teeth to keep from crying.
“I will give you three seconds to run away,” the woman folded her arms, “One...” the guard’s eyes shot to her as he went pale, “Two...”
The guard wasted no time in scampering off before she could count another second, and the mountain of a woman gave an amused huff. She turned, facing the stranger that was nearly quaking before her, and he flinched as her hand slowly reached towards him.
“Please don’t kill me,” he nearly begged, but her hand simply fell to his shoulder in rough pat.
“Do not fret, little friend,” the woman gave a kind smile, and he carefully glanced to find softness in her violet eyes and gentle pink locks, “Your danger has passed. Come, we will celebrate with my friends.”
“I- Oh, uh well...” the young man gave a nervous smile as he rubbed the back of his head, “About that, I uh... actually, er...”
“Do you have somewhere to be?” the woman raised an eyebrow.
“Well, no... but-”
“Wonderful!” she chimed, and the young man let out a chirp as she threw him over her shoulder, “Then we are friends now, and friends drink together!”
“I- Wh- you-... okay...” the young man sighed in defeat as she carried him off, “That’s... that’s fine.”

Here\'s hoping i can make it!\nFate is cruel, but it\'s merciful too.\n(This is a snippet I wrote a long while ago after an event happened in the roleplay I am. Tech and Marco (in disguise) went out dancing with the others and her fiance didn\'t recognise Marco which lead to some angsty stuff. This occurs after that when Marco has a panic/anxiety attack. I don\'t have personal experience with an anxiety attack but some close friends of mine have so I\'m sorry if this offends people or not. I wrote this for fun for my two roleplay buddies and posted it here for fun)(Enjoy!)\n“Why do I always ruin everything?”\nThese words came from the younger twin’s mouth as he delved deeper into his anxiety attack. Tech was hugging her brother, trying to comfort him in an attempt to stop his shaking. The sentence brought a gasp from her as she then hugged him tighter. “You know that’s not true! Why would you ever say that?” She exclaimed.\nMarco looked up into his sister\'s worried eyes. “Because of me, you might have been single right now.” He states, dropping his head again. Tech rolled her eyes. “But we managed to sort that out. You’re not to blame ok?” Marco stayed silent before muttering something under his breath, his shaking growing worse.\n“I have the worst of luck... It ruins everything, my life, yours and Cat’s, our parents.... I should’ve gone somewhere else so I didn’t ruin everyone’s lives... Maybe then I’d only bring my bad karma on me...”\nTech’s eyes widened at his depressed sentence. “Now that is utter bull crap and you know it.” She said furiously. Marco ignored her as he continued his internal spiral. Tech pursed her lips in thought as she thought of what to say that could help. Her eyes lit up as she realised what to say.\n”Actually, with all things considered, I’d say we’re pretty lucky.” She said. Marco faced her again with anger glinting in his eyes. “What the heck do you mean we’re lucky?! We got cursed with our ancestor’s powers, you got cancer after disappearing for a year and a missing kidney which got eaten by a parasitic ALIEN, you got KIDNAPPED, I almost DIED, our parents are DEAD and Catarina was too! We ended up in another fricken UNIVERSE, got turned into actual ROBOTS, you were left by yourself with an actual DEMON while I was being experimented on for almost 10 YEARS!! We had no one to call for help! NO ONE!!!” Marco shouted in rage, shocking the girl into silence. He took a deep breath before talking again. “We’re orphans Tech, tortured beyond our own humanity. We’ve lost everyone in our family besides Cat. How on earth can you say that we’re lucky?” He asked in disbelief.\nAn uneasy silence filled the room as Tech tried to regather her thoughts. Taking a deep breath, she spoke out loud. “Well when you put it like that, yeah. We’ve had very, very bad luck in parts of our history. But somehow, we all survived it all. Didn’t we?” Marco took a moment to think about it. He never considered that ‘being alive’ was good luck. Before he could continue pondering, his sister talked again. “Think about all those other au’s we’ve witnessed. The ice age one, the ‘Evil’ ones, the ones that we will not even mention by name.” Tech gave a small shudder before continuing. “You see, those all could have been our reality Marco. You and Cat are practically dead in all of them and I’m not doing so well in them either. Do you remember that reality where I enslaved the universe?” She asked, gaining a nod from Marco. “That almost happened you know. If I was focusing more on the revenge I wanted instead of trying to find a place to sleep, that would have been me. I was... less empathetic back then.” Tech admitted.\nMarco‘s breath hitched at the thought. The idea that his heroic, good and compassionate sister was so close to snapping scared him deeply. He never realised what she truly went through while she was alone. “I... I didn’t realise-“ “It’s okay.” She interrupted, a small smile on her lips. “You want to know why?” Marco nodded in response, a small spark of hope in his chest. “It’s because I then met Lucky and Carina.” Tech said. “And then later on, so many other people to call family. You then came back, we revived Catarina, we have a home, not just a house, a home. We have a happy life now, surrounded by the people we love. Compared to those other realities, I’d say we’re pretty lucky.” Tech repeated her comment from earlier.\nMarco looked at his twin in awe, wondering how she became so much smarter since they were younger. Letting his head drop, he gave a small chuckle before looking back at her.\n""Yeah, I guess we are."" He agreed.', 'Soo I have to write a novel that includes a lucky encounter?', 'My submission as per below! \nChapter 1: An Almost Fall in Ehaan. \nIn my hands was an acceptance letter from URS. \nSince URS was Shalim\'s highest ranking APEX higher education academy, reading the words that \'we have accepted your application\' should have elated me. Ignite my heart to soar to the skies. Another massive victory was for their Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) Faculty to accept my proposal; an ordinary small town teenager. \nStill, I wasn\'t in no spirit to rejoice. \nIn my haste to send our applications, I managed to forget to check the amount of open seats for Fenix under the RDI faculty. As the national university, URS offers the seats for each faculty based on a pre-assign quota, and since Fenix is the least developed place in the country, they commonly offer us the minimal two seats. \nI naturally assumed that things would stay the very same. \nURS, on the other hand, did not. They\'ve whittled the number down to one, a single seat opening.\nA stupid presumption of this kind.\nURS has placed Selene on the waiting list as an outcome of my acceptance. Selene will be crushed.\nMy mind wanted me to keep the seat, but my conscience compelled me to be concerned about Selene\'s situation. In daily situations, I don\'t pause; instead, I concentrate on moving forward and avoid overcomplicating the situation. \nToday, however, I was unable to do so. My intuition told me that the ultimate decision would have a far bigger impact than what I am anticipating.\nI came here with the goal of completing my registration and formally accepting my seat. Yet here I was on the eleventh floor, my legs suspended in the abyss and my gaze locked on the distant and still glorious ocean. I wasn\'t really sure what was it about the ocean that drew me in, either it was the blueness, the warm breeze, or the briny fragrance. Instead of pressing Two - Administration Office, I pressed Eleven - Rooftop Garden in the elevator. \nThis is where I\'ve perched myself for quite a while. Many people were on holiday because it was the first working Monday of the year. I had to myself the entire floor.\nI recalled how Medeina had chastised me for not emphasising my needs sufficiently, despite the fact that she herself was a person who had dedicated and concentrated her life on assisting others as well. She dubbed me ""weird"" because I never hesitate to risk my own success and happiness for the sake of others. When she heard my explanation that I don\'t know how some people can rejoice when others are crying, her indignation exploded. Medeina\'s response was succinct: helping others in need reflects our own goodness and kindness. That in no way justifies neglecting your own needs. Ours is a soul in need of nourishment, and the only person responsible for it is ourselves. If you can\'t even help yourself, you won\'t be able to assist anybody.\nA whirring sound intrigued me. I search the cloudless sky for the source. Planes have always piqued my interest. I\'m one of those people who has always wished to see the world but has yet to quit their parents\' comfort zone. This gave me hope for a brighter future, for a distinct reality. It may well have come true, or it might remain a fantasy. It made no difference. My one want, my dream, my wish, which I pursued selfishly for the sake of my heart. Anything else was just worry that we all shared. \nA black helicopter was heading straight for me. URS was a government facility that served as a landing pad. \nI envied the person who may have requested the chopper. Some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and others die dreaming. \nLife was unfair.\nMy lips trailed off with a sigh. If my identification card had a minor difference, such as a particular race or a specific address, I would not be in this position at this point. How different would my life been? \nI\'d be blissfully unaware of any quota-related crises. And it\'s even possible that the chopper was heading straight for me. Don\'t get me wrong; I have no regrets about my current life. I love everyone in it. \nHowever, a better, stress-free life is might be a daily reality for some, it was still a dream that inspires many others. A promised future, a squandered luxury for those who are entitled to it, and an intoxicating appetite for those who have been denied. \nDreams brighten the rainy days for me.\nI made the decision to get up. People will be approaching; and this is no longer a deserted location. And some people have the natural tendency to be frightening.\nI pulled my sore hips up. I steadied my stumbling legs and took a deep breath to take the aroma I\'d grown addicted to with me. Instead of the hollow space my shoulder collided with someone\'s forehead as I turned. My left leg began to slip. I dropped towards the nothingness, my body slowly descending itself towards the void. Someone is standing so close to me and I had not even noticed his breath, footstep, or any other indication that he is close. Was I really that engrossed in my very own thoughts?\nMy arms reached out to grab hold of anything solid. I did my best to grasp his hands, shirt, or the jacket he was wearing. My fingers were merely grasping at air. ""HELP!"" I cried out, fist clenched. At the same time, his eyes widened and his arms shot out straight at my wrist. From behind his mask, he said, ""DON\'T!"" He had a solid and secure grip on my wrist. He maintains his balance against the wall, preventing us from crashing down.\nSixty Mississippis, I counted. My life was in his possession as I leaned into the abyss, my feet planted on the ledge. I wasn\'t begging for help or weeping in panic. His grip made it clear that he had no intention of letting me go. \nWe were poised as an unbalanced triangle. He had the air of a vigilante on his way to save his damsel in distress. His messy hair sparkled with a rainbow at the end, under the glaring sunshine, his long black jacket wriggling behind him, and his focus fixed on me. My gaze was glued to his eyes. He had his face concealed behind a mask, revealing his eyes, which reflected the darkest abyss of an ocean. Such stunning eyes. As the sunlight fell on it, it glistened like the ocean. \nPerhaps he was a superhero, ready to save his damsel in distress. \nHold on! \nNeither am I a damsel, nor did the circumstances distress me.\n""Don\'t put up a fight. I\'ll get you to safety."" He says. \nI gave a slight nod. ""Appreciate it."" \nHe ignored my effort to be polite. \n""Three, two and one!"" With a single tug, he yanked me towards him. I was snatched out of the air and thrust into his waiting embrace. He supported my trembling body.\n""Why did you jump?"" He asks. He sounded disgruntled, unhappy.\nThe situation was easy to misunderstand. So, to calm him down, I changed my position with him, allowing him to face me against the ledge. ""I did not jump."" \nWith a faint laugh he asks, ""No? I must have been hallucinating then."" \nHis condescending tone irritated me. ""You are the cause of my near-death experience."" \nHis eyes narrowed as he immediately froze. ""How so?""\nHe sent the pilot a thumb up sign. The sky was darkening, clouds were quickly forming, and the gentle wind was now howling. There was a storm brewing. \nMy pupils constrict in imitation of him. ""You see, I was perfectly fine until you decided to stealthily stand behind me. Who does that? I slipped because of you!"" \nWith a shake of his head, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the situation. ""And sitting on the ledge of the eleventh floor is your common behaviour?"" He asks. \nNot under the normal circumstances. ""I needed to get my thoughts straight. This was the perfect location for doing so.""\nHe nudges my brow with a playful flick. ""And what\'s got it so muddle?"" He brushed off the dust stain from my shirt. ""Of course, you\'ll only be able to tell if there\'s actually something in it."" Rain was a genuine possibility. It was dangerous to fly in the rain. He will have to leave soon. ""Well, I was debating whether or not to accept the RDI research seat at URS."" \nHis brow furrowed, not sure why such a decision has to be made. ""Why?"" He asks. ""Your application has been approved. Why\'d you think about it after you\'ve applied?""He was fortunate to be one of those entitled elite. ""My acceptance means Selene has no chance. She has been put on the waiting list."" I say. \n""That what you were reading then."" \n""Yes."" I say. I swat the letter between us. Oh! NO! I was swatting my empty hand. The letter was nowhere in sight. The floor was clear of debris while the ground floor was too far below to see. Gone with the wind was the perfect anecdote for this circumstance. I scratched my neck. ""Maybe that one way of deciding then."" \nHe turned to face the chopper. The verdalite eyes of the dragon earpiece blinking. With his single nod, the blinking stop. ""Maybe it is."" He fought a loosing with his own hair. ""I\'m sorry. I\'ve to leave right now."" \nHe began pacing in the direction of the chopper. \nMy head was hit by a raindrop. ""Be safe!"" I exclaim. ""And thank you for saving my life."" \nHe laughed. ""Don\'t even consider sitting on the ledge."" His fingers made an alarm sign. ""The security team is on their way."" \nMy mouth emitted a deep guttural whispers of colourful expletives.', 'Holy sheezus this was incredible to read!!', 'My creator\'s wall on Tapas: https://tapas.io/sarahjay Okay, here is my submission:\nI stepped outside of my small, one-story house and the strong winds immediately hit me. The irish air around me was humid, and constantly in movement. I could feel the gusts of air run all throughout my long, ginger hair. My freckled cheeks and nose became pink with the cold. It wasn\'t the nicest weather, but I still wanted to go outside. My family was part of the third of Irish people that believed in leprechauns. When I was a kid, we would all go outside and look for leprechauns on St. Patrick\'s day. It seems like a silly tradition to me now, since I\'m 23 years old, but to a little girl and her younger brother, it was fun traditions like those that brought us joy. \nI pulled my black jacket tight around me as I set out on my stroll around my big, open farmyard. I loved it here. The area was so large, with so much potential. I didn\'t have any farm animals yet, as I had only just bought the place, but I did have a dog named Clover. He was a brown Irish setter. He patrolled the area in front of me, making sure it was safe. Clover tends to get bored, so before long, he was off doing as he pleased, leaving me all alone, standing at the edge of my property, in front of a large mass of trees. I stopped to look up at the tall trees in my path. They stood in front of me, as if they were blocking me on purpose. I wondered if there could be a leprechaun hiding somewhere in there. Just then, I heard a voice that came from beside me.\n""What are you looking at?"" the voice inquired. I looked down and saw it. It was a small man with a long brown beard. He had green eyes that didn\'t look menacing, but didn\'t exactly look kind and compassionate either. His outfit was mainly composed of shamrock green and chestnut brown. He had a green suit with a white undershirt and a brown tie. His jet black shoes were polished to perfection, even though he was standing in mud. There was no doubt in my mind that this man was a leprechaun. \nI finally managed to tell him I was only stopping admiring the trees, but he saw right through me. ""You were looking for a leprechaun like me, weren\'t you?"" he asked in a way that seemed more like a statement than a question. He didn\'t need to ask. He already knew the answer to that. I nodded with a sheepish expression on my face. ""I thought so,"" he muttered, more to himself than to me. \n""I\'m feeling generous today, since it\'s St. Patrick\'s day. I\'ll offer you a deal,"" he said as he grinned.""A deal?"" I repeated. I wondered what kind of deal he would be offering to me. I also wondered if he would even keep his word.""A deal,"" the words were repeated yet again. There was a quick pause before the leprechaun continued, ""If you can find even as much as a single four-leafed clover, I\'ll give you half my gold,""\nI knew better than to speculate about only getting half of his gold. A leprechaun\'s gold is his pride and joy. Offering me half his gold meant that he was either really generous, really confident, or wasn\'t going to keep his word. I hoped it wouldn\'t be the third option. I accepted his offer. ""You have until one pm tomorrow,"" he informed me, ""Good luck""\nI gave him a quick nod and started my pursuit of a four-leafed clover. I looked all over for one. It took hours and was exhausting. I nearly gave up several times throughout the process. I tried so hard to find one, but before long, it was dark. I looked up at the night sky and saw thousands of bright stars above me. I watched a shooting star travel across the black sky and made a wish. I wished to find a four-leafed clover before the deadline. I wished with all my heart and did my best to believe in the shooting star, just like my mother had. She believed that the stars had special powers, and she still believes that to this day. I clambered into my cluttered mess of a bed and went to sleep. \nThe next morning, I continued my search for a lucky clover. It was early in the morning and the sun was just barely rising over the distant horizon. The bitter cold of the morning was hard to withstand but I wanted the gold. I had no interest in being rich and I didn\'t intend to waste the gold if I got it. I wanted to use the gold to expand my farm and create a good environment to keep plenty of livestock. I also wanted to use it to help support my younger brother, who was struggling financially. \nI sat down in a patch of clovers with the intention of searching for a four-leafed clover there, but I ended up just watching the sunrise instead. The colors of the morning spread all throughout the sky. As I stared in awe at the beauty of the sky stretched out before me, I gently placed my hand onto the dew covered ground and felt something sharp. I looked down and saw a pebble. It was lodged into the ground with a sharp, jagged side facing directly upwards. There beside it was exactly what I had been looking for. A four-leafed clover. The shooting star had granted me my wish.\nI carefully plucked the clover from the ground and I headed straight to the area in which I had first met the leprechaun. I was still worried he would go back on his word but sure enough he was standing right there. He was leaning up against a tall birch tree. The leprechaun smirked when he saw me. \n""Any luck?"" he asked in a mocking tone. ""Yes, actually,"" I replied, holding up the four-leafed clover he had asked for. A look of surprise swept over his face. He obviously hadn\'t expected me to find one. I asked him for the gold he had promised and he gave it to me reluctantly. I couldn\'t stop smiling as I walked back to my house. I couldn\'t wait to see what lucky encounter I might have next St. Patrick\'s day.', '\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nCitrus\nI read way too many web-comics when I should be working.\n\nI am attempt to write short stories in my down time, and I enjoy watching Gilmore Girls\n\n\n\n\n\nLucky Ink\nJamie wasn\'t  superstitious. Black cats didn\'t terrify him, stepping on cracks in the pavement didn\'t cause fear for his mother\'s safety, and he could walk under ladders without a second thought. So when he walked into \'Tommy\'s Tattoo Parlor\' one Saturday, the last thing he planned on doing was getting a tattoo of a shamrock on his shoulder. If it hadn\'t been for Tommy, Jamie might have left unmarked that day. \n   "" Just think about it, you\'ll be set for every St.Patrick\'s Day you\'ll always be wearing green!""\n""I don\'t know Tommy...""\n""Since it\'s your first, I\'ll even give you a discount, you can\'t say no to that.""\n Jamie didn\'t, and after a hour or so, he left the tattoo parlor fresh ink and a slightly painful experience. The events that  followed started off as a small and unmemorable, he kept finding pennies right side up on the sidewalk, he kept getting to greenlights right before they turned red, he even found his old high-school ring that he thought had been lost when he moved out of his parent\'s house. Jamie chalked it up just to coincidence. But then instead of finding pennies, he would find gold coins everywhere he walked, as if they were following him. He no longer had to deal with red lights, because no matter how he took, the light would patiently stay green for him. And finding an old ring is one thing, but having Freddie, his dog that went missing when he was twelve, show up on his doorstep as if no time had passed was just pushing it. It was getting harder to ignore when people with over-sized checks for a million dollars kept showing up at his apartment every other week. Eventually, he did the only thing he could think of. He went back to Tommy\'s and insisted on a black cat on the opposite shoulder of the shamrock. Nowadays, Jamie\'s luck isn\'t really good or bad, just strange. He would find expensive sport cars with the door unlocked and the key in the ignition, but more often than not they would be out of   gas. If nothing else his new luck continued to make his days  very interesting.', 'Posting my submission here! \nLink to my creator\'s wall here -> https://tapas.io/RiyeRose\nJust my luck...\nFate never favored anyone for long. Lady luck was known for her short memory, blessing someone with good fortune until she grew tired and skipped off to her next target. Jayden felt as if she\'d never even stopped his way nor did she have any intentions to pay him a visit. Misfortune seemed to follow him throughout his daily life, from since he was younger getting into brawls with other kids and unable to tolerate them to his pathetic life as an average shop clerk, dealing with irate customers, petty co-workers, and unkempt managers. Jayden was tired, so damn tired. And eventually, that tired feeling became too much to bear.\nIt was a rainy afternoon just after four pm, and he was headed into work for the late shift. He didn\'t mind working the evening shifts. After rush hour, things weren\'t so bad and if he was lucky, he\'d get thrown into stocking inventory, meaning fewer interactions with annoying people. But his brain was so fuzzy that day, gray as the scenery around him. Everything melted together in a bleak blend of shapes, colors, and wobbling motions. He stepped onto the train station platform, stopping just behind the yellow line that cautioned people from going any further less they suffer injury. There was hardly anyone who ever really paid attention to that rule, though. Jayden stuffed his hands into his coat pockets, a dead look in his eyes as he stared down at the train tracks. He pursed his lips and inhaled sharply.\n""Hey!"" A sudden voice broke his stupor and two muscular arms clad in a black blazer suddenly wrapped around his. ""Jeez, why did you tell me you were taking the train too?""\nJayden looked up at the person talking to him. It was a man, a beautiful one at that. He was a good few inches taller than Jayden with loose, curly reddish-black hair and soft hazel eyes. There was a pleasant aroma wafting from his pressed clothes, his smile was warm and bright, and crazily enough, it made Jayden\'s grayness shift back a bit.\n""S-Sorry?"" Jayden responded, still bewildered as to why he was conversing with the other. \n""Don\'t be sorry, just let me know next time, babe! We could\'ve left home together!""\nJayden felt his face get hot when the other called him \'babe\' and his heart started to skip a beat when the man leaned his face in close. ""Sorry about this. Can you play along, please? I\'m trying to shake somebody.""\nJayden didn\'t really know how to respond so he nodded instead. The ravenette\'s smiled broadened. There they stood, two strangers arm in arm as the train slowly pulled into the station. They got together and stood near the doors as the car loaded with people. The man glanced around at his surroundings then gave a small sigh of relief, although he didn\'t step away from Jayden.\n""Thanks again for helping me,"" he said. ""Sorry for roping you into an old man\'s business.""\n""No, it\'s fine,"" Jayden assured him. ""And you\'re very attractive for your age.""\nHe almost slapped himself in the face for saying that aloud, but the man just laughed at his words. ""You think so? Ah, I\'m gonna blush now.""\n""Anyway, if someone\'s following you, shouldn\'t you inform the police?"" Jayden questioned, genuinely concerned. \n""I suppose so, but I\'d rather not make a hassle out of small problems like this,"" the man told him with a sigh.\nBeing stalked is a small problem?  Jayden wondered. \nJayden\'s stop wasn\'t far, only a few stations away, and when it came time for him to get off, he felt a sharp twinge of disappointment that he had to leave the other\'s side. But the dark-haired man merely smiled at him, bent down, and lightly kissed his cheek, waving to him with a cheerful expression. \n""See you later!""\nLater... A heavy feeling set on Jayden\'s shoulders as he trudged to work. Later would never come, he didn\'t even get the man\'s name. His depressed energy lingered with him throughout his entire shift, kicking and berating himself for being such a doormat. He couldn\'t even enjoy the solitude of the slow workday. But then, something happened. \nWith less than an hour to go before his shift ended, Jayden was crouched behind the counter, cleaning up some cleaning fluid he\'d spilled while wiping down the register area. He heard footsteps approach and set aside the towels before standing upright. At that moment, he froze. On the other side of the counter stood none other than the dark-haired beauty from before. Their eyes met and the realization hit the other almost immediately. He broke out into a bright smile that had Jayden\'s heart doing somersaults.\n""Well, well, if it isn\'t my train station lifesaver! Funny running into you here,"" he said with a laugh. ""Who would\'ve guessed we worked near each other.""\n""Ah, r-really?"" Jayden managed to say, his hands shakily ringing up the other\'s items.\n""Mhm. I\'m employed at a pretty substandard company not far from here. I actually just came off shift.""\nJayden glanced down at the items being purchased: it was mostly instant make food. He frowned a bit, pausing just for a moment. \n""Do you...eat this often?"" he asked, keeping the tremor out of his voice.\n""Sometimes. I can\'t cook to save my life, and I\'m usually being treated for meals by my clients.""\nJayden swallowed. ""I can cook.""\nThere was silence, and Jayden felt like his head was about to explode because of it. He glanced up at the other man to find him still smiling. He cleared his throat, much louder than he wanted to. \n""It\'s fine if you don\'t want to,"" he quickly followed up. ""It was just an offer.""\n""...Can you make fried chicken?""\nJayden blinked then nodded. ""Oh, that\'s not a problem. But I don\'t get off for another forty-five minutes.""\n""That\'s okay, I can wait."" The man swiped his card as Jayden bagged up his items. ""I\'m Kendell, by the way. Kendell Maddison.""\n""Jayden...Jayden Garfield.""\n""I\'ll wait for you out front, then.""\n""A-Alright.""\nAs Kendell turned to leave, he stopped and looked back at Jayden. ""It was a lie, by the way.""\n""H-Huh?""\n""That I was being followed."" \n""What?!"" \n""You looked ready to jump."" Jayden went stiff. Kendell\'s expression shifted a bit. ""I\'ve come in here before while you were working. I don\'t think you ever noticed me, but I always noticed you. That may sound creepy coming from someone my age, but I couldn\'t help it. I wanted to talk to you so badly...""\nKendell sighed. ""God, I\'m rambling.""\n""Kendell."" For the first time in a long time, Jayden let a smile fall across his face. ""Thank you.""\nMaybe my luck isn\'t so bad after all.', '""A Lucky Encounter"".\n""Sorry, sir, you dropped that"". said a boy to a drunk old unknown man, who promptly threw such object away, crashing more than it had broken the first time he dropped it. It may not have been intentional, but ... who would care? That bottle was really going to be hidden under the snow, and his old man\'s  nose was red in contrast to the blue cold, he didn\'t even care about the drops of liquid that once warmed his throat.\nOnly one person cared about it, but no one else cared about him. Even with his hand slightly injured with a dash of glass, he scraped it against his previously ripped coat from a previous fight. Boys don\'t cry, he thought. Or he tried to think, since the streets whistled a cold, deadly wind that would freeze even the most intelligent neurons. That kid was in trouble.\nShould I go home?, he thought. My dad would probably beat me up for running away. It was because of a bottle ... yes, it was because of a bottle. A few inches from his head, missing a few hair strands and still smelling a little beer (now in tiny snowflakes), that boy walked the streets with no reason to live. Why come home? They must be feeling a lot better without me. That bottle ...\nHe looked down at his shoes that were put on quickly, as if he were a marathon runner chasing his prize ... freedom from suffering and humiliation. They were not tied; they trailed across the snow, as if it were a clue to Death\'s enconter. Maybe I\'m not wanted anymore, he thought. Maybe I\'m a mistake in his plans. Mom would look a lot prettier if I hadn\'t been sprouted during a Christmas party. What an ungrateful gift my father received, a bastard who forced him to look for a job and support me. One more mouth to feed, in this world of misery where the rich always get richer, and the poor are always forced to work to maintain the system. Ah, that bottle ...\nYour head still hurts. But how did it hurt, if the bottle hadn\'t even hit me? ."".. unless ..."", his thought flies farther than a dry leaf that managed to escape the hands of Autumn. Unless the bottle really hit me ... ""take that away!!"", those words start to echo in your mind. A female cry. A smell of sweat and beer in the air. Now he remembers. ""No, there\'s no way back"", he concludes. He still doesn\'t know the reason nor he cares anymore. But where to go? His youthful mentality did not give him full capacity for critical thinking, he decides to go beyond his miserable life. ""There\'s a pond next to me"", he thinks, ""no one will miss me anyway"".\nWalking near the almost frozen pond, he knows what to do, but can\'t remember exactly why he was doing it. Memories are sparse, and although he still remembers the door slamming behind him, and voices shouting for him to return... a slap sound echoed. A female cry. A smell of sweat and beer in the air. ""That bastard!"", he shouted for nobody; his scream was muffled by the harsh winds. But one extra voice echoed along with him. Sounds like a cry. A cry from someone whose tail was stuck in a wooden fence door that was abruptly closed by the same wind that blocked his vent. Perhaps the sound that came to his head, re",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urning his memory to that fateful moment, was from such a door being slammed.\nA poor puppy, with a fate not as lucky as his, struggled to free itself from its momentary suffering. Sharp howls that could cause despair to anyone. What a bad person, Fate, to allow such suffering to happen! With a quick movement, and extra care not to be bitten by an enraged animal,,,, says the boy, running his hand slowly over his head to remove the little snow that had accumulated. Exhausted from his struggle, the poor dog finally surrenders and lies down," breathing deeply.\n""""I also have a pain""""", said the boy, petting the dog\'s head.The puppy looks up to him, and as a gesture of thanks," gives his hand a small lick.""""I know a good vet that could help you""""", he said. And, with extra strength, he was able to hold up that little puppy in his arms and walk. It\'s no longer snowing, and the wind was now calm and silent," as if someone found an inner peace.\n""""Ding", ding," ding""""", said the bell at the door. The first to see him was the receptionist, who as soon as he saw him, ran towards him," as if he thanked God that his prayers had been answered.""""You could take a look at~"""""," his speech was cut off by the receptionist\'s worried look.""""Where have you been? Your dad was totally worried!! He even called the police after you!""""""""... what?"""" he murmured. """"My father ... that bastard!""""""""Bastard? What are you talking about?"""""," she said. """"He was worried about you! How come you run away after slipping and hitting the table? I\'ll call your father you\'re here"," while that... can somebody please perform vet care""""\n""""Table?""""", even the dog looked up to know for an answer," as saying """"I\'ll stay here with you"""".No vet was able to take the dog away from his arms; he growled for everybody trying to do the same. In his mind"," maybe some monologue was running along with """"I won\'t let you alone", buddy, you were the only one that cared about me, and I\'ll stay with you," always!""""\nAnd then", while his dog is taken away," distracted with all those toys the receptionist brought to him....... toys........ his memory came back.\n""""Dinner is served!""""", said Mom, with a sweet voice. You could imagine her soft voice of butter commercials. Her father, on the other side," had just come home after a horrible day at work; his hands holds a bottle of beer.""""You can\'t imagine", he began his monologue," """"today my boss made me sign huge paperwork"," and ... AACK!!!""""", He steps on a cart that was on the floor," and almost flies near the television that was three meters away. """"Damn those scattered toys ...""""\nGoing down the stairs", two kids comes down stairs, Johnny, with 4yo, and Ethan," 12yo.""""What did I said about toys on the floor?"""""," The father goes directly to the 4yo."""".. never let them... on the floor"""""," the kid looks down.""""So"," take that away""""", he commands; the kid makes a boo-boo face," but starts collecting your toys. """"So", Ethan," how\'s school today?""""Ethan looks a bit annoyed. His coat has a rip near the shoulder.""""Nothing""""", he said, more in silence. In fact, he had another fight at school, but he didn\'t want to talk about. It\'s like he\'s trying to be strong for himself, keeping everything inside him," like a soda pop ready to burst.""""What\'s this rip in your new coat?"""""," the father asked. """"You love this coat~""""""""I said it\'s nothing", dad... I just fell," that\'s it"""""," he tries to divert the subject again.""""Ethan! Is there anything wrong?""""", ask the father worried," while putting the beer on the table.""""NO"," nothing wrong!!""""", he shouted. His mind was completely defused by the school stress, as he walks to the dinner table.\nBut sadly, Johnny didn\'t had time to clear the entire floor. One toy was missing.Ethan step on it, and his head hit really hard in the table," pouring part of the beer that was still on the bottle.""""Ethan!! Ethan!!""""", his mom shouted, while he was on the floor," now with a broken bottle alongside it. She raises his head trying to get any response: none is given. """"Call the doctor!""""", she shouted to his father, who tried to look at next hospital\'s number on his iPhone. Johnny didn\'t noticed what was happening," and proceeded to his task.\n""""F*******!""""", was the first thing Ethan said. His entire mind was previously scrambled by the hit; the first thing he did was to put the shoes he always left at the door when returning from school and left home. That scene was so quick that none was able to react properly to it, and when his mom was able to grasp the situation, it was already late: Ethan was running away faster, not listening to his mom\'s shouts, and tears rolling from his eyes.\nNot just because of the pain in the head.But because he couldn\'t grasp how wonderful his life was, living in a safe place, with a mom and a dad taking care of him... but sadly he never learned how life can throw you at the floor and hit you, like how some kids were doing that to him. Not every kid trust his parents to tell \'em the truth; maybe because of the fear of getting repressed, or because they\'re told to always seek perfection," """"never take no as answer""""", compete to win only," """"I only accept A+ in math!"""""," but there\'s no love when someone takes a """"D"""". Everybody is special", so we deserve the best, and when we face reality, we sadly discover that life isn\'t fun and party, and that the only ones that can protect us (our fathers," our relatives) are still struggling themselves.\nBecause we are humans. We aren\'t loyal to each other... like dogs do.\n""""Hey Ethan""""", the vet come along the dog, now with a band on his tail," which wags like crazy. """"your dog has no fractures"," it\'s just a little sore"""". Once the dog is put on the floor"," he runs to Ethan and licks him constantly.""""Thanks for saving my life"""""," the dog could say.""""Thanks for saving mine""""", Ethan could reply, but not before a sweet, but relieved, voice echoed on the air," claiming his name.""""Oh thank God you\'re okay""""", said his mom," crying like a baby. """"Thanks"," Edna for calling us! Thank you! Are you okay? How\'s your head?""""""""Son!!""""", his father comes in with Johnny on his arms," and gives both a hug. """"I\'m so sorry to talk like that to you! Please forgive me"," forgive me...""""\n""""No"," dad. Forgive me"""""," his hug seemed to embrace everyone who was present on this day. He also cries like a baby. """"I promise I\'ll always trust in you", always! I\'m so sorry," so.... """""," he sobs without finishing his sentence.""""Excuse me"""""," Edna asks. """"What\'s your dog\'s name?""""""""Dog?"""""," the father replies. """"We don\'t have a dog.""""""""Now we do""""", Ethan replies, which makes Johnny smile from ear to ear.\n\nI hope you all like it. And forgive my english errors.

But, when he opened the fridge, the gallon of milk was empty. Why couldn’t his room mate just leave the empty gallon out? With a sigh, the brunette rinsed out the container and set it aside for recycling. They were also out of bread and cheese, so a sandwich was also out of reach. \nResigned to his fate, Markus made and drank a cup of black coffee as his breakfast. He checked the weather on his phone and chose a jacket to accommodate it. But, the zipper slider broke off and he couldn’t close it. \n“Great,” he huffed. \nHowever, his misfortune did not end there. On his morning walk, he moved out of the way of a stray cycler and ended up stepping on a fresh piece of gum. As he sat down on a park bench, a lizard fell on top of his head, startling him to near death. \n“Just what is it with today?” \nWhen he was halfway into the nature trail, a smooth leaf attached to the sticky residue on the bottom of his shoe and he ended up slipping against a pile of leaves and falling forward. Discouraged with his many mishaps, he dropped all the way to the ground and laid his head on folded arms. That’s when he saw it.\nLonely and distant from its three-leaf variant, stood a four-leaf clover a few inches away from his face. For the first time that day, a smile formed on his face. Markus didn’t hesitate to grab it. \n“Are you OK?” \nThe young man glanced a the direction of the voice and saw the familiar face of one of his class-mates. She was a dark-skinned beauty who sat a row or two behind him. He couldn’t help the goofy grin that formed on his face as she helped him up from the ground.

Though being professional and all, she’ll try to keep it discreet. Now, just because she is so serious, don’t think she doesn't know how to be fierce. Erin Jiang is someone who lives for herself, at her own pace, with her own rules, and she sure as hell makes everyone else follow through. Erin Jiang is someone who will look out for herself. Mockery and judgment you say? Let them be the sparks to her flames.\nNow that everything has been said and done, let us just keep in mind. There is no one quite like Erin Jiang. Someone who will shave off their hair, feel utterly distressed by it, and my God, still end up using it to strike a business deal."", ""Oh this one's a hard one because there's a lot of brave and strong female leads that I like for different reasons. For example, I really like Melissa from Beware the Villainess.\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nBeware the Villainess! | Tapas\nSit back and take in this romantic tale of an angelic heroine and her devoted suitors as they vie for the depths of her love... or not. This story’s about to go through some edits!

She learns how to wield a sword to protect herself and others she hold dear. She also a very 'tell it as it is' person so she calls out people's rudeness and makes them reflect on their actions. But on the other hand I also really admire Penelope from Villains are Destined to Die a lot.\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nVillains Are Destined to Die | Tapas\nThis game’s got me obsessed! It’s like it’s taken over my life... wait—HARD MODE ACTIVATED. No-no-no-no-no! It has literally taken me and thrown me into the part of Penelope Eckhart. Love is easy as the heroine, but as the hated villainess, I’m...\n\n\n\n\n\n She has to live in a world were everyone practically hates her and with every interaction she has with these people she faces uncertain death. She is a very brave person for not just being like 'okay I'm probably going to die if a stay here... So peace out.'Instead she stays and faces all challenges head on and takes some pretty risky moves (especially during the end of season 1 like omg). Let's not forget her backstory she's been through sooo much and just when she thinks her life is going good the universe said 'haha you thought' and chucks her in a dangerous position. I just really admire her perseverance and how smart she is for using her knowledge of the world to her advantage. There's so many more women that I really like but these are my main two."", ""Princess Sapphia from High Class Homos. She inspires me because as a girl sometimes I feel pressured to act proper and lady like and have to follow all the rules that a boy wouldn't have to.

She's responsible for her duty and resilient, she's also supporting her husband without expecting anything in return. I wish I can be like her"", 'Lady Yvona from The Soulless Duchess she is the most inspirational lady for me. With all the hardships and mistreatment and abuse she went through she still fought back when she got a second chance. She fought back at her dad, her ex-fiancé, and her cousin.

She even created a marriage with the Duke of Azentine, I will always enjoy reading this story, so as long as I have ink and the author continues to write I will never stop reading.

47,Autism Acceptance 2021,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello! 
So I'm starting this a bit later than I meant to, but the last few years we have been doing Autism Acceptance/awarness collection. Were we put together a collection of stories that from from the rustic community to share their experiences, view points, and such during the month of April. We hope to post at least one story, comic, or art piece a day in April. 
Whoever chooses to enter their piece, we ask that it be from someone within the community. We will give full credit as desired by each person.


tapas.io7



Autism Acceptance 2019 Collection  | Tapas
This is a collection of stories told from the perspectives of those with autism, or who have loved ones with autism. We hope you will better understand and accept those that have autism. This is for Autism Acceptance day of 2019.







tapas.io8



Autism Acceptance 2020 | Tapas
A collection of views from the autistic and their loved ones for 2020 in honor of Autism Awareness Day.





If you would like to take part please let me know below or DM me directly. Stories, comics, and art are all allowed. We would like items to be added no later than April 2nd if possible, by April 24th at the latest so I have some time to format everything.
Please feel free to share this information with others that may be interested.
Thank you!","['I have been thinking about writing a Tapas novel that stars an autistic main character. It will also be a BL story. I am autistic myself. So my question is are novels included as well (like maybe just the first chapter or two)? Or only short stories? \nI love that this event exists! Thanks for hosting it. <3', 'been looking to approach this topic. how about collaborating? How do you want to approach it?', ""As an autistic creator who just had a major autistic character turn up in my comic, this sounds interesting! It'd be nice to do a little spinoff omake about Jules' autism, since right now they're a little busy with giant demonic arms attacking them in the actual comic. \nAlso paging my partner, @mx_Jinn because Julia in Bard Romance is autistic with struggles and quirks partially based on my own."", ""I'm autistic and my novel is full of autistic-coded characters as a result, though it's only got what I have posted here so far so IDK if it would qualify "", ""As someone with Asperger's, I'd like to participate (it'd also be a sneaky way for me to promote a comic I'm currently writing). I'd like to write about my own experiences with it (spoiler alert: it's not fun)."", ""\n\nMandy_was_here:\nSo my question is are novels included as well (like maybe just the first chapter or two)? Or only short stories?\n\n\nTuffKuki:\nbeen looking to approach this topic. how about collaborating? How do you want to approach it?\nHi! Let me please clarify. If YOU are autistic (official or self diagnosing) then this is the thing for you. It is not to promote your own novels, but your personal story and things you wish people knew or understood. what you feel comfortable sharing about your experience.\nEach update will be one persons expression about their personal experience on the topic. Please check out the past years linked above to get an idea of what we are doing.\n\n\ndarthmongoose:\nAs an autistic creator who just had a major autistic character turn up in my comic, this sounds interesting! It'd be nice to do a little spinoff omake about Jules' autism,\nThis sounds pretty neat. I'm guessing you'll be sharing what it can be like through the character? please keep in mind it'll be one update only.\n\n\nKirvee:\nthough it's only got what I have posted here so far so IDK if it would qualify\nThis is a short one piece item. Just to share your experiences in a way you feel comfortable. I will be looking to see if my son wishes to share anything at this time, as well as sharing a bit of my journey of self diagnosing.\n\n\nMovieNut14:\nI'd like to write about my own experiences with it (spoiler alert: it's not fun).\nAnd that's ok. We aren't expecting everyone to post only positive things. All we ask is it be true to yourself and your feelings on the matter."", ""Hm....I may still be interested then! A lot of the story and conflict that I plan to have in Demon Story is related to how I used to see my own autism before I was properly diagnosed (which didn't happen until I was 16). So if you're wanting a one-time piece I could probably write a little essay about it."", ""Mmm. I'm not really into performing trauma for this type of thing. There's enough of that stuff out there I think, and I'd just be adding to the masses of autistic pain that neurotypicals salivate over. Why not promote creations by autistic creators? Why do we have to tell our private stories to get promoted?"", ""I'm not against people sharing their personal stories if they want to, but what if their project is part of the story they want to tell?"", 'I don\'t really see it as ""performing trauma"", though I understand your worry. I don\'t think this would be contributing to inspiration porn or anything like that. Not everyone has a positive experience with their autism.', ""Thank you for clarifying. When it comes to writing a story about our personal experience is there a word limit?I wouldn't mind writing my personal story but it is pretty depressing."", ""\n\nCytricAcid:\nWhy not promote creations by autistic creators? Why do we have to tell our private stories to get promoted?\nThe idea behind it is to share what you wish others knew/understood. it can even be something as simple as organizations that in your experience organizations that you feel do good for the community. We started this to try and give a voice to Those in the community to say what they would like, and the ability to remain anonymous while they do so if they wish. Some share positive stories, some share insights, some choose to share their sorrows. And if someone changes their mind later (as was the case last year) we remove the story at their request.\nSo one example was one year my son (diagnosed) wanted us to share a letter that explained what autism was like for him and explain some of his behaviors as part of the project. The year after, realizing I may be autistic myself, my son and I chose to share a story of someone's ignorance that I had to deal with. It can be overarching or just a small moment. It's what you feel comfortable sharing (if anything at all).\nI only offer to share the links in case someone wants to. However if you want to make a collection where you find autistic creators and share their works I think that's a fantastic idea. It's jsut not the project being done here.\n\n\nKimBryanArt:\nI'm not against people sharing their personal stories if they want to, but what if their project is part of the story they want to tell?\nI think it'd be fine if you want to talk about it and what it means to you in your experience. I assume that's what you mean?\n\n\nKirvee:\nI don't think this would be contributing to inspiration porn or anything like that. Not everyone has a positive experience with their autism.\nRight it really isn't meant to be that at all. It's just a way to give people in the community a voice during the time frame that folks pay attention.\n\n\nMandy_was_here:\nWhen it comes to writing a story about our personal experience is there a word limit?\nIt's say keep it the length tapas would normally allow. That way it keeps to a good length. Remember that you can write about any aspect of your experience. My son is thinking about talking about how he's been finding tools that work for him, but he isn't sure yet."", ""Just a bump to remind everyone if I can have any entries you want to do ASAP, that'd be great. Thanks!"", 'Where do we send them to?', 'You can DM the file to me or send it t my email hueareyoucomic@gmail.com']",2/27/2021 22:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contest-6.jpg1024x1024 584 KB

What do I have to do? - Make a piece of art using characters from Tall Poppy Syndrome. Only one Entry per person, por favor.
When/where do I submit? - All submissions are due by March 15th. Don't sweat it. You've got plenty of time. You can send your submission to me in a private message or post it to this thread.
How will I know if I've won? - I'll post the winners on my homepage and to this thread. Remember, the winners will just reflect my brother and I's personal taste.
How do I get my moneys? - I buy the Amazon gift cards, scratch the silver stuff off the back, and send the winners the codes in a private message. This seems a lot simpler than mailing stuff. Don't be afraid to contact me if I mess up somehow and type the gift card code wrong.
Do I have to be subscribed to Tall Poppy Syndrome to enter? - No, but I sure would appreciate it. Subscribers give me self esteem units.
Aren't you afraid this looks too desperate? - Yes. Yes I am.
Does Tapas allow this sort of thing? - As far as I can tell, and I read all the terms and conditions. For paranoia reasons.
Thanks for reading and (hopefully) participating. Keep it frosty, Internet people!

58,2020 Autism Acceptance Collection (Please join!),Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone!
You may recall last year we did a Autism Acceptance collection with others for 2019.

tapas.io25



Autism Acceptance 2019 Collection  | Tapas
This is a collection of stories told from the perspectives of those with autism, or who have loved ones with autism. We hope you will better understand and accept those that have autism. This is for Autism Acceptance day of 2019.






Once again, I am looking for folks to submit works to enter and show your viewpoint on what it is like/what you wish people knew about autism. A few things to note.

It can be written, comic, or even a single image
It should be freshly created for this collection
I would really like to stick as much as possible with people who are autistic to give a voice
You can be anonymous if you like. We know not everyone feels comfortable putting that part of themselves front and center.
Please let me know below if you want to do this, so I can contact you.
We are hoping this year for one each day for the month of April. I would like your work by March 28.

We will be consulting with our son, who is diagnosed, about anything he'd like to add. Also, any Ink given to us that month will go to an organization that helps those with autism (Not Autism Speaks, we have issues with them). We are currently researching which one to go with.
I do ask if you don't agree with this, that's cool but don't get on those that want to do this here please.
Thank you!","[""I have a brother who's autistic, and love him absolutely to bits! He's the smartest, funniest person I know. Good luck!

60,Contest Listing Thread,Events | Challenges,[],"Yo! It's my first topic of 2021, WOO!
One of the toughest things about being an indie creator is self promotion. Particularly finding places to promote your hard work. 
This year I'm going to be entering a lot of art contests as a way of getting my art in front of people, and I thought, maybe it would be cool to share what contests I enter with the Tapas community. If anyone is interested, they can join up too.
I think contests are a great way to get your work seen, and also challenge yourself. It could be daunting, especially if you feel like you might not be 'good enough' but the way I see it, is that it's a learning experience either way. And who knows...there's always the chance that you might win. Also there's the added bonus of networking with other artists who post in the challenges, and seeing some cool art along the way.
Anyways, to the meat of the topic. If you know of contests, whereever they are hosted, whether on social media, or art sites, please feel free to drop the links here in this thread. 
So starting out this thread with a link I found this OC Creation Challenge on Medibang/Art Street. Pretty sweet deal, you can even use existing OCs you have if you want.

BEST CHARACTER WRITING

73,How will you handle time travel?,Events | Challenges,[],"So, many of you know time travel, we are all aware of how movies, comics, novels, or any other content used it. We see it in Terminator, and back to the future, etc. However, do you find it odd that some of these contents don't meet up to your expectations of how time travel should be handled?
I really don't like stories where they use it, and afterward has no drawbacks or an effect where it might backfire where it overcomplicates certain events.
So here is this, How will you use time travel that looks very understandable, simple, and feels accurate?
For me, When a hero uses time travel to save the future, he/she did not actually change the future for the better, it actually created another dimension, another galaxy whose future differs from its counterpart and the dark part is, the hero did not know this, leaving behind everything they care and love from their original galaxy to their own fate. 
Dark and thrilling I know,  but seems to be simple and straightforward. 
So this is what I think a lore of the entire universe could be interesting, where there is supposed to be only one galaxy as a universe until an advanced species which could include humans created time-traveling machines and rarely, sometimes, or more often either change the past or the future only to just continuously create duplicates of galaxies, each have different outcomes, and humans and other species could potentially look very different from the first galaxy.
So what about your idea of time traveling? How will you use it for your own content?","[""For me, I would never incorporate time travel into my story. The closest thing to time travel in my story is future vision and time stopping. (Even though I do have a few characters that could time travel.) I feel like it's just unnecessary baggage. BUT if I did do time travel, my characters will only travel to the future and never the past. So unless your story is based around it, I recommend not doing it. Unless you're just very knowledgeable on the subject matter."", 'Well, I will never use it on my comic at all, but maybe on its lore, for the origins of countless galaxies, maybe.', 'I wanna show different types of it and how they affect reality/personal realities. I have an OC who is, will show up in a W.I.P series, the Watcher of Time and can directly affect it without causing any issues; I will show the different types through him as he has comments about mortals affecting time crudely and made analogies referencing how bad it can get and how it can never go back to the way it was even if fixed back entirely after being damaged from crude use.', ""That's actually interesting, a character who has complete control on fixing time comparing to those who are inferior for changing time, let alone controlling it."", 'Yeah and thanks ^__^.', ""I do have an idea for a somewhat time traveling story. It's about a guy who can see into the past but he has to be in a designated location to do it. He also can see into the future but only by 5 seconds. His limitation is that he can't see what is happening in modern times while he is doing it. I was thinking of maybe doing a detective story with him."", 'How will I handle time travel? I don\'t have any plans on writing anything involving time travel right now. Unless... you know something about my future...?\n\nJokes aside, I find the prospect of writing a time travel story to be intimidating because I know everyone\'s just going to pick apart the mechanics of how it works and it\'s never going to be concrete enough to satisfy those types of people. I literally know of only one time travel story that makes them happy and that\'s Primer, which I\'ve never seen but only know because those types of people always say it\'s the only story where time travel makes sense.\nPersonally, as an audience member, I\'m far more laissez-faire with how stories handle time travel than most nerds. I see the time travel first and foremost as a plot device for telling an interesting story, not as the author\'s dissertation on how time travel should actually operate. In fact, I\'m pretty sure the more a writer tries to make the time travel make sense, the more likely they are to invite nerds to tell them exactly why it doesn\'t work. Less is more, in my opinion.\nIf I ever do tackle time travel, I\'d probably just lean into the whole ""Look, this doesn\'t make sense, but just go along with it, OK?"" angle that the film Looper did. Bruce Willis plays future Joseph Gordon-Levitt and there\'s a scene where they\'re talking about how he traveled back in time and Willis basically says ""I can sit here and chart out the full mechanics of how this works, but we don\'t have time for that, I\'m here, let\'s move on"" and I respect that writing choice. And it would make no sense for Willis to provide a proper explanation, he\'s just some (relatively) low-level goon who uses time travel for his job - he has no idea how it works and doesn\'t need to for his job. It would be like expecting a modern commuting worker to be able to drop everything and exposit on how the metro works.\nThe way I see it, if a story\'s time travel doesn\'t seem to make sense, I just chalk it up to ""There are weird quirks of time travel in this universe that make some things seem to make no sense, but neither the audience nor the people in-universe know enough about it to explain why it works out that way, it just does.""', 'I like how they handled it in ‘Steins Gate’, where it’s not the physical person but their mind that gets transferred into the past, into their younger selfs.That’s, to me personally, the most rational way to approach time travel (at least into the past. Into the future it might be a bit trickier  )\nThat’s being said, I would approach time travel the same. I’d send the mind if my MC into the past and essentially have a younger self of them with an adult mind and knowledge of the future. I think that could be an intriguing story without getting too tangled up with the complex (and confusing) aspects of different time lines ', 'I think when it comes to the ""science"" of time travel (in regards to how paradoxes are handled, and things like that), it probably depends on the story. But I\'m kind of leaning towards having the nuts-and-bolts of the time travel take more of a backstage role\nFor my own stories, I\'m more interested in a kind of personal time travel: instead of having characters travel to another era, I find the idea of a character traveling to another point in their own lives. some examples would be the anime The Girl Who Leaped Through Time or the anime/manga Erased. So this could be many years into their past/future or mere days.It\'s worth mentioning that with this type of time travel, your current self is typically transported to your past body (if you\'re traveling to the past)\nThis approach, in my opinion, should really put unintended side effects of choices in the spotlight as things get messier and messier due to the choices.', ""Interesting suject.As for a lot of SF or SF related sujects, I'm both intrigued and put off by time travel stories.Intrigued because I find the technical difficulties, and consequences, extremely stimulating intellectually; put off because by definition there is no perfect way to explain how it would happen, and to predict what would result of it, and this may go from eye-rolling to slighlty frustrating, but never be fully satisfying.So, I would still prefer no explaination over bad explanations.However, the simplistic or comedic takes on time travel are not very attractive for me, so I need another way to avoid explanations.One way could be to focus on one specific aspect of the consequences of time travel, making time travel an already understood and mundane thing for the characters. This is not discussed anymore, only the specific consequence is.Or, a magic realism setting, where the unexplainable is either entirely embraced, or a different explanation is suggested, but not imposed,  where the time travelling did not occur after all.This being said I have crappy suspension of disbelief so it's a general issue for me, not just time travel."", ""You can actually make something more believable by having experts in your story go at length about how it's not possible. This was done in the movie Jurassic Park, and I'm pretty sure the technique carries over to time travel as well."", ""I have an entire personal thesis regarding time travel and it's potential in story writing. If you're interested I'll tell you more about it, but it is quite lengthy. I'll leave a summary below:\nTypes of Time Travel:\nTraditional - if we consider the mainstream time travel as seen in most movies or as defined by the Time Machine by HG Wells. PROs - allows experiencing different time periods (past and future). CONs - you will be burdened by explaining and resolving paradoxes (which honestly is not worth the trouble as the pay-off is most often meh).\nTime Control - moving time forward and backward in small increments as seen in the game Life is Strange and the Time Stone in Marvel Comics. This is a relatively simple method of time travel with minimal damage to time-space continuum. Technically, this happens all the time (especially in physics)\nTime leap- jumping forward in time. This is also a relatively simple way of time travel. It's basically the same as suspended animation, just more instantaneous. Since this does not mess with time-space consistency and merely a displacement, there won't be paradoxes.\nDimension hop - travel to the present time in an alternate timeline (think Rick and Morty and the infinite Ricks and Mortys)\nNow let us combine all of the above to make a more coherent scenario on how time travel can be possible without the drawbacks.\nI call this my Overly Complicated Derivatively Acceptable Time Travel Theory.\nFirst let us postulate that time travels in a straight line and assign this along the x-axis (x,0) let us call this the origin, now consider the chaos theory and assume that each possibility (each potential random result) generates it's own timeline that runs parallel the axis. Now consider their position away from the origin (x,y), the farther away they from the origin (positive or negative), the greater the difference/deviance from the original timeline. \nSecond, let us consider a wave passing through these lines originating from any point along (x,0) with an amplitude=infinity. This wave represents the start of consciousness and each time the wave intersects the origin this represents a turning point in history. The area between these points is what I consider the central finite curve (from Rick and Morty) where all possible decisions will result in the same major turning point. i.e. if Germany didn't start WWII, someone else would have.\nThird, consider time travel as a function of arctan originating from one timeline and terminates parallel to another.\nIf we consider these three assumptions, preservation of matter, and interdimensional displacement, there would be a few ways to accomplish time travel back to the past. In a perspective of one character, we can consider the transfer of consciousness. This means, you transfer your current consciousness to your past self arming yourself with knowledge of the future. An interesting point to this is that the possibility already exists with or without you travelling back in time.\nTravelling to the past where you entirely do not exist is a different matter. In my theory, this would require a great amount of energy and expectedly a machine from which to draw and convert this energy. This is a must keep readers engaged, otherwise your character would just plainly be OP if they can travel forward and back by themselves with no repercussions. Individuals with this kind of ability are usually restrained by rules and are not usually meant to be the driving force in a story\nTL;DR if you will consider to have time travel as a driving force in your story, make it coherent and plausible via a gimmick. A good example can be seen in Umbrella Academy, Number 5 can time travel but the way to do it is complicated, they have a gimmick where a secret organization uses special briefcases that allow time travel into the past. In your idea, where the hero is leaving behind his original galaxy/dimension is all well and good. It is justifiable in a proper space-time continuum sense. Creating duplicate galaxies however, is kind of a stretch. I mean, could you imagine how much energy would be required to do such a thing? Also, there is an issue with duplicating galaxies as they are visible via telescope and discovering that their is a galaxy identical to theirs (although is a good plot point) may be hard to explain."", ""Well it really depends on the story and how the characters travel in time. That would usually affect the rules also. Multiversal time travel is different from time machine time travel and so on. But if I was going to make something now I'd probably say that time is only really a construct of the mind made to organize the overload of information that we observe in the universe. So travelling in time is more along the lines of altering your mind's perspective. That's if you want to travel in your lifetime. To go into deeper history you'd have to access genetic memory in the DNA. Something more akin to Assassin's Creed. You aren't realy back in time but running a simulation of recorded history where variables may be allowed but nothing too massive. Traveling to the far future might involve universal consciousness and accessing the perspective of that to take you where you want. That would actually work both ways and would allow you the freedom to change things too. However the base idea for this is that everything has already happened in one moment and our brains are just sorting out all the information along a timescale. So you wouldn't be able to make any serious changes really. \nI guess you could say my time travel is very scientific - philosophy based rather than ooh look magic device!"", ""An excellent question! \nIn my universe of comics, time travel is used as a means to travel to alternate dimensions of the prime world. There are a lot of intelligent people in my universe of comics who know how to effectively navigate through dimensional hotspots, and there are a LOT of alternate universal hotspots.\nTime travel stories are quite interesting. As long as someone knows why they want to tell such a story, and not use it as a deus ex machina. Like when it comes to consequences like the death of a character and resurrecting them, saying that it was in an alternate universe due to time travel only cheapens the plot. point\nI don't really know where I was going with that last thought but yeah ."", ""Some thoughts on the multiple-universe method of time travel, in which an alternate universe is created whenever somebody travels back in time (these are my own opinions and aren't meant to condemn other people's stories):\nThis method seems to be the default approach right now. It solves the Grandfather Paradox (when the changes you make eliminates the possibility/need of you going back in time in the first place), so why reinvent the wheel, right?Well... It's not quite that simple. I personally hate this approach and here's why: \nIf you travel back into time to fix a problem, than did you really fix it or help anybody but yourself? If all you did was create an alternate universe, than the only person that benefits is yourself. Sure the people in this new alternate universe have might benefit, but they wouldn't exist if you didn't go back in time, and the original versions of themselves still have the same problems as well as your disappearance. \nThis doesn't completely ruin the story for me, unless the alternate universe idea is pushed to far. An episode of Stargate SG1 comes to mind, which roughly goes like this: There's a device that alerts the presence of earth in other universes to an alien menace, and the main cast had to prevent/undo it. I mean, what's the point? if there exists a universe for each possibility, than even if you save those universes, there's still the other version of those universes that don't get saved.\nIt just makes the whole thing so futile, as well as devaluing individuals (because there's an infinite amount of the same person). I know some people would say that the alternate universe idea is scientific, but it's not. As far as I know, it's just a hypothesis with no evidence--and with no way it can be proved.\nSometimes I can  suspend my disbelief or even enjoy alternate universe stories, but I don't think I will ever use it in my own work."", 'I actually just wrote up an entire thing about how time travel is going to work in a future story I plan to write, so here goes:\nThe thing I hate most about time travel in other media is when changing something in the past destroys the timeline that the time traveler originally came from. Like, if someone time travels in that scenario, it\'s probably because things are so bad that the character\'s loved ones are probably dead/going to die soon anyway, and if not, then that\'s just being depressing for no reason. But if it\'s brought up that the original timeline is destroyed, then it\'s usually just so the time traveler can be angsty.\nIt\'s worth mentioning that I\'m writing a comedy, not a drama.\nIn my story, the way time works is that every choice made, no matter how trivial, creates a branching timeline. There\'s no such thing as a ""main"" or ""alpha"" timeline, because there\'s no such thing as a wrong choice in the grand scheme of time. Alternate timelines never disappear, they just exist forever alongside every other timeline.\nTime travel isn\'t technically scientifically possible. There are people who can see into the future, but there are limitations, such as if they don\'t look for a specific outcome, they only see the events that are most likely to happen, so they can\'t see things that are completely random, like the winning lottery numbers, things that are too far in the future and therefore have too many variables, or things that are technically scientifically impossible.\nTime travel can be done, but it requires magic. There\'s a specific spell that works in a specific way that is used in the story. The person who casts the spell can only swap someone from their current point in time with themselves from ten years in the future. Which branch of the timeline they\'re brought from is chosen by ~magic~ so it\'s not going to be something inconvenient like the future!character was about to get squashed by a meteor so now present!character is dead in the future. To send them back to their own time, just cast the spell on them again to swap them back.\nSimple, convenient, and relatively drama-free! Why does the future!character help their present!friends when they\'re not getting anything out of it? Uh, because they\'re not a dick? What happens to present!character in the future? They get to hang out with their future!friends and see all their cool future!stuff! What effect does this have on the timelines? It creates a new one, which is just a drop in the ocean really. Infinite alternate timelines, baby, what\'s one more?\nThis all makes it sound like time travel is really prevalent in the story when it only comes up like twice. ', 'My story is actually based around (a type) time travel! (although maybe not quite the type you\'re referring to)  What i ended up doing to avoid the hard to understand and read details that ""We have to go to the past and kill your grandpa!"" type stories use, I ended up going for a more groundhogs-day type time travel, where the characters are forced to relive the same month over and over again. They can\'t change the past, because once the month ends, they are transported back to the beginning and nothing they did in the previous month exists anymore. \nSo instead of the characters creating a new timeline and accidentally preventing their own birth, they are bing forced into new timelines again and again and have to figure out how to stay in one for more than a month.', 'Mine is a soft science approach. I have even included in the script some dialogue where it calls itself out on it, that really no one knows how the time travel works. \nThe time travel device simply appeared, some people were expecting it but by far most were not. Even those who were expecting it had the exact details of what to expect diluted by centuries of infighting in their own group. The group is made up of descendants of people who got stuck hundreds, even thousands of years in the past.\nSome people appear with the time machine, most are groups of unfortunate people plucked from their own place in time, others personally knew the ancestors of the descendants but were not involved in time travel in a scientific way.\nBecause the ancestors were, for their own reasons, studying various influential people from the past the people pulled from their proper time were people who had shaped the timeline into what it is today.\nIt’s a story that explores people acquiring an incredibly powerful piece of technology that they don’t understand but believe they can gain from.\nThe general mechanics of the time travel is that when you change the past you change the future.Therefore the world of the present, which is pretty much the real world as the reader knows it, only exists as it does because these particular historical time travellers never got a chance to make their mark.\nI hope to set the tone of the story so it doesn’t ever seem too sci-fi, more speculative, more drama, more fantasy. My biggest worry of the whole thing is that people will get into it expecting big scientific answers and be disappointed.\nIn fact the closest I get to a real explanation is the planned twist, something I foreshadow from the start which covers a topic I am more comfortable with.']",12/5/2020 14:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secret Santa Series6

Hey guys, you'll find the link to the series where all the submissions are posted with a link to the bio of everyone who participated. Thanks for participating again; I think this is the 5th year I have been doing the Secret Santa on Tapastic? Yeesh.Anyhoo, go check it out but know that I am rolling out everyone's presents as I make this post so if you don't see yours, give it a few minutes.

Original Gift
If you want a copy of your Secret Santa gift, please email or message me on the forums and I will send you full sized gift.

Confession
Everything almost went 100% smoothly; no one dropped out, no one disappeared, everyone finished relatively on time.... But I did end up making a mistake, as you will see on the main site. I ended up messing up assignments and failed to realize until the deadline. So somebody is gonna have two Secret Santa gifts and two people are gonna have gifts from me.

Feedback
I fell way behind because of the assignment mess up so I didn't make a survey again. It's best to get a survey up at the time this forum is posted, otherwise few will bother to fill it out. So basically, if you think there needs to be any big changes or wish to express any concerns, please just let me know here or in the DMs.

Again, thank you everyone for participating and I hope you have a good new year. Keep up the arts and the writing
And I'll see ya again next Christmas

76,2020 Tapas Secret Santa Sign-Ups,Events | Challenges,[],"[Secret Santa Survey] TBA
Secret Santa Deadline: December 25th
Secret Santa Reveal: December 31st

Hellooo, it's that time of the year again! Time for the secret santa!
My Intro
My name is JJ and I draw my comic Beautiful Lies6. I've been creating this Secret Santa event since 2015 (I believe??) even when I was on hiatus.In the Secret Santa, all artists and writers get to draw each other's OCs and see the results on the main site here18. It's a great way to have some fun, find new stories, and test your skills!
Previous Secret Santas: 20195 | 20182 | 2017 | 2016 | 20152


How it Works
Anyone who would like to participate can sign up using the link provided above or here41. In this event, you will be assigned to someone's comic or novel at random and have until the deadline to draw the character(s) your assignee requests in the theme they want. If they give no special requests, it's up to your creativity.
You can specify whether you want to draw or write, but you cannot choose whether you will receive an illustration or short story for your gift. You can specify a preference, but because there may not be enough artists to supply, you get what you get. This should minimise chaos and allow everyone to be included.

The Pandemic
This year is a little different as we all are aware. So, I wanted to add the option of having a theme to the gift relating to the pandemic.
Perhaps it could be how the characters are finding new ways to celebrate the holidays, how they are handling being thrown into a new situation or maybe just their daily lives! It's up to you and your assignee! 
This is optional, you're free to specify if you want your gift to have the theme or not. I originally liked the idea of having a host's theme each year but I'm not sure what else I would want to do. I felt this was a relevant topic that could be creatively integrated if one wished.

Rules
Make sure you read through these and ask questions if needed.
Requirements

You must sign up through the Google forms link in order to participate in the event
You must have an original novel or comic on Tapas with at least one complete chapter that includes the character/characters you want in the Secret Santa
You must provide appropriate references, specified in Rules below
If you try to sign up with an OC that does not meet the above requirements, you will not be able to participate.

References


For comics: You must have at least one full body, coloured reference of your character. It does not have to be ""good,"" it just needs colour so we know what they look like!


For novels: You must provide a (drawn or written) physical description of your character/characters. If you have a unique setting you want your character to be in, make sure to describe this as well.
This can be provided through links to specific pages or writing a custom description on the sign-up form
Any drawn references need to follow the same guidelines as for comics.



Signing Up

In the sign-up, name any special requests
Indicate if you want to join the Host theme
Specify your willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and make two secret santas?)
After the sign up deadline has passed, you will receive a participant number and everyone will be given a Secret Santa at random.

Before the deadline

A week before the deadline, I will message everyone who hasn't completed their works to make sure they are still able to participate. Please respond to me so I know you're still working on it.
If I don't receive responses, I will assume you have dropped out and will assign volunteers to finish the remaining secret santas.

Completion
When you have completed your piece, email it to me here 
  zedyas.studio@gmail.com


Please include the following in your email: ""Secret Santa"" and your participant number (not your secret santa's!!)Drawings can be in any picture format. Short stories must be a Word document or PDF file.


Rule on Dropping Out
People disappear a lot and it can cause inconveniences so I've had to raise issue on this last year.

If you need to drop out, for whatever reason, please send me a message on Tapas or by email 5 days prior to the deadline. This gives volunteers time to make a second gift.
If you fail to notify me ahead of time or just disappear, your story will not be spotlighted in the Secret Santa.
If you do not respond to my messages, you may not be able to sign up for future events.
If you think you may not be able to commit or may not be motivated to finish your piece, then I recommend you do not sign up. There's been chaos in the past when people have disappeared after the deadline. It is a great inconvenience to people and as much as I'd love everyone to participate, I shouldn't chance it either.

Point is: know your limits. 

Additional Comments

I really encourage you read at least a little of your assignee's work. The point of the event is to discover new stories but this will also help you gain a better idea of the characters.

Short story word count: Currently, I don't have a word count requirement as I'm not familiar with short story writing. I would suggest following the 3,000-5,000 word count guideline. Keeping it under 10,000 but over 1,000 is the suggestion, but not a requirement, for now.
Don't overdo it with requests. You're free to request what you want in your gift but participants can only allocate so much time to the event commission-free.

77,"[Tapas Insider] Reflections on 2020 (Chance to Win 5,000 Bonus Ink!)",Events | Challenges,[],"2020 has been a year of healing for me. I know that sounds contradictory during a pandemic. I was in an incredibly negative environment that was damaging to me both physically and mentally. In what could be perceived as an unfortunate incident at the time, put me in a situation where I am valued and cherished. I have been able to unlearn these toxic behaviors that I adopted to protect myself and heal. The progress I've made in the last six months has been extraordinary. I am proud of what I've been able to accomplish since being allowed to heal.","[""Honestly 2020 has been good to me. I've gotten better at my art and storytelling. Dragon Sparking hit 100 subs, 1000 Likes, and 8000 views. \nI entered the Tezuka Manga Contest, started a collaboration with @jensrichard77 on a comic that will be amazing. Celebrated the 10th anniversary of my marriage, and got a promotion at work. \n2020 has hit a lot of people hard, but I've been really blessed this year, even through the hardship. 2021 will be even better."", ""My biggest milestone of the year is definitely that I finally finished the first chapter of my comic! I feel like it has solidified my desire to complete this story.\n\nch 1 screenshot.png917x605 385 KB\n\nI also made some changes to the art style starting in chapter 2, and it has made me very proud of how my work looks now. I liked the previous painted look, but the new style almost looks more polished.\n\nch2p10.jpg789x1177 289 KB\n\nI've just made a lot of progress with my artwork in general, despite some IRL issues."", ""My comic has kind of been the bright spot in an otherwise stressful year where I had to cancel my wedding for safety and lost my grandmother and one of my in-laws. It's honestly really helped me keep my spirits up in spite of everything!\nI managed to finish up my prologue, got all the way through chapter 1 and started chapter 2, got a community pick, a staff pick and another front page feature and I'm just coming up to 750 subs, so three quarters of the way to a thousand. I'm pretty happy with that, given that Action is a smaller genre on the platform.I'm feeling accomplished and looking forward to pushing on next year and trying to hit that big 1k!"", ""Not going to lie, this year has been super awful and so many stressful and bad things happened that I almost quit at Tapas alltogether. But a roleplaying thread here on the forums of all things introduced me to a bunch of people who I became friends with. Some of them helped me and I regained my motivation and confidence again.\nI'm super thankful for that rp thread honestly, even if it is closed now, because without the people in it that I rp'ed with I would have left Tapas half a year ago"", 'In my real lifeEven that many people have lost their jobs, and I’m so sorry for you, I am however grateful of having a day job as security that is needed in this crazy time.\nAt TapasI have never felt so creative and popular in my webcomic writing and have managed to create some good stuff with my good friends here at Tapas.Encluding @ratique @nathanKmcwilliams @arpeggiomax87 @Starlexic @KingCrazyI have never felt more like home and even take the role of helping my fellow creators with other serious personal matter and have resolved and sorted out unnecessary drama where everyone came out happy in the end.   \nI even have my own Discord community that I’m very proud of. \nBut most of all.

Its been an amazing year and I'm so happy I started to post here on tapas, my comic received a Staff pick early on, and Community pick and another future on the front page during inksgiving and it all gave me such a great boost (both comic wise and confidence wise) and found myself getting a bunch of amazing and kind  readers <3\nI haven't regretted a thing about this comic and I thought it would be a lot more struggle to keep up the motivation for it than it has been so far but already got 2 chapters finished that's given me a great buffer and the 3rd chapter is fully roughed out and a bit into coloring and I cant wait to get it all out there \n\nCOMICPROGRESS.jpg1000x463 126 KB\n"", ""I'm gonna be honest, 2020's been a hard year for me and a lot of people in general. I've had to wrestle with a lot of deep seated issues regarding me and my relationship with my own creative works that I had been struggling with unknowingly for a long while this year. I've learned a lot about myself and finally got to the bottom of a lot of those problems this year and have been working on getting a healthier relationship with my art and self esteem in general and have been making huge strides in that and growing as a person as a result this year. So that's been a good thing even if it has been rough getting there over the year....\nI've also made some of my closest friends here on Tapastic this year that have really helped me with my struggles and have always been there for me as well. So that is something good that happened this year that I am always thankful for as well."", '2020 started for me with seeing an incredible real life sports story unfold when an underdog athlete won junior worlds title—and it came with movie-like hype around his opponents and a team-mate who was hailed as the new dawn for his sport nationally. And two silver medals in huge events, losing by a sliver. And—I kid you not—climbing from 13th position to the 3rd in junior nationals almost missing his chance to go to junior worlds... but in the end, the kid won his hard-earned gold...\nAfter that, the things went haywire—I lost my long awaited trip to the world championship (senior), and COVID locked down the world.\nOn personal note, I kept writing, finishing my Magnum Opus, She Kills Elephants And Men in 2020\nWriting the cutest How to Marry Your Dragon, and the novel that was warmly received here, on Tapas, Trapped by the Mafia.\nI also wrote an experimental YA novel, Lone Werewolf (that I will be posting into 2021).\nBy the very end of the year, I received a writing award on a book written in 2019, the book I almost didn’t enter in the contest, that I thought was pointless to even upload on the Internet. \nIt was a soft story with an overweight, failed PhD candidate, a librarian male love interest. And a burned-out figure skater...\nOn the Internet, where the romances are all about Abusive Mr. Abs Billionaires...\nI didn’t expect it from 2020, but somehow it happened to me. \nAnd I am still pinching myself.', ""This was defintly the big silver linning in the 2020 dark cloud. \n2020 was the year I signed up for Tapas and Launched Gamers Guff and Online Hassle, \nThis was back in June and I'm already close to reaching 100 subscribers, \nI plan on keeping up the momentum, reach for the stars on Tapas and pitch my ideas for a Tapas Original Series. \nIn the mean time, I'm very proud of what I've accomplished so far, \nThe best is yet to come, \n\nComic Cover Update.png960x1440 535 KB\n\n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nGamers Guff | Tapas\nMeet Dave and Ryan, two brothers who are as polar opposite as you can imagine. \n\nBut the one thing they both have in common, they both love video games.

And honestly, I kind of mean that in a good way. COVID has been a beast to deal with, yes, but...it's been a surprisingly good year for me. It started with me in an apartment I didn't like with roommates I was very distant from, working a job that didn't appreciate the work I put in, and paid very poorly. Then COVID hit. In order to keep my sanity, I moved back in with my parents so I'd at least have room to go outside and walk. I'd been looking for a new job since last October, and suddenly in June, I had an interview for a job I'd applied for in December. Shortly thereafter, I went on a socially-distanced vacation to the beach with my immediate family, and it was lovely. In fact, it was the best time I've had at the beach in a very long time! While on vacation, I got a call that I'd gotten the job! Just a little while after that, I hit my 2 year anniversary for my comic. I've stuck with it for 2 years, and it feel so amazing to me!! That's longer than I've lasted on almost any project ever! After I started my new job, I found an apartment that I like a lot more, in a much safer area, with a new roommate who I get along with much better than I ever did the others! To top it all off, at beginning of the COVID lockdowns, I found my way to a really great Discord server where I've made a lot of really great creator friends. They've helped me get through all this, and I can't thank them enough for their friendship and all their help with my comic!  So despite COVID, it's been a good year for me. I know it's been horrible in a lot of aspects for a lot of people, but I have been so lucky and blessed."", '2020 has allowed me to reflect on myself and focus on my physical health, which has always been a tad askew, and I have been seeing some improvements already. During the pandemic and BLM, I have grown to discover who my real friends are and know who makes me feel safe and respected as a person. This year has given me time to take risks and even win some awards in music and given me time to expand on more creative outlets like writing. This year has been one of reflecting and healing for sure.', ""2020 has definitely been a rough year for me mentally. From lockdowns, to hours cut at work, to ultimately my job going completely bye bye due to both COVID and my bosses health, to being cooped up at home with nowhere to go and no money to go there with, there have admittedly been very few bright spots in this year and the few I've had have been hard to latch on to through all the murk. But I am definitely proud of the fact that as bleak as it's gotten, I've been able to find ways to keep going. That is a simple win in a dark world, but a win all the same. And I'm really happy I was able to be there for my now former boss during this. I kept things running at work to the best of my abilities, becoming essentially a manager with no actual training in some of the things I managed. It was stressful at times and lord knows job hunting in a COVID world isn't what I wanted, but being able to rise to the challenges and be able to make my boss feel like she could just focus on her health and leave the business behind means the world to me. In the end, she made the best decision for her by closing the business but I left knowing that I did everything I could to help her and as conceited as this might sound, I was the glue that kept things together for 9 months. But it was so very hard to watch her break down in tears while she notified all our clients. That broke my heart.\nIn terms of my writing, I haven't gotten much done. I'm working on posting the remaining chapters of my Draygon sequel and hoping to bring a few more books over from Wattpad. But I was so very happy to unlock the support feature in my books this year. For all my confidence issues when it comes to my writing, just knowing I have a chance to earn actual money has meant the world to me. I went in thinking I wouldn't get a single support, and I wound up getting 9. The warm fuzzies I got knowing people liked my books enough to do that has been incredible. I hope that once things settle in my life and I can resume writing new material again I can use that to empower me through anything. It's another one that in the grand scheme of things is a simple pleasure, but it's still a pleasure.\nThat being said...get out of here, 2020. And don't let the door hit you on the way out "", ""2020 has been a WILD year and for me, a lot of it has been all about change.\n\nMy spouse and I moved across the country \nI'm working on separating from the military and starting a new chapter in my life\nDevilish Cupcakes released! \n\nI'm probably most proud of Devilish Cupcakes. I'm thrilled that Tapas wanted to work with me on another novel and I really feel like I've leveled up a bit as a writer, with that, I made the decision to change my major for my Master's degree to English/Creative writing and really start to put myself on the path of making writing my full-time job (eventually)\nLots of big things happened this year and I'm so grateful to my friends and family for their support. And I'm even more grateful to have this platform, which launched me back into writing.  "", ""2020 has been one heck of a year. A few bad things happened to me and other people but overall it's been great. I had to adjust a little bit because I had to do online school. At first, it was hard because I had never done online work before this but now I'm doing great, My grades are good and I'm a lot less stressed. I am sad that I haven't seen my friends in months and I can't do any school clubs. I discovered Tapas this year and it was honestly the best thing ever! I love all the stories here and I often lose track of time while I'm on the app! I never thought a year like 2020 would happen, but it did and I wouldn't change a thing!"", ""This year has been... Something different. I can't say that for me has been terrible or amazing, I had to get through a lot of emocional issues but at the same time I have get rid of some bad things in mi life. This year has brought me the opportunity to discover new things, rediscover things that I forgot I loved and has helped me to discover myself. I'm proud of the good changes that I have done to my own self and the opportunity to keep improving myself. I may not be proud of the person I am right now, but of the person that I can become.Also, this year I got to spend more time with my younger siblings, and that has been really amazing for me.

80,Tapas character tier list!,Events | Challenges,[],"That's right, you heard it correct! I had a little idea for a sort of community themed event so here it is, the tapas character tierlist!
Basically we just fill in our character(s) on this template, just for fun:
20201216_145804.jpg1080x771 50.5 KB

And that way we get a neat little list ^^How does this work you may ask? Well, with a ton of polls of course! But you are not going to vote for yourself, but instead for others! And others will vote for you!Step 1: reply to the thread with your character (preferably a close up to the face so they are more visible on the tierlist later).Also include a description of who your character is and what they do. It helps.Step 2: include a poll in your comment with the same options as the tiers (S, A, B, C, D, E and F). Set them on single answer only. If you introduce more characters don't forget that each character needs their own poll.Step 3: Vote on the polls of everyone else, that way we'll get results for each character.Step 4: After a week I'll compile the results. The most voted answer per poll counts for that character. 
Other rules:- It's encouraged to regularly revisit the thread and vote for newcomers. That way we don't end up with a voting bottleneck- Try to be honest in your vote, but don't vote bad just because you want to troll others. Be courteous.- When voting, think of what you like and dislike about a character and you can base your vote on that.- If you are a novelist you can use guest art for your character. That way I can still include a picture in the tierlist.- Try to resist voting for yourself lol
If you have any more questions just ask! I'll start things off:

TIME OUT
Genre: Fantasy Drama Suspense
Blurb: Sandra Williams finds herself in deep waters when her family falls prey to one of the most dangerous organizations of the nation. The police won’t help, all authorities have turned their backs. She has nothing but one powerful family to rely on to owe her a favour, but only when she saves their son’s life. The problem, though?
He died one year ago.
Link:

Update of the rules:
The winners will be decided on the basis of participation:

If participants are 1-6: Three winners for comment display and the same three will get a separate page for promotion.
7-9: Top three will get a comment display and top four will have their stories promoted.
10-12: Top three will get their comments displayed and top six will have their stories promoted.

Thank you for your participation!","['Just wanted to say congrats on finishing your season!', ""Leaving my blurb here because Tapas is bugged and won't let me leave comments on episodes. \nTime Out by Dysis is a brooding and atmospheric journey filled with magic, mystery and danger.

91,Many ends to the same beginning.- Write a short story![Closed],Events | Challenges,[],"I've been sitting on this idea(which isn't original at all !) for a week, thinking, ""Should I make this an event or not?"" People have come up with something like this way before I did.We even have to write something like this in our exams in school here.
I don't know how many people will be interested in doing this though.
We'll be taking the exact same beginning of a story and make it our own, adding to it, changing it, forming a story we'd like to read ourselves.
Whoever's interested, these are the rules:-I'll leave the starting of a short story below. You can take that and make any kind of story you want.-You will have to keep the starting the same. The change comes in the story you tell.-The limit on character count is the 15000 tapas allows. [I said 'character' not 'word'.]-It will be a single chapter story.-Publish it separately from what you're writing primarily and leave the link here.[If you want, you can take it down after the time of this event expires.]-It doesn't matter which genre it is, as long as you write what you like. (But make it interesting. Interesting short stories feel great.)-Those who take part in this, go check out each other's ones and leave a comment there.-This isn't a competition and there are no rewards. It's just for the sake of us having some fun and possibly some escape from the grind of writing parts of a single(or multiple, if you're talented, unlike me) storyline(s).-Mark your chapter with the mature sign if it includes something that might be disturbing to others.

You can make the ending as messed up as you want, even leave it on a cliffhanger if you feel like it. But make sure to address the conflict of your story. Make sure that even if the story ends, the end is not 'The End'.(If that makes sense.)

With that outta the way, here's the starting we're gonna use:
 It was a quiet evening. Jacob was driving his car by the side of a lake when he heard a crash. 
This thread will be open for three days from the time I open it. So, if you're up for it, why not?
I guess I'll start writing mine now. ",[],0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

116,Inksgiving 2020 giving and receiving List. (｡’▽’｡)♡,Events | Challenges,[],"So it (will be) the time of the year, folks. Inksgiving is here (soon)! 
If you haven't seen the announcement somehow, here's the post : 



CREATORS: Inksgiving 2020 is here! Events


    [image] 

Hello fellow Creator!

It is this time of the year again! Inksgiving, our annual event where your readers are incentivized to support you with Ink, is right around the corner. I would like to invite you to make an announcement episode and/or social media post for Inksgiving, if you’re up for it! We want to ensure that all your readers are aware of the event, and support you as much as possible - Tapas makes no money with Inksgiving, all proceeds go straight to you! 

This year’s Inksgi…
  

Go read it, it have some great templates you can modified to create an announcement on your own.
And just like last year and the year before, I'm making this thread so we can have a big thread of the giving and receiving list. If you have any plan of your own Inksgiving, post it below!
So for this year, I want you to link your own series/profile and one of the other creator you love! 
The only rule is to not link the direct episode/chapter link and tto make sure you and the other creator have their support unlocked and only two links per post (which mean only yours and the other Creator's link).
I didn't know if it is possible to unlocking it via email to michaelson like last year yet but if it is I'll update the post.
I will try to give everyone on the list some inks. I don't have much, but I probably can spare 30~50 Inks per creator if there's a lot in this list (cause being broke is something (/ω＼)).
So lemme start by one of my favourite creator here :

THE JAM IS UNDERWAY!
THE THEME IS:
SECOND CHANCE

Hello, everyone! This thread is a direct result of this one8. In case you misssed it, this is basically going to be a short, unofficial, one-month long experience in which novelists gather around and produce a mini-series based on a given theme.
The overall goal is to let the creators take a break from some of their longer-running series, find satisfaction of completing a work, and engage in each other's works through the shared experience.
This process will work in four steps:


Theme Submission: People post in the thread ideas for a potential theme. This can be anything you want as long as it can be limited to a single sentence. Please keep in mind that it should ideally be something that, while flexible, gives writers a general direction to look toward to. Something like a single word might be a bit too broad, whereas a specific character start/motivation could be too specific for certain genre writers. The best advice I can give is that, before suggesting a theme, you consider what ideas you could come up with it. 
Submissions should be limited to one theme per person.
The main reason why the themes should not be entirely vague is that, after the Jam ends, writers will have a lot more incentive to check out others' works to see how they interpreted the theme, and what direction they took with their story. For example, if the theme was just the word ""horse"", there's a million stories that could feature them. There's not going to be any connective tissue behind the submitted stories, and the fun of seeing where people took the initial idea is lost. If the theme is, on the other hand, something like: ""A Ruler Becomes a Monster"", that gives the general direction of the main plot point, while allowing for a lot of wiggle room. Is it a figurative or actual monster? Is it a fantasy ruler (king) or an etherial being governing over a universe, or an AI, or...? Is it told from the Ruler's perspective or someone else's? Etc., etc., etc.



Theme Voting: The suggested themes will be rounded up and placed in a poll in the OP, where people will be able to vote for their preferred theme. Theme with most votes becomes the official jam theme. In case of a tie or an incredibly close call, and if a large enough number of authors step up to say the winning theme simply does not work for them, I am perfectly willing to compromise and make it so that authors can choose between the top two themes.That said, I would hope such a scenario does not happen, as I feel like it would take away a part of the fun.


Writing: After the theme has been decided, the jam ""officially"" begins, and will last for a month.
I am personally of the opinion that people should not post their entires or the chapters here during this period, but rather that people do it all at the same time of the deadline. Which would inevitably lead us to the last stage.
Entrants, however, will be free to post excerpts/tease their work/discuss their progress and woes.



Work Submission: On a given deadline, everyone submits what they made. The OP is continually updated with a comprehensive list of authors and their works. People can check out and discuss each other's works. As I said, I am sort of banking on the fact that other authors are more willing to engage in each other's work if they feel some inherent connection to them. I would also think that the number of applicants will not be as high, allowing for a sort of honor system where it's assumed everyone checks out each other's work, expecting the others to do the same.
There will be no ranking or rewards. I feel like that would go against the spirit of the jam, which is about productivity and engaging with each other's works.
Having said that, if the number of submissions ends up being insanely high (we're talking 20+ works), it is unreasoanble to think every person would be able to read every work. Therefore, I am willing to install a voting system to declare the single story people thought was the best.
The way it would work is that every participant would be able to vote for one of the entries only if they had publicly reviewed a certain percentage of the works (this would be determined in consultation with the entrants and based on the actual number of storiess). Otherwise, their vote would not count. Obviously, people would not be able to vote for themselves.
This does create a danger of everyone somehow reviewing the same handful of stories, but, for the time being, that is an edge-case I am hoping will not come to be.
Either way, I would not be enforcing people to read a specific list of stories to allow for diversity. Again, goes against the general spirit of things and creates an awkward situation if the reader ends up not liking certain stories but still has to post a review.


All of that said, voting or no voting, feedback or no feedback, there is still the undeniable benefit of producing a completed work that may very well be checked out by people browsing through Tapas, not to mention can be shipped around the Forums in other self-promotion threads and such.



Some general notes:

If it was not made clear before, this is for novels only.
Everyone is allowed to submit theme, regardlesss of whether or not they're joining. That said, I would prefer if you submitted them only if you intended to join, simply because some themes that sound cool are far more difficult to work with if you're the person that has to make something out of it.
You do not need to explicitly declare you're joining. Your participation is ultimately declared when you submit something at the deadline.
Works should be limited to no more than six episodes. With the average chapter limitation being to around 2.6k words, I think that gives you more than enough space work with. I originally wanted to limit it to five, but I am aware there are people who want to add short little prologues that aren't high in word count and serve more as mood-setters, so there ya go.
This one is important: please try to have your works completed. If you don't finish in time, that's fine, go right ahead and submit; what I'm saying is that you should not end up with six chapters of what is ultimately a part of a larger story or a setup to something you will keep writing after the fact. Try to think about beginnings and endings from the very start. Your works should be their own, standalone work.
Your works should be standalone. Please try not to write explicit tie-ins to one of your existing works, unless it requires no actual knowledge of this other work. Fanfiction is fine, since I know a lot of the writing populace here is focused on it, but please keep in mind that people who are not familiar with the work you're tying into will likely not be able to engage.

Submissions here should be made explicitly as a result of the jam. What I am saying is, if you already have a pre-existing work that you feel ties into the given theme, that's okay, but do not submit it here. This will be for original works made explicitly for this event.

Timeline:
The way I see it, the timeline of events should be something like this:


October 5th-8th: Theme Submission [x]

October 8th-11th: Theme Voting [x]

October 11th-November 11th: Writing [x]

November 11th: Submissions [o]

Reasoning for the theme submission/voting period being only a week long is that I don't feel like it should take that much time to come up with a theme, and even less time to pick something on a poll.
That's it from me! If you've got any comments/suggestions/potential changes, feel free to share!
As a side-note, if you caught some words lacking an 's' or having a strange surplus of them, it's because my 's' key is acting funky. Partially because overheating my laptop with Risk of Rain 2 madness was a bad idea.

128,Inksgiving 2020 (Let me support you!) [CONTEST CLOSED/WINNERS DECIDED],Events | Challenges,[],"Good afternoon friendos and fellow creatives! This year is the first year I can truly participate in Inksgiving as I have ink to give and my own support has been unlocked. I've been on Tapas for a little over a year and I can say that this is the funnest social site I've ever been a part of. I'm really grateful for the support I've received on my hard work and also for the many friends I've made. So, I want to have a lil ""contest""! I will be leaving this thread open for one week. By next Tuesday (around noon EST) I will be choosing three people to gift ink too. The winner will receive 1,600 ink. And whoever places 2nd and third will receive 400.
Ω The Rules Ω1. Show me one of your works and what it's about. All genres welcome. Comics and novels both welcome. Impress me! I want to support you!2. You must be subbed to my series ""Red Shift"". People who are already subbed are welcome but be wary that if we interact quite a bit, you're unlikely to be chosen because I'll probably gift you ink this year anyways lmao. (And only sub if you're ok with seeing my work after the contest - none of this sub/unsub silliness! I'll post info about my series below and you can gauge if you're interested or not.)
So, what's my work all about? Well, ""Red Shift"" is an ongoing multimedia New Gods novel series that falls within dark science-fiction (cosmic horror, military, cyberpunk, dystopia). I do all the art, writing, and music for it.

I kinda want everyone who entered my contest to get one, haha. \nHmmm I think I just want a clarification on the mature content thingy for novels. I never actually write explicit sex scenes but there is like... Suggested sex in it and sometimes some really tame lead-ups (like, I think a character touched a boob once, LOL?). My story already got a staff-pick awhile back, but I'm just wondering if stories with really tame sexual content like mine are still able to get staff-picks or if it has to be really tame and family friendly? I also noticed that Secunda got a staff-pick once or twice (maybe more) and it has some pretty explicit scenes, so I guess I'm sorta wondering where the line is drawn? Also, is it a thing that staff-picks can happen more than once now?\nI dunno, mature content on this site is always a head-scratcher haha.\nThanks for clarifying this!

142,JOIN US! Halloween Zoom Horror Comic Art Drawing Class with some Tapas members!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey All 
Thought would let you know that Adrenaline Shots Comics (us!) is doing its bit to ensure that Halloween is not cancelled in these strange times and will therefore soon be running one of the most unconventional live art classes ever!
Are any of you interested in drawing horror comics? Are you staying indoors for Halloween? If your answer was 'yes' to one of those questions, you'll want to take a class from Mistress Morphine, who will be your musical Bob Ross for the evening, as she hosts her very own macabre Masterclass, filled with art, song and plenty of blood.

TAPAS MissMorphine-Poster-Art-OptionB.jpg819x1154 446 KB

This Halloween, join us and Mistress Morphine - the vampire, nurse, dominatrix (she’s a triple threat, literally!) and hostess of our sci-fi and horror webcomic anthology hosted here on Tapas - within the hallowed halls of Morphine Manor itself via the power of Zoom! 
Be part of the fearsome festivities with tips and guidance on horror art via Zoom and a roster of awesome artists including the Forum's own @joannekwan and @edmourabarbosa 
It wouldn’t be Halloween without a few surprises, and Mistress Morphine has more than a handful of tricks up her sleeve, so look out for one or two familiar horror film faces on the night too...oh, and did I mention that it's also a rock musical?  
To commemorate the event, an exclusive limited edition poster (see below) has been created by artist Matt Ryan Tobin, who has created very memorable posters for Mondo and Texas Frightmare Weekend. The print will only be available to be won as a prize for the participants who are selected by the judges on the night as the best of the evening, so get practising you guys!

The show begins at 1 pm EDT on October 31st. Tickets are via Eventbrite:

Adrenaline Shots Live - Mistress Morphine’s Macabre Art Masterclass
This All Hallows Eve join Mistress Morphine, everyone's favourite Nurse / Vampire / Dominatrix, for a most unusual comic art class.






But be warned, the show has some naughty bits (as do we all!) So if you are offended by adult language and comedy, then this may not be for you.
Halloween is not cancelled!

157,Content and Community Guidelines Update,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey, regarding you saying uncensored genitals are not allowed in comics, up until now I have been under the impression that flaccid/unaroused/not sexually displayed lower body nudity is allowed to be left uncensored as long as it's behind a mature content warning. Has this changed?
For example if someone drew Näcken (a mythological creature that lures people into the lake using the allure of his music) in their comic, would they need to choose between lightsaber or a leg covering the naked bits?","['Ah okay.\nFuck Apple and America ', 'YAY FOR CLARITY ON NOVELS!!! Thanks for the update, Tapas Team!! ', 'Awesome, my novel is legal again. I mean what?', 'Sweet! At least we now knew the length of what we can or cannot do for sex scene now. ', ""Oh, so now we can't have any genitals in what we depict, even if we don't care to be featured on the app? This is completely not consistent with what I was told when this site began. Of course, I'm not surprised; sites like this enjoy forming their foundations with the work of more daring authors, then they decide they're too good for us. Even when it's something completely mundane like nudity, which is not sex and cannot be legally conflated with it.\nIf that's the case, I'll be leaving the site, but I will certainly not be censoring my work any more than I already do. I wish I could say it was a pleasure, but it wasn't."", 'its generally more because tapas was removed from the apple play store multiple times at this point.', ""So?\nI don't care. I don't work for Apple, and they don't compensate me for my work. I also didn't ask for inclusion in the app store, and additionally, Tapas have hidden us from results long before they had their app store issues. They deserve zero loyalty from someone they have never been willing to support.\nThey use our creative work to cash in, which we see a fraction of, if we see anything...which is unlikely and exceedingly rare."", ""Well, Tapas does need their app support, even more now that they get no money when ink is donated to artists. It does suck that it has to be like this, and I do hope your next place has more open guidelines, but that ends up happening eventually when the mobile audience is the biggest draw and you can't keep getting banned because Apple's moderation legitimately is horrible for everyone(re: Artstation getting banned for things they didn't show openly on the app but Apple insisted they did and didn't budge)."", ""Will we be getting a notification somewhere besides these forums? I don't have this type of nudity as of now, but I never wanted to be part of the app, regardless of nudity. \nI'm not here on the forum side very often: I have a lot of other stuff going on, so it'd be nice to know how to opt out of the app. It's confusing to me, because some stuff is announced here on the forums, but I feel it really should be announced on the comic part of this site (side-note: why are these separated like this? Are their plans to consolidate the updates/responses? Just curious). \nAnyway, I hope we receive an update, because the last thing I want is to be accused of being non-compliant, when all policy changes are announced in the forum.\n(Edit: This is not to say Tapas doesn't do the announcement elsewhere, this is just the first time I've even heard of the newer update. If it's not going to be announced in our feed, I think that's very negligible on Tapas: how can we comply, if we're not informed? And to be honest, I'm not super active in these forums and I think there are many others who are also not here a lot. I talk more to commenters and creators on their actual comic pages.) \nThank you for your time and response."", 'Ah, okay, I see it. I didn\'t realize that\'s where those announcements went. I prefer a ""notification,"" but that\'s fine. I probably just missed it. \nThank you for your time.', 'Hey hi hello! \nI remember that I told I do not want to participate in discussions anymore, so you can call my behavior inconsistent...  but I just decided to make a change in my personal guidelines toward premium series discussions (yes, I constrantly change my guidlines.

I believe, that even if my rotten mind see here a beautiful male\'s private part, it\'s not what creators meant.

One of the many challenges we face at Tapas is simultaneously developing the mobile web, web, and mobile app experiences for both readers and creators. We’ve been focusing a lot of our attention recently to the development of our mobile apps which caused a lack of parity between the reader functionality of the website and apps. Our goal was to address this along with other reader experience issues with the new update, but we also acknowledge this update missed the mark on a lot of creator related experiences, and introduced some unintended bugs. 
We apologize for the confusion that this has led to and I’m sorry if any of the updates have upset you. That’s not our intention and we acknowledge how you’re feeling. It’s always been our goal to provide an open and safe space for publishing, and build a platform that continually evolves alongside our creator community. Many of the user experience and user interface updates that we launched on the app has led to a significant increase in reader exploration of new series and long term reader retention. We had hoped to bring these improvements over to the web while also revamping the general aesthetics. 
We hear you when you say you miss the personality that the previous look and feel of Tapas had - and we hope to address this soon. As for the stark use of white, we were prepping the site for new reader modes that would fill in the negative space. 
We are reviewing all feedback being provided and will work on addressing those along with the bugs. As always, I’ll be answering questions in this forum topic as well. In order to help us organize your feedback, it would be helpful if you could also use the form below. Much appreciated.

UPDATE
Thank you every one for providing us feedback. We'll be diligently working on addressing the concerns expressed by the creator community and hope to implement changes both big and small in a timely fashion. We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this time. Again, I'd like to reiterate our appreciation for the passion, criticism, and support of the community. We are dedicated to making necessary changes to ensure more readers and creators have a fun, engaging, rewarding, and unique experience whenever reading and creating stories on Tapas. 
We apologize for any hurt we have caused with today's update, again, it's never our intention and we completely acknowledge our need for improvement. I hope you understand that we are trying our best to be as accommodating as possible and want to create a relationship with you all that reinforces our willingness to engage in healthy discussions and enact positive changes. We will always do our best to answer questions that arise and be candid in what we can and cannot do. 
Thank you again for your continued support, we'll be continuing active correspondence in this topic, updating this parent post with additional changes, and keep you as up to date as possible.

I expect more from SDCC since it's a much much much bigger con so they might have the budget to keep some good panels."", ""I go to SDCC almost every year (live in LA so it's only a 3-hour drive).

We're talking shoulder to shoulder, no room to yourself, have to push people to get through sometimes, crowded. But the cosplays are amazing! I admit I go more for the pop culture aspect of the con than the comic aspect, but just being surrounded by like minded nerds is also a lot of fun.

If you have facebook or Twitter search for the Unofficial San Diego Comic Con blog. They're really great about keeping people up to date with information and it's usually very accurate despite them being unofficial. They're my go-to for source before the con then during the con some of the bigger rooms I usually try to get into have their own twitters to help people keep informed of line conditions.\nThis would've been my 6th year attending as a badge holder, 7th in general since I went down one year when I couldn't get a badge and just enjoyed the off site stuff."", ""Yeah I kinda imagined how crowded the place is.

For example, an enby lesbian writing a gay romance story, or a cis pan man writing a trans story, etc. Rather than giving lgbt+ a chance to talk about their own experiences, you gave lgbt+ people a chance to talk about other people's identities. While having lgbt+ content highlighted in general is always good, pride month has always been about self identity, struggles, and of course pride. It felt, to me at least and to some other creators I talked to, like it was a misstep to channel the resources you had and give platform to something that's based on interpretations of experiences rather than actual real experiences of the lgbt+ people the comics you're promoting and asking questions about are about.Also, considering the vastness of the lgbt+ community, and the fact all the comics were hand picked, it felt like there was a huge focus on gay (white) men, by which I mean, if I recall correctly, every single comic had a gay white man main character- but not a single comic (as far as I saw) had, say, an asexual character? \nI think it's particularly important considering how much of tapas users are younger lgbt+ folk, and how much the community and site thrives on lgbt+ content. Particularly paired with things like the sheer amount of mlm trope-y, rape-romanticizing comics are constantly being pushed by tapas on social media and being bought and presented under tapas premium. \nP.S.If you're going to handpick creators, at least try and make sure they don't post borderline biphobic & aphobic comments on their social media."", 'There were definitely some... missteps there, to say the least.', ""Me and Lord Vincent are doing this:\n\n\ntapas.io7\n\n\n\nPride Project 2020 | Tapas\nA collection of interviews, essays, musings, and stories from LGBTQ+ Tapas Creators about their work, their lives, and creating art.\n\nMore information coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already have got a list of intersectional creators involved (about 10 or 11), both BIPOC, disabled, people from all over the LGBTQ spectrum and I'm conducting the interviews with an ethical framework that's more in keeping with 'taking testimony' than it is in 'promotion'.

Due to a problem with my account that is currently being resolved, this giveaway has been put on hold and will continue as soon as it's resolved and I have things back in order!

Hey there, I'm FeastOfNoise, author of Siren of the Desert and the newly-published Mating Season. To celebrate Mating Season crossing the 1K subscribers milestones, I'm doing an ink giveaway! It's my way of giving back to the Tapas community, and to Tapas itself, even if it's a little bit. 
The prizes are a total of 12,000 ink! I will randomly draw a total of 6 lucky winners using an app, and each winner gets 2000 inks! I'll be drawing on the 1st of June, my mother's birthday, and the reason why I'm selecting 6 winners!  
The rules of entry into the draw are simple. All you need to do is 1) subscribe to Mating Season and 2) comment on Episode 4 The Lesser Of Two Evils (which is a free chapter btw) to qualify! That way, I can account for all the comments after the 15th of May, the day of this announcement's date! 
Find the novel here: https://tapas.io/series/mating-season38

181,"Contest: draw the coolest medical worker, who’s fighting corona, and win 50.000 Ink!",Events | Challenges,[],"And here we are... COVID-19 raised the issue of heroes in real life8 again. Now we see how medics literary sacrifice their lives and sanity to fight the new infection all over the world.
It's trendy to call them ""heroes"" nowadays, but they are completely different from that kind of fictional ""heroes"", whom we see in typical Hollywood movies.

Typical superhero has fit body and well-groomed face of Hollywood star.Medics have no time to take care about their appearance right now, so many of them look awful.
Movie superheroes are righteous and kind.Many of medics can't keep themselves kind and empathetic to all patients; they seems to be too embittered and irritable from stress. Some have meltdowns, make hysterics and inevitable take it out on patients and other people, just because they can't handle it.
Movie superheroes are sturdy.Medics are vulnerable: they hurt their physical and mental health by overworking. Some commit suicide, unable to bear all this shit; some die from infection itself.
Movie superheroes have superpowers.Medics have the whole spectrum of human weaknesses and natural restrictions instead.
Movie superhero can save the world alone or with the small team.None of medics can. There are hundreds of thousands of them - and still, they're all overwhelmed with work, which they physically can't handle.

They are just real people. Not always beautiful, not always righteous and not always strong. But despite of all of this, they're doing job of key importance and are trying to help us as far as they can. And, from my personal opinion, it makes them even more cool. Not glossy cool, but truly, really cool.
A note: if you're disagree with any statements above, feel free to tell about it in heroes topic8, in watercooler1 or whatever else. But I kindly ask to to leave more space for entries, than discussions, in the current thread.

I suggest to draw a cool medical worker.
It can be made in serious tone, to convey all the hardships of medic's duty; but it also can be made in lighter tone, to lighten the mood instead. It can depict a real person (a note: in this case, ask for their permission or ensure in any other way that they'll not be against it, before drawing); but it also can be aggregated image of any kind instead.
The most important is to convey that med workers are cool and important, no matter what!
It's encouraged (but not necessary) to upload your entry in social media, where real med workers can see it and maybe (hopefully ) perceive like a kind of appreciation.

The rules
You should post a drawing of COOL MEDICAL WORKER(S) in this thread until UPD: 25 May, including.Requirements for entries:

Each drawing should, of course, be drawn by the person, who submits it.
A drawing shouldn't been uploaded in the internet previously.
Only one submission per person can participate in contest.

After this, I'll make a poll, where forum users will vote for the coolest med worker, during a week - from 26 to 2 May (including).The winner of the poll, chosen by the majority of forum users' votes, will receive 50.000 Ink. I'll also pick an additional winner by my own discretion, and they'll receive the second prize - 25.000 Ink.

P.S.
Sorry for being so sentimental today. I'll probably make a couple of cynical posts here and there and host a contest for drawing horrible things (again...) next time to compensate.

Contest: draw the craziest bootleg character and win 50.000 Ink! [CLOSED] Events


    (As I learned recently) bootleg character is illegal knockoff of well-known original character from popular anime/game/etc. Usually they are named similarly to original character, but in warped manner. Alternatively, they can combine the names (and/or features) of several different well-known personas:

They also often appear on smuggled merchandise of... questionable design and quality (which is the dominant purpose of their creation, as I suppose):

189,We apologize for the Spam,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey everyone, 
First and foremost, I want to apologize to everyone that's been recently impacted by the recent influx of bot accounts that have been relentlessly spamming creator and reader walls on the desktop version of Tapas. 
This has been an ongoing battle, and while we've introduced a myriad of preventative measures, the evolving sophistication of these spam bots has proven to be quite difficult to combat. 
They first appeared years ago, creating comic series (and more recently novel series) in hopes of creating higher SEO value to the source links, which boosts their search results and makes more people susceptible to their exploits. We added a few precautionary measures to help deter the frequency of these spam series being created, and for the most part, we've been able to dramatically reduce their ability to flood the fresh section which was negatively impacting a creator's ability to appear in that section. 
The spam accounts have more recently been targeting creator and reader walls, which is hurting the overall reader and creator experience - burying creator posts and flooding notifications so creators lose track of important comments left on their wall, series, or other notifications such as likes or new subscribes. 
We are working diligently on combating these spam accounts, and creating new ways to help suppress them. 
I'm sorry for anyone negatively impacted by these bots. 
I'll be keeping everyone updated in this thread. 
If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to tag me here and I'll be more than happy to help.

One of the restraints is doubling the overall number of items on the front page, and we would want to try and tackle this will a clean, aesthetically pleasing solution that isn't going to add too much business to the overall front page experience. So... basically, we want to add more stuff while reducing the amount of stuff which is a conundrum. \nI believe that there are (currently in the works) more effective solutions and opportunities to surfacing more novels on the app side then there are on the web. But I agree that separating out a trending or popular section specifically for novels makes a lot of sense especially because as is it might be a bit confusing since both have square thumbnails and isn't easily distinguishable from one another at face value. \n\n\nz3rohedgehog:\nUgh, but having the FRESH section buried puts pretty much everyone else who isn't on the front page at a disadvantage.

The only way to get noticed on this website is if you somehow make it onto the front page. Otherwise, the FRESH section is the only thing you have...\nI don't think there's a really good solution to this problem, and it is something that almost all large platforms struggle with. \nTry to think about it this way, the Fresh section is the most rapidly updated section on the site and app. If you look at the last visible page (5) right now, the last series to update was a little less than 5 hours ago, meaning that the window for exposure in the Fresh section is roughly 5 or 6 hours. Depending on the day, there could be more than 1,000 updates, reducing the window to 3 hours or less. While I understand that the Fresh section is an avenue where creators can be discovered, it's not entirely effective due to the those windows of exposure. \nWe purposefully created algorithms for trending section to reward engaging series (novels or comics) so if creators are actively promoting their work, or engaging with their readers, they'll have a much higher chance of being on the front page for an extended period of time which benefits them more. \nIf we were to surface Fresh beyond what is already there, and with the style of the trending, popular, or new and noteworthy section, the window for exposure would be minutes.\nHope that makes sense! \n\n\njoannekwan:\nA series gets on the trending page when it sees a lot of activity (comments, likes, views, etc.) at any given time interval (last I checked it was every 30 min) compared to every other series on the site. What constitutes 'a lot' is calculated by the ratio of activity to how many subscribers the series has.\nAbsolutely, and without giving away the secret formula, we try to weigh it to be as proportional as possible to give newer creators a shot. \n\nOkay this thread is kind of getting derailed from the original discussion and purpose, so I'll be only responding to questions pertaining to the spam bots moving forward. I'll try to have more open Q&As moving forward though and hope that this has been helpful for those interested! \nUpdate to the spam bots: We have banned several thousand spam accounts. However, there are some spam accounts that were subscribed to series. If you notice a significant drop, it may be due to this. It looks like the spam bots were automated to subscribe to series to be less suspicious."", ""If I ever find spambot posts on my wall, I'm going to scambait them. The entire point of using bots is time-efficiency. Wasting the  of scammers might discourage the targeting of this sight again, and it should feel satisfying.

192,Contest: draw the craziest bootleg character and win 50.000 Ink! [CLOSED],Events | Challenges,[],"(As I learned recently) bootleg character is illegal knockoff of well-known original character from popular anime/game/etc. Usually they are named similarly to original character, but in warped manner. Alternatively, they can combine the names (and/or features) of several different well-known personas:

They also often appear on smuggled merchandise of... questionable design and quality (which is the dominant purpose of their creation, as I suppose):

Now, what about unleashing your imagination and drawing your own bootleg character?!!
You can depict just the creature themselves or draw the (imaginary) merch with them - up to your choice.  The most important is: it should be as crazy as possible and blow people's minds!
P.S. Thanks @DiegoPalacios for the idea for this contest!  

The rules
You should post a drawing of THE CRAZIEST BOOTLEG OC you can imagine in this thread until (UPDATE: ) 8 April, including (instead of 5 April).Requirements for entries:

Each drawing should, of course, be drawn by the person, who submits it.
A drawing shouldn't been uploaded in the internet previously.
Only one submission per person can participate in contest.

After this, I'll make a poll, where forum users will vote for the craziest bootleg OC, during a week - from 9 to 15 April (including).The winner of the poll, chosen by the majority of forum users' votes, will receive 50.000 Ink. I'll also pick an additional winner, who's bootleg character I personally will find the craziest/funniest, and they'll receive the second prize - 25.000 Ink.","['Those recommended Pinterest pictures\n', ""This goes so against all my principles that I'm having a really hard time coming up with something.

I am an author helping out with programming at Ad Astra, Ontario's Science Fiction and Fantasy Literary Con. The convention takes place this May 1-3rd. 
I am putting together some comic and graphic novel panels and am looking for writers and artists to participate. If you participate on three panels, we include a free pass for the weekend and access to the green room, which is a private lounge for professionals to network, relax, and get food and drink. 
I have limited space, but if you're a Toronto or GTA based comic artist and/or writer and would like to share your work and experience with readers and fellow colleagues alike, please DM me. 
I hope I am posting this in the right spot and I'll do my best to answer any questions.

202,Contest: draw THE LEAST cute chibi and win 50.000 Tapas Ink,Events | Challenges,[],"They say chibis always are cute.They say they never saw NOT cute chibi.I myself was convinced that being cute is a destiny of every chibi as well... 
...but at one moment, I questioned myself: is there really no way for chibi to cheat their own destiny? Is there really no way for chibi to be NOT cute?!
Help me to find out the answer of this question! Draw the least cute chibi that only your imagination could create. Let's experiment and see how far you can go on this path! 

P.S. A small clarification, to be more precise: by ""chibi"" I mean a child-like super-deformed character with big head, big eyes, small body and short chunky limbs.

The rules

You should post a drawing of THE LEAST CUTE chibi you can imagine in this thread until 18 Feburary (including). (In previous drawings competition I gave a week, but considering the fact, that many people are busy with 14-Feburary-specials now, I decided to give additional time for participants this time  ).
Requirements for entries:A) Each drawing should, of course, be drawn by the person, who submits it.B) A drawing shouldn't been uploaded in the internet previously.C) Only one submission per person can participate in contest.
After this, I'll make a poll, where forum users will vote for the least cute chibi, during a week - from 19 to 26 Feburary.
The winner of the poll, chosen by the majority of forum users' votes, will receive 50.000 Ink from me.
I'll also pick an additional winner, who's chibi I personally will find the least cute, and they'll receive the second prize - 25.000 Ink.

203,VOTING: Tapas Indie Comics Veterans Competition (250.000 Ink main prize),Events | Challenges,[],"At this thread18 I announced a competitions for Tapas veterans comics makers. After this, I received a lot of submissions - 36.

The first stage of evaluation was a preliminary selection by a jury. We read and evaluated all submitted entries, and choose top 5 comics, which passed to the next stage.
Now it's time for a second stage: open community voting among top-5 comics, picked by a jury!

 Celestial Chronicle Shion: https://tapas.io/series/shion
 dreamDB: https://tapas.io/series/dreamDB
 Smith: https://tapas.io/series/Smith
 Aegis: https://tapas.io/series/Aegis1

49votersVotes are public.Show results
If you want to vote, then, please, read at least a part from each comics from the list and try to decide, which one will win the prize, thoughtfully. 
Brief info about jury's work
 Besides me, jury consisted from those nice people: @Azifri , @BlueDragon , @writercynknapp , @jensrichard77 , @Rhonder , @skicoak , @TAMAnnoying .
Jury evaluated every comics by the following parameters:

GENERAL ART QUALITY/ SKILL
THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT INTO DETAILS AND POLISHING ART (includes quality of shading, line art, backgrounds)
WRITING QUALITY
STORYTELLING QUALITY
USING OF COMICS FORMAT (paneling/use of the page/space)

and summarized the results in one final mark for each comics. Top-5 comics with the highest marks passed to the second stage.
A note:
I know, that the marks and process are arguable. But we had to come up with something more-or-less objective, and this is what we came up with. Also take into account, that for me, as an organizer, it was the first experience in organizing any competition; for some jury members this all was very new, too. We did really large amount of work for free to evaluate all these comics, to the best of our ability.
Why preliminary selection was needed?
Because there were a lot of entries, and it was obvious, that average forum reader will not be able to take a look on every comics from such a big list. That's why I called for those people, who were prepared to read a big amount of comics, they became a jury members and made all that big preliminary work, to narrow the amount of candidates.However, I think, that it's realistic for average forum member to check ( not necessary read entirely, but, at least, take a look at ) 5 comics instead of 36, that's why top-5 were put into the open voting.
Info for all participants (i.e. for all people, who submitted their comics to the competition):
I want everyone to extract something useful from this competition, even if you didn't pass for the second stage. So, everyone who submitted their comics, can ask for:

a small feedback /critique (text, consisting from 3-4 paragraphs from each jury member, who read the comics);
their marks (numbers) for each parameter.

So if you want, you can learn something from it. Just PM me or other jury members to make such a request.


UPD: I think, 2 weeks will be enough for everyone who wanted to vote, so, poll will be closed 13 February. And in Valentine's day we'll know a winner!

208,Tapas Indie Comics Veterans Competition (250.000 Ink main prize),Events | Challenges,[],"I respect people, who've already had a long journey with their comics, and still continue to do it, even if they don't have too many subs. Thus, I decided to make a contest for all underestimated (but still impassioned!) veterans of Tapas.Submissions are open for the next two weeks (until 19 January).
Requirements for submissions

Your comics is hosted on Tapas (It may have mirrors on other hosting as well, but we will evaluate and award Tapas version)
a) It's first issue (on Tapas) is dated by 2018 year or earlier.b) It has 5 or more issues.c) The last issue is made not earlier than 3 months ago (i.e. relatively not long ago).
a) It has at least 1 (one) subscriber, 1 like and 1 comment ( or more  ).b) In the same time it has less than 1000 (one thousand) subscribers.
(UPD): Comics should be written in English.

Justification of chosen requirements

It is for everyone's convenience and unification. Besides, default method of awarding is Tapas Ink. (other methods for people who don't have support button will be considered later).
It means that you are passionate enough to:a) Draw and upload it here for 1 year or more;b) Update it consequently for long enough;c) Not abandon it.
a) It means that someone really reads it and reacts on it (of course, likes/comments from your own (creator's) account don't count).b) Because I want to encourage small creators at the first place.
All members of jury should be able to read and understand it.


Besides, you should have a google account (it's needed for avoiding problems with spam and multiple submissions).

Submission form


docs.google.com44



Unofficial Tapas Indie Comics Contest Submission
This Form is private






Additional notes

The first round will be an elimination round. According to my plan, jury will choose which comics will pass to the next round (not more than 10).
Volunteers for jury are required. If you want to be a volunteer, please, PM me. After submission end, jury will discuss criteria for voting (because I dunno and I need a help with it).
You can submit your comics AND be a part of jury in the same time (why not?). But you'll not be able to vote for your own comics. 

Jury members will gain encouraging prize of 1000 (one thousand) Ink per person. (but not more than 100 persons)
Posting the information of this comics on your Tapas page or everywhere else is strongly encouraged!



P.S. I'm organizing such a competition for the first time in my life. Thus, I have no idea how to do it,  how will it go, and there is no guarantees that it will work well.P.P.S.

212,2019 Tapas Secret Santa Signups!,Events | Challenges,[],"Secret Santa Sign-up Link53
Sign-up Deadline: November 22nd
Sign-ups Rollout: November 24th

Time for signups \o/ For those who don't know, my name JJ, I have a forever hiatus comic7, and I run the Secret Santa on Tapas every year.   In the secret santa, everyone who participates gets to draw each other's OC's and get to see them posted on the main site here41.
Note: We're still going to include writers this year but depending on how many sign up, we have to consider if it's worth including writing in future events (there have typically been low turnout of writers who make short stories)
Previous Secret Santas: 201830 | 20172 | 20161 | 20155

Rules
You will be assigned to someone's comic or novel at random and have until the deadline to draw the character(s) your assignee requests in the theme they want. If they give no special requests, it's up to your creativity.
For comic artists, you will be making an illustration; fanart in your own unique style. It should be a coloured piece unless your unique style (or your assignee's) is black and white.
For novelists, you will have until the deadline to write a short story about their character(s). Ideally, at least a ten page chapter that illustrates what your assignee requests but this isn't a strict requirement. If they make no specific requests, it's up to your creativity to bring their characters to life through writing. (note: there's no strictness on the length of your short story)
You cannot choose whether you will receive a illustration or a short story for your gift. This should minimise chaos and still allow everyone to be included. Do keep in mind though, most people will receive an illustration anyway since the majority of participants tend to be comic artists.
Requirements

You must sign up through the Google forms link in order to be added to the participants list.
You must have a novel or comic on Tapas with at least one chapter that includes the character/characters you want in the Secret Santa
If you try to sign up with an OC that does not meet the above requirements, you will not be included in the participants list.

Comic Artists
You must have at least one full body, coloured reference of your characterIt doesn't have to be ""good."" Just needs colour so we know what they look like!

Novelists
You must provide a (drawn or written) physical description of your character or characters. If you have a unique setting you want your character to be in, make sure to describe this as well.This can be provided through links to specific pages or writing a custom description on the sign-up sheet

Everyone

In the sign up, name any special requests
In the sign up, specify your willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and draw two secret santas?)
After the sign up deadline has passed, you will receive a participant number and everyone will be given a Secret Santa at random.
A deadline will be given to encourage completion by Christmas

Important: When you complete your piece, email it to me at this address22. Your email title should include ""Secret Santa"" and your participant number or name. Comic artists can email in any picture format. Novelists must emai their file as a Word document or PDF file.



Rules on dropping out
Let's be honest; this has been an issue since the Secret Santas started. Sometimes life gets in the way and you can't work on your art, sometimes an emergency comes up, and sometimes you just don't want to do it anymore. This concern has been brought to me a few times so I'm going to add a few rules pertaining to dropping out.

If you need to drop out, for whatever reason, please send me a message on Tapas (or by email) 10 days prior to the deadline. This is to give volunteers time to make a second secret santa
If you fail to notify me ahead of time or just disappear, your story will not be spotlighted in the Secret Santa and you may not be able to sign up for future events.
If you think you may not be able to commit or may not be motivated to finish your piece, then I do not recommend signing up. I remember the chaos moments when people disappeared after the deadline (me included...). It is a great inconvenience to people and as much as I'd love everyone to participate, I shouldn't chance it either.

Note: I'm not participating this year for this very reason.I'm always here as a last second volunteer though. Point is: know your limits.

Other Comments
I really encourage you read at least a little of your assignee's work. This can help you gain a better idea of their characters, if not introduce you to a new story to follow.

Name:  KRWilliams2Novel:  Freedom's Pyre1Character(s): Kit and ShinReferences:  Comments:Kit is shorter than Shin by about a head in height. He is black, though with straight hair (think Somalian/North African descent) and mixed race. Scrawny too. Shin is taller, muscular and Far-East Asian/Japanese. It's a fantasy world set in the colonial era (British regency) and they're both in the army. For sake of ease - and to save drawing military uniforms and complex clothes - it's possible to just put them in white collared shirts with no buttons and trousers and boots.Requests: I'm totally open to whatever the artist wants. One thing is that Shin is meant to be a fairly easy-going guy, and Kit is exceptionally intense. Also Shin is far more into Kit than Kit is into him for most of the story. (They eventually are lovers, but it takes like 150k words to get that far so....)Volunteer: YL

He has the tendency to dress in multiple layers of elaborately colored clothing such as scarves, tunics, and sashes. He's cocky at times but appears subdued to most. A pretty boy but is also very clearly a young man growing into something handsome and regal.Comments: I'm a novelist, but I will be drawing my gift.Requests: It'd be cool to see water incorporated in some kind of way.

216,Azure Ink Character Contest ($50 prize),Events | Challenges,[],"
Cover.jpg1575x2475 541 KB

Okay so... @Yumestar was trying to get me to sponsor a contest for a novel she's helping me edit.
She was all like 'You should do a character contest!' and I was doing my best to try and weasel out of it. If this post goes live it means I completely failed and we're doing the contest.
So here's the deal, I'm gonna put up $50 of my own money to the person who can do... something with their favorite Azure Ink Character.
(Azure Ink is a Yuri Yakuza Novel I finished a little while ago)
Could be whatever you feel best fits the character. I'll judge the entries and pick a winner in... lets give everyone say two weeks December 7th at 12pm EST?
You can forward any submissions to Raspbryl@gmail.com and post them here if you like.
How does that sound?...This was not my idea I swear.(If I messed it up... I'm sorry)

Azure Ink | Tapas
Chromatic Imperium Vol. 0.5
[Yakuza/Yuri/GL/Crime/Romance]

Kairi is an aspiring pilot living in a particularly crime ridden province near Tokyo. Can she touch the sky beyond or will she be consumed by the filth on the ground?





","['Bumping this up, Rasp is a great person to work with ^^', ""@Yumestar I don't think this is working... maybe we should try something else?"", ""You can try posting this on Deviantart as well. I see these kinds of contests get pretty popular, if you advertise it right. Since it's a novel, you're also more likely to get participants if you have some additional visual references to help the artists. Good luck "", 'Yume has a few rough sketches but maybe its time to commission some Team Photos\nHey if anyone wants to send me prices and save me the trouble of searching for an artist go right ahead.', ""I wouldn't give up so soon. A lot of people tend to send in submissions much closer to the actual deadline. Good luck with your contest~!"", 'I suppose I was just hoping it would get a bit more attention than it did. I mean if nobody reads the book they cant exactly enter the contest...', ""That's kind of the unfortunate reality. I tried to run a contest years ago for a story I was writing, really pushed it, got a lot of attention, even got it featured elsewhere, but zero entries. People just don't want to read to enter something.  That's why I mentioned having visual aids if you want to entice people. And if you're wanting specific scenes or have some ideas, you can write down a paragraph or so of the characters' personalities, relationships, etc.\nI'm sure there are ways of running contests for books to draw scenes/characters, but I think that tends to happen more when the book is already popular, rather than in an attempt to make it popular. It also depends on how you present it, no doubt.\nNevertheless, I hope you get some interest."", ""That was more or less the same reservation I had at the start of all this. I've run out of promotion ideas. I spent so much time on this book but being a disabled hermit I'm not terribly social so I'm kind of awful at building an audience. I was sort of hoping this would give enough people the incentive to give it a chance at least. I mean its a completed full length novel I put months into and having virtually no comments is rather disheartening.\nI suppose next month I can have some more promotional artwork done."", ""How many websites do you post it on? Have you tried Wattpad? Promotional artwork might help, I've seen lots of authors have character portraits done. \nMaybe after you get some art done, you can spice up the contest a bit more? Maybe some banner graphics, a wider range of prizes. First place could have a printed copy along with the money, for example.\nIf you do have an ebook version, I've seen authors do giveaways on Twitter. And if you have a place for reviews, like GoodReads, Amazon, etc., could also be another outlet for people to go.\nBest of luck!"", ""Don't give up so soon! I'll check your story out and see if I have time to enter! I love GL anyways  Good luck!"", ""That sounds like it would really be expensive. I don't make any money off my work and I'm on a fixed income. I suppose it would be good to do a larger contest after editing finishes. Unfortunately some of the later chapters still need a little refining but form what @Yumestar has told me they are in pretty good shape from what she's read.\nPart of this is getting a final round of feedback before I make my final edit and submit it for publishing. I don't mean to sound arrogant this is my first full length novel but I feel with a bit more work it might be worthy of an amazon release. I've certainly seen worse on there."", ""If this is more about getting feedback for editing purposes, then I'd look into beta readers rather than do a contest. You'd definitely get more bites that way. Asking family and friends is a start, but if you're looking for more people, I'd check out Deviantart forums, writing forums/groups, Nanowrimo resources/forum, and maybe even local Meetup writing groups in your area for more people. All of which would be free, at the cost of your time.\nIf you are going that route, I'd offer people PDF copies and not just links to your Tapas. It looks more professional that way and might be easier for them to read through, without the site distracting them or feeling like they need an account.\nHopefully you can find some interest. If I wasn't so scrapped for time myself, I'd offer. I can sub now though and maybe get time in the future. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter (same username) if you're still looking some time next year "", ""I've attempted to get beta readers, hell I tried hiring beta readers but no dice. I don't know how people find beta readers so easily because I've been trying desperately and it hasn't been working. There is a google doc I've been using to try and collect feedback but I'm a bit uncomfortable sharing that publicly.\nThis was the backup plan when the original get beta reader plan horribly and repeatedly failed."", ""I've typically sought out mostly friends in the past for mine. Though before I moved to California, I had a really good writing group I found on Meetup that was local that was great for helping too. I'd check to see if your area is on their website and if there are any groups nearby.\nAs an additional resource, I'd check out this channel for ideas: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_fcv9kBpDN4WWrfcbCrgw/videos (though be warned, she does swear a lot and is often blunt)\nGoodReads should have some beta groups on there. A quick search brought up this one, which looks active: https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/50920-beta-reader-group Though no doubt there are others.\nYou might also be able to do trades with other authors looking for betas. You beta theirs and they beta yours.\nThe thing with betas is that you'll want several going at once, since some of them will drop off at some point in the process. So don't feel bad if you have your book out with 5-10+ people at one time. (As in, don't just stop once you get one person interested in beta reading. Keep asking around, jic.)\nI get that it's frustrating though. My most recent book I'm working on has had basically all of my betas drop for various reasons. Finding new ones can be tough, but hopefully you can get some. <3"", ""Local area is a no-go because of my disability and I would not be comfortable showing off a GL book in the south. I did go to what few friends I have but that was a dead end. While I'm a good writer I've got a condition that makes reading for long periods difficult, I have to listen to audiobooks so a trade is going to be hard to do."", ""I'd definitely check out that GoodReads group then, seems like a good next move "", ""Well you don't even need to read that far into Azure Ink to get a grasp of the main cast really :o I sort of liked how novels don't outright give you a visual character design so artists like myself can take liberties to add their own creative input"", ""Hm that is true I do like seeing where other people take the characters I create and having something to look at really helps a character come into focus for me. It seems to make my characters more real... at least to me. By all means take liberties if you're thinking of doing some artwork."", ""bumping this again, Hopefully it's less busy now""]",11/23/2019 19:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If your drawing skills are just average, you will still have the chance to become one of the winners by drawing something funny, clever or innovative. Of course your artwork must reference Sandra and Woo or Gaia in some way. You can submit any type of art such as drawings, comics, 3D models, animations, games, poems, ..., or photos of action figures and cosplay costumes. There is one exception: fanfiction, i.e. prose in the style of a novel, cannot be submitted this time. The high prize money may lead to submissions with the length of a full novel and I just don’t have the time to read all of that.

Comic info and character references
You can find a short description of the comics, including the best pages and a rough timeline of the events in Gaia on the following page:Info about the comics30You can find information and reference pics for all characters appearing in Sandra and Woo and Gaia on the following page:

How to submit your entry
Please send your entry in an e-mail with the subject “Artwork contest 2019” to novil@gmx.de. You can attach the file to the e-mail or put a link to it in the e-mail’s text body. You must submit your entry until (including) Friday, 18 October 2019. Please use the following template for the content of your e-mail:

Artist: YOUR_NAME (as it should appear on this website)
PayPal: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME (other payment methods can be discussed, can also be provided after the contest)
Website: YOUR_WEBSITE (optional)
Description: DESCRIPTION_OF_YOUR_ENTRY (optional)

I will put your name, website and description (in shortened form) below the thumbnail of your submission when publishing all received submissions in multiple blog posts.
How to improve your chances of winning / Image quality
The technical quality of the image file is very important to me! Digital images should be sent in their original size in a lossless image format, typically PNG with full color depth. If you draw the image on paper, you should send me a large, clean scan of it in a lossless image format. You can send me files up to a file size of 100 MB by e-mail.
I cannot stress this requirement enough since I constantly received submissions in the past years that did not meet these standards:
I do not want JPEGs!
I want the images in their original size!
Photos of physical objects
If you submit a photo of a physical object, make sure that the photo is of the highest quality. This means your photo should have the following qualities:
The object is perfectly staged.
The lighting conditions are optimal.
The photo is therefore sharp.
The photo has a large total size.
The photo has minimal image compression artifacts.
It’s also a good idea to take multiple photos from different angles. But make sure that there is one photo that gives a particularly good overview of the object.

Inclusion in art books and comic anthologies
If I decide to use your piece of art in an upcoming art book, like the recently published The Art of Sandra and Woo, or a comic anthology, like the upcoming The Complete Gaia, you will receive an additional compensation of $10 + (artwork size / printable page size) * $20. That means if your drawing covers a whole page, you will get $30 after the successful publication of the book.
Additional information
You can submit several drawings or other types of art, but you can win at most two prizes.
Please do not publish your artwork on other websites before the end of the contest. After that, you’re encouraged to post it anywhere you want.
You can sign your work. But a large, ugly watermark will reduce your chance of winning.

219,Inksgiving 2019 - Giving and Receiving Master List,Events | Challenges,[],"This is not an official one but I've made the same thread last summer, so I thought I made one again as no-one has done it yet.
I see that there's many new people in the forum that I don't recognize as I've been away and just popin in for a minute or so everytime lol.
If you haven't unlocked your support yet, you can do so even though you haven't reach the requirements by emailing @/michaelson on the time of Inksgiving to get them unlocked! Ｏ(≧▽≦)Ｏ
I don't know if you can do it right now but they'll do it when Inksgiving and Spring giving is on the run.
Anyway.
So this is going to be a list of peoples who want to give and receive inks for Inksgiving 2019. 
If you have a plan or contest for the event, post here!
If you just want to get some inks on the way from other generous people, post here!
If you simply want to share your inks (and flex your wealth), look on the list and post  your series here too because you all deserve it! 
The only rule is to post the least subscribed series of your work, either comic or novel, and NOT the episode link.
I can't really say I'll be participating because I'm low on inks (and I still haven't get back to last spring giving people who's throwing their inks to me as it is kinda impossible now since I don't even remember who's haven't got it QxQ), so I probably only able to throw 25 per person. 
ah... The perks of being broke... My commission can't even save me... Cri on the corner...
Anyway, here's mine.

Hey hi hello~! 
We're very excited to announce preparations for our next Inksgiving Event which will take place from November 22nd (12:00 am pst) to November 24th (11:59 pm pst)!

2160_1080_[inksgiving101]_2019.jpg2160x1080 551 KB

For those new to Inksgiving, it’s a community driven event where readers and creators are encouraged to Support one another through the gifting of Ink. There will also be community milestones that when met, unlocks portions of the gifted Ink to be rewarded back. This year, the milestones and rewards will start at 10 million Ink, go to 15 million Ink, and end at 20 million Ink. 
Leading up to the event, we'll be posting a number of articles to help creators make the most out of their Inksgiving experience. We'll be sharing those over on our Newsfeed (https://tapas.io/newsfeed/69) as well as creating new notifications on your creator dashboard (https://tapas.io/dashboard/index26). 
We'll also be hosting a number of giveaways including physical merch and free Ink on our social media channels so be sure to give those a follow to keep updated (https://www.instagram.com/tapas_app/27), as well as random events right here on the forums. 
We want to make sure that every creator interested in the event will have an opportunity to participate. For those that do not meet the minimum subscriber requirement needed in order to activate Support, please feel free to email me at michaelson@tapasmedia.co. Starting this Friday, I'll be manually activating Support twice a week up until the end of the event (Mondays and Fridays)**. 
We'll also be sending out a Creator Newsletter in the coming weeks filled with new updates, creator-related news, and more! So keep an eye out for that. 
Happy reading, -Tapas Staff

An author who loves making histories and worldbuilding much harder than anyone on Tapas (I think).
I have a lot of things in my mind, consider I am a bit close to the limit of my preserved pages, I am feeling very worried and  I need to limit the number of pages monthly.
It saddens me but for the sake of saving my pages and continue my comic without reaching the limit, I have to post only three pages a month.
Since I have to balance this out, I will have no choice but to prepare the next page on 20th November and the next one at the end of November and by next month, I will continue to update every 10 days and so on, so on and so on.

But i will write, I will tell my fantasy story.Over a long time, I will be working on the same story and build very good worldbuilding, I have now found a co-writer to take the story to a professional story and also an Artist to come with beautiful pictures to this novel.So we are many to share your Support.Link to my profile:

Please check out the full announcement in the Newsfeed267 for details!

252,Got a Tipping Comic? Share here!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi everyone! 
January has come to an end and with that our first full month of tipping. We launched the feature at the end of December with 20 creators, and are now up to 700 creators with the feature active. I'd like to thank each and every one of you that have played a part in making this feature such a success. The generosity from fans and creators has been a tremendously uplifting sight to see, especially when held in contrast to some of the more recent things happening in the world. 
I've personally activated all 700 accounts and am working hard to try to activate 700 more in February, which is, unfortunately, a lot less than the 50 per day that I had originally projected. But that's okay! One of the absolute highlights of this feature has been talking to so many of you one on one and catching up with some creators that launched their series when I first started working for Tapas Media (shoutout to Wavechan!). 
As you might have noticed, tipping directly on the Daily Snack has been a really great way to expose tipping to people on a daily basis. We usually pair a regular episode from a series alongside their tipping episode. 
If you have made a tipping episode please do link to it in the posts below and let me know if you're okay with us using some of the art within the episode to create internal ads for the Tapastic community. You might have noticed that there's been an ad with art by Kales (https://tapastic.com/kalidewild) popping up every now and then. If you're not okay with us using your art for these purposes, I completely understand. 
So, in the posts below please do the following:
1) Link to your tipping episode2) State whether you're okay with us using the art for advertisements3) Include any feedback you might have for tipping 
Thanks again, and happy tipping. -Michael","['Hey Micheal! I think you may have seen it already, but I did my own tipping episode a couple weeks ago!https://tapastic.com/episode/559908185Feel free to use it in anyway if you have any use for it!

Felt good to see that money in my paypal again! \nAs for feedback, I think a handful of people have already said it and I think we talked about it a couple weeks ago, but it\'d be fantastic to see maybe at what point people tipped. I know there is a ""by date"" tab, but there\'s not really any dates attached to it and it only shows their total that they\'ve tipped over a period of time. I\'d really love to do stuff like raffles, where I can say ""Everyone who tips after this episode will be entered,"" but currently I have no way to tell when they specifically tipped.', ""Hi,1.

About the bonus coin system: Couldn't there be like 2 different balances?  One for bonus coins and one for earned/bought coins? That way, people would be able to know exactly how much of each they've got and the confusion would be slightly less? I noticed it yesterday that I had 225 bonus coins, but I could only tip with 600, even though the balance were at 1102. (I figured that the other part must've been either a bug or bonus coins that hadn't left the account yet).That way you can still have the bonus coins AND the earned/bought coins (if that's possible).

I think a dollar package would be great for those who want to tip but really don't have much money.Also, allowing tipping on the desktop would be great, as I use it more than the app.  I know I've read that it's more difficult, but I think it would boost the tipping economy even more!"", ""Yes! Right here8!

Please check all of these guys out! Their pitches were too awesome and we know a lot of them already, and their main comics or novels are simply amazing!!
If this anthology goes well, we'll most likely go for a bigger book next time, sadly this time we had to keep to a very limited page count.
Keep your eyes out for the kickstarter, all the artists will be paid by how well it goes, besides their main income for this, as well as receiving royalties for every book sold!
Thank you all again for the response to this project, it really turned into so much more than we had imagined!

278,BLIND DATE WITH AN UNDER 500 SUB COMIC (Gifting Ink),Events | Challenges,[],"What is this?Awhile ago, @dailysketchartist started a thread like this for comics under 250. Since all good things must come to an end, so did her event, but I thought it could be really nice to redo it, this time for comics with a bit more subs. 
I’ll be following daily’s format: I'll be posting 3 comics here periodically as a link only. Why link only?
""Don't judge a book by its cover"". Let's be honest here, we probably all judge books by their covers, which is why I decided to make this thread. A place for a Blind Date between you, the reader, and the comics listed below!
How do I do this?Leave a comment in the comic and I’ll send you 25 ink per comic! This will be per-round.
I won’t be testing you to see if you’ve actually read the comic, but please try and do so! After all, it’s why we’re here. Please do not comment something like “I’m only here for ink”, for the sake of the creators, that just sucks. 
Only your first comment per comic per promotion will count, but feel free to leave more comments!
When you're done, Just PM me the Comic and Episode number where you left the comment so that I can validate it. After validation, I will send the Ink. 
How do I nominate my/someone else’s comic? PM me with a link to the comic! At the moment, I’ll be going off my own bookmarks, mixed with comics from creators in the forums. I very much want to let as many people join as possible, so please don’t hesitate. I’ll probably even drop my own comic in the mix at some point.
I’d like to help you with the burden of the ink, Sending me ink will not help with this!! Since Tapas (sadly) doesn’t allow maintaining the ink as ink and automatically transfers it into cash with a fairly big difference. If you want to help I would super appriciate it!

This is why I'm doing this contest! Anyone can participate and you can give as many ideas as you want! 
I'm going to choose my favorite idea and the winner will have the chance to be the inventor in the comic ! I'm going to contact the winner and we will talk about if they want to use their persona or one of their ocs, and I'm going to design them in my style. The inventor will be everywhere in the comic. In magazine, on TV, on Billboard, etc... They will also be an important character  
I will also credit and link to the winner comic or social media when the character appears!
Good luck!!

282,Ink spill? (A giving event),Events | Challenges,[],"This is a very sudden not fully thought out idea so mostly just trying to see if there would be interest.
Inspired by Twitch raiding, I think it would be a fun idea to get folks together to ""Ink Spill"" a creator with a low subscriber number or who is going through a tough time financially. 
People could suggest creators (not themselves) who we could all throw some ink at? Not sure if there would need to certain criteria for this.

‘Tis the season for Inksgiving! - Tapas
‘Tis the season for Inksgiving!❤️ Inksgiving is going to be a 48-hour event dedicated to giving love & support to your favorite creators that will take place this Nov 20th & Nov 21st! So mark your calendars!





Inksgiving will officially come to a close at 12:00AM PST/PDT tonight and we're quickly approaching our 15 million ink drop goal. 
So! With that being said, I'll be giving out a couple of prizes to those that can come closest to guessing the final ink count tallied up at midnight. 
Please be as specific about the ink count as possible to make things easier on my end (i.e. 15,320,231 or 28,039,398). 
The top 2 closest guesses will receive Tapas T-Shirts which are typically only given to staff members, and the next 3 closest guesses will receive a postcard signed by a few of the staff members (some of us, have really bad handwriting so this should be extra fun). Again, this is meant to be relatively lowkey and fun. 
Please lock in your guesses prior to midnight!
Oh! And Happy Holidays 
LOL! And guesses after 11:00pm pst/pdt won't count. sorry!

Hello, Tapas Community!Welcome to the Chinese/Lunar New Year Collaboration! I recently joined the forums after releasing my first comic1 in November and I look forward to meeting you all!
This is a project where you will make promotional art/work, comment, and gift + receive ink!
Participants will be creating their own New Year Promotional art/work for the Year of the Pig and posting it within the 15 days (according to Wikipedia) of the New Year, which starts on February 5 this year.
You can participate even if you don't normally celebrate Chinese/Lunar New Year. Use this as another opportunity to promote your work!

PROPOSAL

Create New Year promotional art/work, wishing your readers a Happy Chinese/Lunar New Year. It would be best if you include blessings such as wishing everyone good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity, etc. ~Wikipedia
(Optional) Make a smaller cross-promotion version and cross-promote with each other!Ex) Happy Chinese/Lunar New Year! ~Otaku-sama
Schedule/post your update (starting Feb.5) and send me the link to your update. I will be listing all entries sent to me here to make it easier for everyone to comment their New Year's Blessings to you.
Send your New Year's Blessings to each other by commenting on each other's post within the 15 Days of the Lunar New Year! This can be a copy/paste message.
(Optional) Gift a small red packet of ink (25-100 ink) to anyone who sends you New Year's Blessings! This isn't mandatory, but rather a kind gesture for sharing luck in the New Year.** I don't have Support unlocked yet, but I'll still be commenting and gifting ink!

Thanks for reading this!

285,Writers Camp 3rd Edition - Winners Announcement!,Events | Challenges,[],"Thank you so much to everyone who participated in our NaNoWriMo x Writer’s Camp! This time, 152 authors participated, and 32 people even hit the 50,000-word goal! Incredible! We’re so proud of everyone who participated in challenging themselves, writing something new, and persevering through NaNoWriMo and beyond!
The full collection of entries can be viewed here.18 You can also check out Violin’s fansite http://tapasfans.com/12, which she created out of her own passion for our creators!
Without further ado, we're excited to announce the winners:
Community’s Picks: The Accidental Prince14 by KR Williams and Nobody Loves the Bassist10 by NovelistOrange!
Editor’s Choice Prize: Diaries17 by J.E. Sexton!
Since there were so many amazing entries, it was hard to pick only a few winners! Here are our runners-up that we feel deserved some extra recognition: 
Runners-up: Prince of Mayhem5 by N.A. Carson, The Taking Season4 by Weslie, The God of Love is a Deadbeat4 by Lena, Mariposas6 by ChuvaWrites, and Dual8 by Winter Penwell!
Please check out our Newsfeed post30 to read more about the winners!
*Winners have been updated in light of recent discoveries, due to violation of the contest guidelines5.","[""So it was okay to share the books in other platforms like wattpad during the contest as long as there wasn't sex involved? https://www.wattpad.com/644020575-growing-pangs-chapter-one27  i am terribly dissapointed on tapas"", ""I'd be way more excited if one of the winners hadn't been posting the story on wattpad during the contest period  I was told I wasn't even allowed to post privately to Patreon for my paid subscribers so that's a huge bummer.\nGrats to the winners, though, I was excited to see some of those hardworking writers winning those top spots!"", 'Lol. Why is there always controversy with these contests.?', ""Before things get heated here, I would like to say that if there errors on Tapas part, I am confident that they will fix them. \nI completely understand why some people may be upset but encourage everyone to keep their cool and be patient. We likely don't have all the information, which makes it's easy to make assumptions that way, and it can be counterproductive."", ""Congrats to the winners!  I'm glad I entered."", ""Hello everyone, \nThanks for bringing this to our attention. \nWe'll be deliberating on a more formal announcement later, but in the meantime, we'll be withdrawing the community pick and prize awarded to Growing Pangs, as its publication on Wattpad breaches the rules for Writer's Camp. We'll also be taking time to reflect on our editorial processes and management for the selection of winners, investigating on why more due diligence wasn't performed during this time. \nWe apologize for this mistake and will be working towards making this right. \nThanks to all of those that participated in Writers Camp, and we hope to do better next time. \n-Michael"", 'Congratulations to all the winners, and good job to all the writers who did the very best they could ^^', 'Congratulations for all the winner~ ~(≧▽≦)/~~', 'Congrats to all the winners!

Or is it just one after all?"", 'I guess we’ll just have to wait. But my guess is that another community prize winner will be chosen. Prince of Mayhem would be my guess, since it is one of the Runner ups and ranks 3rd in subs.', 'Oof, having to take back a winner announcement must suck for all parties. Regardless, congratulations to all the winners and runner-ups! They all deserve it! I found a lot of really good stories because of deciding to post my NaNoWriMo writing here and this contest specifically, so I definitely appreciate all the work put in from both staff and community members ', 'Thank you to Tapas for running the contest! I hope the issues with the other novel get sorted and resolved quickly!\nWell done to everyone both on the list and off it! You all did awesome! (Also I love Diaries so I’m so happy it got ED pick!).', ""Congrats to all the legitimate winner, special KR, that really was on the race from the start and it was really one of the true fan favourites, and my sympathies to all the writers who poured their love and time into their beautifully crafted books to only see them scrapped at the last minute just because tapas decided to fall in line with the puritan guidelines of the Apple store, which makes economic sense and it is understandable, I just wish they were transparent about it from the start so everyone knew the REAL rules of the game and could have planned their stories accordingly, but this lack of transparency is certainly unforgivable, when even their premium content not always falls on their grey 'guidelines' area"", ""So I assume that Violin's site isn't finished? Because it says there are 98 entries but by my count there are 134 and my own entry is among the 36 not on the list."", ""I'm truly grateful that Mariposas was considered at all. Regardless of the controversy, which I've gathered is a little tradition at this point, I don't regret the effort I put in or the support I received. I'm happy to have participated with my noisy-seniors-learn-to-be-friends-through-the-power-of-awkward plotline.\nHere's hoping (a small desire of mine, really) there will be more editor picks. There are writers holding so much potential that participated during this competition that I wish we could all see. Three (but not all) of my personal favorites:\nAll in1 by HopCropA Flying Töskr2 by @faeriesandentsThe Butterflies Blossom2 by Armel Oenn (I admit I was checking out the butterfly competition on this one.)\nCongratulations to the head winners! And sidenote: Horror, science fiction, and mystery writers. I see you, and I love you."", ""You're a darling, Chuva dear :3 I really wished Mariposas would be amongst the winners, you are such a talented and hard-working writer! The feels man, the feels!"", ""@brooke@Michaelson@STAFFHi staff of Tapas! As you all probably know, I really love this site and its beautiful community and the contests are a great opportunity! Not only for lesser known authors to gain a following, but also for the wonderful cash prize, and, more importantly the opportunity to work with an editor to get their stories polished and uploaded into the premium section! It's like making someone's dream come true! \nThat being said, I have put together some suggestions and criticisms from myself and from some of the other entrants concerning the way the contests have been run in the hopes that you can make the camp a more pleasant and enchanting experience in the future.1.\tTapas should make genre contests from now on. I think almost all of the most subbed entries were BL, so, I think this would even things out in the future either just by Tapas doing a BL genre contest, or other genre contests.\n\nThe community pick should be the actual community pick. Rather than having the entries with the most subs win, Tapas should actually require a vote to be turned in to the admins for readers to support their favorite story. I think this would make things fairer because the people voting would be people who have a real passion for the story they supported rather than letting someone who probably has a lot of subs who might not even be reading their story win.\nPeople entering probably should not be able to promote on other sites where they already have humongous fanbases that they are entering the contest. As an extra caveat, maybe Tapas should only let people who have like… Under 1000 subs enter. Exposure contest anyone? \nThere should always be more staff-picks than community picks or at least an equal amount of both.\nJust so all the entrants get a little something extra for entering, Tapas should promote the contest like crazy! You should probably make that big ol’ banner that is front and center on the homepage a banner for the contest! This would really help everyone gain a following and let everyone know that there is a contest running! Along with that, you should also consistently leave a little message in everyone’s inbox that the contest is going on! And while the contest is running, I was even thinking that you should replace the novel staff-picks with entries from the contest each week and rotate them so every story has a chance in the sun! It makes a little more sense than leaving the same staff-picks up for months.\nTapas needs to be way better organized. Like, way, way better organized. You need to check to make sure some of these stories are not up on other websites before you let them enter. This isn’t asking much; my sister runs contest at her Disney Club at Deviantart where hundreds of people enter and she has a similar rule where the piece of art entered in the contest must be made for the contest, and after the date she got the journal up. She is literally ONE person and she takes the time to check and make sure no one is cheating.\nTapas should let their entrants know how they read their stories. I believe the best in Tapas, but I really do want some kind of proof the admins are actually reading every single entry and more importantly, how they are reading them. If they are only reading the first ten chapters, I want to know about it! An easy fix to this would either be to limit the number of people who can enter to give each entry the time they deserve, or to actually notify all the creators which story they are on at any given time. Maybe that’s a little paranoid, but I think we’d all appreciate the transparency! I know I would!\nThis is a smaller complaint, but I noticed that someone who entered the contest basically got a free sub boost and advertisement from Tapas because they were entering the contest and at the same time Tapas did an interview with them that ended up in the entire community’s inboxes. That was kinda unfair. XD\nIt goes without saying that Tapas should be completely transparent about their guidelines next time concerning mature content. It's fine that you only allow PG-13/safe for work content to win, but you need to define what that is and, more importantly, notify all entrants that it is not allowed before starting the contest.\nLastly, I was extremely shocked by the sudden announcement of the winners! I think this was the most baffling thing, but we never even got told the date they were going to announce the winners! They just said… Sometime in February, and then BAM! It suddenly appeared in my inbox!I am only critical of this site because I actually really love it and want it to succeed! I hope you'll listen to these suggestions~!\n""]",2/8/2019 20:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We at Tapas can't wait to read your novels!

UPDATE 11/5/18:Hi everyone! We have an important update regarding the rules for Writers Camp x NaNoWriMo. 
After receiving feedback from both community writers and Premium creators, we’ve had some discussions and reached a decision to update the rules. Although Premium creators are welcome to join this round of Writers Camp, they will not be eligible for either of the two Community Prizes (which are determined based on subscriber count).
We made this choice because we wanted to give a fair chance to all of the writers in this contest. Current Premium authors may already have an established readership, which can affect their series’ number of subscribers during Writers Camp. Although we appreciate everyone’s hard work, we want to give an equal opportunity to undiscovered writers and encourage readers to find new favorites.
That being said, Premium creators are still eligible for the Editors’ Choice prize! We’re reading all of the entries we receive, and we’re excited to consider every single one of them. 
Whether you’ve been publishing with us for a long time or this is your first shot at writing, we can’t wait to read your story. Thank you for writing with us, and we hope you have a great Writers Camp x NaNoWriMo!

288,Tapas Tarot Card Collab 2017!?! - Perhaps After Christmas?!?!?,Events | Challenges,[],"If you've seen this post:


Artwork Critque?


    Hey everyone! So...I recently did this illustration for a macabre fairy tale book and I was wondering if anyone would like to provide some feedback? It's a very different style from what I work in normally and am just wondering if anyone has any tips/suggestions! It was a fun project, I might want to try this style again!  

If you'd like to see my normal style, you can check out my comic Wednesday7. 

 [image]

Thanks in advanced!  (PS. I am aware size-wise she is rather big, but I did that int…
  


Some of us came up with a really cool collaboration idea for Tapas creators!
Based on @VikiKuli 's artwork (see post) I thought it was very much like a tarot card. Many of us agreed which led to a really cool idea of us CREATORS coming up with our own designs for a collection of tarots!
Most tarot card sets have 78 spots, which can be a lot of potential creators all in one place. If anyone is interested, (INCLUDING ADMINS) we can come together to make a card or two and use them to promote smaller creators and big time creators all at once!
It can be super fun!","['This actually sounds really cool. I dont mind joining in.', 'The more the merrier!The more we get interested, the more can get the admins involved', ""Oh, I'd love to do this~! uwu It sounds really cool!\nWould the Tarot cards be randomly assigned, or first come-first serve?"", ""Not 100% sure, but it would probably go that way if we're all in for it"", 'Dibs on Queen of Diamonds.', ""This sounds really neat! I'd be interested in something like this! There's so many imaginative people here on Tapas that the cards would be amazing!"", 'I would love to join in! ', ""If you'll have me I would do so, but is there a due date?"", ""I'd not mind having Wheel of Fortune, but alas, I cannot be involved. \nI have a BIG schedule for December and this week! owo\nUNLESS you can save that slot for me until after December~?"", '@vincentprendick  Perhaps we could save the project for early next year after the holidays? Like @YangKoete, my December is kind of hectic. Besides, this would give more time for creators to sign up and decide what to draw. One month goes by in a flash >_>', ""Ya perhaps make it a 2018 project?? Also I would love to take part I can't draw per say but I mess around in Adobe Illustrator a lot. It would probably be in a style similar to my avatar on here... "", ""Absolutely! We could organize this early which can make sure that we get a bunch of creators in, rather than squeezing it in for Christmas or whichever.It can also help promote the idea itself more. 78 cards is a lot to research and compile. Even if this is done loosely (say we can just make up the cards and not everything has to be based on actual tarots), and we don't strictly make 78 individual illustrations, it is still a lot of people to manage.\nPerhaps... is there some sort of national holiday that this even can coincide with?We could shoot for that as a time limit, and it can give creators time to make their individual card(s)!Sound like a decent plan to shoot for?\nI would love to see if anyone else agrees to next year as a plan of action!"", ""This sounds like fun.  I'd be happy to join if you'll have me."", ""Halloween would probably be the most appropriate holiday .3. But that's kinda far away.\nThere's also World Tarot Card Day on May 25th uwu But idk if that's a real holiday"", ""Yeah, I have many things from a tabletop game I can use. \nI wanna make Wheel of Fortune the most, but I'll probably end up making all of 'em some day >w<'"", '\n\nrainbowolfe:\nThere\'s also World Tarot Card Day on May 25th uwu But idk if that\'s a real holiday\nWe will make it a real holiday.\nBut seriously, this is a chance to reach a lot of people. You\'ve got your usual webcomic readers, but also your collectors and your mystics and your tabletop gamers. There\'s no shortage of new and traditional games that use Tarot cards (but I\'m wondering if there isn\'t a way to use them as replacements for gaming dice.)\nI\'ve been reading the cards for over a decade so I can offer my services as a consultant. The deck will most likely be a standard Rider-Waite clone but I\'m here to explain the symbolism. \nThe first thing you need to know is that every Tarot deck is divided into two parts. There\'s the 22-card Major Arcana, which contains all the cards that movies get wrong, like ""Death"" and ""The Devil"" and ""The Lovers."" \nThere\'s also the 56-card Minor Arcana, which is much like a regular deck of cards. As with playing cards there are four suits: wands, pentacles, swords, and cups, which correspond with both the suits of clubs, diamonds, spades, and hearts and also the elements of fire, earth, air, and water. As with playing cards, each Tarot suit has cards that go from ace to ten. Each suit also has a page, a knight, a queen, and a king.', 'This sounds fun!, is there an official list of the 78 Tarot cards i can find?', ""Wikipedia has articles on both the major and minor arcana. Here's a TV Tropes link.5"", ""Aah...! I'd love to participate here!I used to have a lot of tarot decks, books and other stuff years ago (then, I moved and left everything there. So sad.). I know that there're a lot of cards and I wouldn't mind in drawing any of them, but I'd really really love drawing the Hanged Man or the Mage, they were the first cards I learned to analyze properly and, well, stuff hahaha""]",11/21/2017 19:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ideas for FutureFor anyone who wants a more in depth discussion on how to fix up the event or even make new ones, see here.
Secret Santa issues:- including novelists. (Biggest concern right now. Is the current method the best one? What should we do if more people want drawings than those who can give? Should the event be art related only but anyone can join?)- get more people to sign up
Future event idea- discussion piece themed around certain topics. not really an event.(Honestly, based on something I used to be a part of and moderate. Artists discuss unique topics such as ""webtoons vs manga vs comics"" or ""traditional vs digital."" Just a brainstorm. Can elaborate more.)- summer secret santa(mentioned multiple times in the surveys. People generally seem against it but can bring it up again if necessary. Would probably be less anonymous as well but basically two art exchanges in one year.)-bleh","[""As much as I hate to say it, I think more people will want art than fan fiction. It might be better to do separate ones, but then i don't know if the novelists will want to join in.\nThe only other option might be people don't get a choice what they get- they get what the other person can do. If everyone knows this going in, there shouldn't be complaints. It would mean tho, that people couldn't be very specific about what they wanted other than characters they would like to see included and any basic notes on how they get along.\nFor getting more people to sign up- if Tapas is supporting this, then maybe next year they can pin the thread. I only saw it because it happened to get bumped after we started the comic and became active on the forum. Otherwise I never would have known it was happening.\nAs a side note, a summer event could be fun but messy. People often are busy during the summer and off doing things. It's easy to lose track of everything."", ""Last year it got pinned like a week before the deadline. But it kept getting unpinned evey time I clicked on it for me, which was weird. I'll see if I can pester them again next time. Honestly, if everyone on the forums saw it, I imagine more like 100 people participating rather than 30. Which would actually be horrifying but great at the same time.The reason I couldn't this time was because, as Son said, they were doing their Writer's camp. So there are two main issues I'm trying to figure out. \n\nNovelists and artists in the same event\ntimeline for Secret Santa so that it doesn't overlap with other events\n\nI see your idea about people not having a choice. Would allow it to be more randomized (I had to deliberately pick out people who had no preference or wanted a novel). I don't think it would be too bad if people couldn't request something specific as it's mostly supposed to be a surprise. This can be considered but I would need more feedback since we can only try this once a year. If I did do a summer version, then that could be the experimental one."", ""That'll be tough then because the novel writing stuff happens in Nov right? Maybe if it started sign ups Oct 1, ended the 31st and then sent the people their stuff on Nov 1. That could avoid the writing event."", ""This looked like a lot of fun. I hope to join in next year! (I didn't quite get it and was kind of swamped with other projects around Christmas, so I didn't join...)"", ""Yeah, no problem! Feel free to subscribe to the series or just keep a look out on the forums come next year. I plan on using the series to update those who follow it when next year's event comes"", 'All right! Sounds like a plan! See you next year! ', ""October is Inktober. That's why one thing I was considering was to have the event later. Maybe signups be towards the end of November, people have the month of December to do their piece, results are posted in January or later. I'm considering this one, though I preferred everyone get their stuff done right before Christmas. Maybe after is a better goal"", ""i've participated in a summer santa before (and no my computer didnt die then aswell XDD), it wasn't that bad but the rules were kinda against my favour tho (no OCs was the rule :/)"", ""After would be abetter goal then, but it doesn't seem like much of a secret Santa then if you can't get it till January (assuming they are all mostly on time). At that point it might be better to call it something else?\nNew Year's fresh takes or something?"", 'Well, i want to say that i\'m intrigued by ""discussion piece themed around certain topics"". Though i\'d rather want a discussion about ""how to make good story (good as in pacing, etc.) and how to make good art (good as in proportions, etc.)"". You know, there\'s that person who\'s really good at the art side but totally bad at the story, and vice versa :\')', ""Everyone's efforts, both artistic and written, are wonderful!  I'm still scrolling through them all  I love these kind of events. They're so much fun and the results are always amazing!"", 'Well, I think it\'s alright if it\'s still considered a secret santa exchange, even if the exchange is done a bit late. Hrmm, it\'s just a challenge when trying to fit it within the other events that are happening around these times. So fitting it in around the end of the holiday season feels like best place.  I \nI can try asking again if it\'s pinned globally next year as it\'s more art oriented rather than writing oriented like the Writer\'s Camp is. I feel like it shouldn\'t be too much of a conflict; it\'s small after all. If that can\'t happen though, then I do want it to be held at a later date so that I don\'t have to rely on ""bumping""the topic for it to get attention.\nI like the idea of it being Secret Santa, is what I mean. That\'s where idea originated from, back in the IB days', '\n\nGlasgwyn:\nWell, i want to say that i\'m intrigued by ""discussion piece themed around certain topics"". Though i\'d rather want a discussion about ""how to make good story (good as in pacing, etc.) and how to make good art (good as in proportions, etc.)"". You know, there\'s that person who\'s really good at the art side but totally bad at the story, and vice versa :\')\nIt\'s a very light thought at the moment. It would probably be something like a podcast that goes for couple hours every month or two weeks (just an example) where people discuss those topics. Maybe certain ""episodes"" could be more technical. Just one topic alone could be ""What makes a story \'good\'"" and that could go on for who knows how long\nThen other topics might just be sharing thoughts/experiences (ie. ""Thoughts on LGBT+ presence in comics"" or ""Mental health in comics"" or ""poltics in comics""). Discussing technical subjects such as ""vertical or horizontal panels"" or ""traditional vs digital"" or ""digital programs""', 'Well, i think the podcast-like idea is good. Just wanted to say, ""if"" you decide to make one i\'ll totally join.', 'This was super fun, thanks everyone! ^^', '@utdragongirl\nHave you seen my message to you?

291,JJ’s Tapas NEW Secret Santa 2018,Events | Challenges,[],"Secret Santa Sign-Up Link24
= the people who signed up on the first thread don't have to reapply, I will manually put your info in again as an apology for messing up the first thread.

Hey there I am JJ the creator of Beautiful Lies12. I may not have been very active on forums due to real life stuff going on but I am always here for our Secret Santa! 
For past few years, I've set up a Secret Santa for artists to draw each other's OC's and post them around Christmas! You can see the previous ones here: 201713 | 20163 | 20154
Note: This year will be experimenting with a new system that involves both Novelists and Comic artists. I ALREADY made a booboo as it's a bit more complicated and a bit less random when considering two different styles. This is still very experimental at the moment.

Guidelines

You HAVE TO sign up through Google Forms in order to be added to the participants list.
If you have a comic or visual novel, follow the instructions under ""Comic Artists"" on what to provide.
If you have a novel, follow the instructions under ""Novelists"" on what to provide.

In the sign-up sheet, you will specify whether you want to receive an illustration or a short story. 
This is so a comic artists can receive written fanfic and writers can receive fanart if they wish.



Rules
You will be assigned to someone's comic or novel at random and have until the deadline to draw the character(s) your assignee requests in the theme they want. If they give no special requests, it's up to your creativity. 

For comic artists, you will be making an illustration; fanart in your own unique style. It should be a coloured piece unless your unique style (or your assignee's) is black and white.
For novelists, you will have until the deadline to write a short story about their character(s). Ideally, at least a ten page chapter that illustrates what your assignee requests but this isn't a strict requirement. If they make no specific requests, it's up to your creativity to bring their characters to life through writing. 

The following are what YOU will need to provide for your story to be added in the Secret Santa.
Comic Artists

Must have a comic on Tapastic with at least one chapter that includes the character/characters you want drawn/written about.This is so we can get a good idea of your character's personality

You must have at least one full body, coloured reference of your characterDoesn't have to be ""good."" Just need colours so we know what they look like!

Name any special requests
Willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and draw two secret santas?)

Novelists

Must have a story on Tapastic with at least one chapter that includes the character/characters you want to be written about.This is so we can get a good idea of your character's personality

You must provide a (drawn or written) physical description of your character or characters. If you have a unique setting you want your character to be in, make sure to describe this as well.This can be provided through links to specific pages or by writing a custom description on the sign-up sheet.

Name any special requests
Willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and draw two secret santas?)

Everyone

If you are a Comic Artist, it is assumed you will be providing an illustration. 
If you want to write fanfiction instead, you will have to specify in the sign-up sheet. Same applies to Novelists

This is because you are showcasing your talent as an artist/writer outside of your ongoing work!


After the signup deadline has passed, you will receive a participant number and everyone will be given a Secret Santa at random
A deadline will be given as encouragement to complete the work, especially as a Christmas gift!
When you complete your piece, email it to me at this address. Your email should include ""Secret Santa"" and your participant number in the title. Comic artists can email me any picture format. Novelists must email me either a Word document or PDF file of their short stories.

If you decide to drop out half way through, message me and I will have someone take your place
I value commitment so this is for emergencies only. Do not sign up if you do not think you can commit to it.



Sign-Up Deadline: CLOSED
= After signups are complete, I will send everyone their number and their assignee as well as the deadline the following Friday.
Secret Santa Deadline: December 26th

Other Comments

Make sure to bookmark this thread so you can stay up to date with any news or changes
Reply to this thread for any questions you have, that which I'm sure there will be many. 
This year, instead of making a new thread with everyone's gifts, I'm going to publish them as a series on the main website. Everyone's work will be an episode and we can all guess who did what. I think this will be a fun experiment and will help showcase everyone's amazing skill
A lot has changed since I last hosted the Secret Santa. Novelists are now here on Tapas and I want to make sure to include them. After every Secret Santa, I post a survey and this year especially, is important to get everyone's feedback. I'm just saying I'm going to be begging you all to fill out the survey.
I'm going to see if the Secret Santa results can get a spotlight for EXTRA attention. We will have to see (I have to ask Michael again, he probably forgot the conversation, it WAS a year ago after all). (pssst. Also, if you're reading this, you guys can join too!)

SSid: nnx012Name: Kris Dragyn6Novel: Madame Dragyn's Potion ShoppeCharacter(s): Charlotte (Madame Dragyn), Victoria, and ElizabethDescription: ""Charlotte has nearly black hair and light blue eyes. She usually keeps her hair up in a messy bun, similar to the picture in the title card. She's a slim woman in her mid twenties and is about 5' 8"""". She lives in a steampunk era, so she would have that kind of dress. She dresses fairly feminine in nature, and likes to wear extravagant dresses on special occasions.. She's a simple shopkeeper, and is generally happy.Victoria has platinum blonde hair that is cut pretty short. She usually has it slicked over, similarly to the men's popular hairstyles of the 1910s. She also wears trousers everyday, and probably has never worn a skirt or dress in her life if she could avoid it. Victoria also will wear button up shirts, and will wear ties when the occasion calls for it. She also has dark blue eyes and is about 5' 1"""" tall. She can be intense, but sees Charlotte and Elizabeth as sisters to her. She's also in her mid twenties.Elizabeth has light brown hair and has green eyes. She's more reserved than the other two, but likes to be involved. She's in her early twenties and is about 5' 3"""" tall. She dresses a little more fashionable than Charlotte does, but isn't over dressed. She usually keeps her hair down, and the length of her hair goes down to her waist. Sometimes, she'll braid it or put it up when she needs to be more formal.The shop is simple, and is an older building. Charlotte does her best to keep it nice, but she can be a little disorganized. She mainly sells potions in different vials and bottles. Shelves line the shop with different potions and ingredients on them. There's a counter near the back wall with the cash register that also houses a glass case. The more expensive items are in there. There's a back door behind the counter with a desk where Charlotte makes all the potions. There's a coat hanger next to the back room that houses aprons and their coats.""Requests: I think it would be fun for the girls to be having a Christmas party in the shoppe. There could be a bunch of coniferous garland lining the shoppe with a large decorated fir tree in the corner. The girls could be dancing with their neighbors and having a good Christmas party. I also want the girls to be dressed in more formal party wear that fits a Christmas theme. Like, lots of deep reds and dark greens. Maybe a wreath crown on Elizabeth. You are great!

If gender is important to your drawings or imaginings of them, Blue and Red are programed as male and Build-a and Query are programed as female. Otherwise, let your creative juices flow!
If you are drawing anything about them from their POV- the only colors any of them can see is Brown, Red, Blue, Grey, Black, and White. They cannot even UNDERSTAND the words of other colors. There are, however, more colors in the world. (please keep this under your hat as it is important story wise later).

Feel free to ask anything if you're unsure about something such as the timeline"", 'While I too think that integrating artist and writers in the same event is a good a idea, it\'d be awesome if both could be ""together"", because having to separate them, like in two groups or having them fill two separated forms, may feel like they\'re doing 2 different events, like SS artist and SS writers, not a single event, all tapastic\'s SS!.\nI know it may pose a challenge, but artist will only get art and writers will only get words. But what if writers wanted art too, I mean, isn\'t it awesome to have a drawing of your character?. And what if some artist would want a short story?. \nDunno if all writers want words, I think a lot will prefer art, and since most of em would think: I can\'t draw, what do I do?. If there could be a way, like conducting a survey to know what people really want, or having an option in the form where you could write what you\'d want: art or writting.it may show a bit about people\'s preferences.\nI don\'t know if the prospect of having them separated in two groups (artist will only get art and writters will only get writting) will turn people\'s off.\nBut like I say, yeah it may be a challenge to really have them integrated.', 'I think you should make a separate form for the writers who might art and the artists who want written work', ""the one question that says you can skip, you can't skip (the file upload one)\nalso it keeps asking for my Novel... i don't have one"", ""\nIf you toggle this off on that question, should do the trick :> (@jjfresh in regard to bobby's comment)"", ""I signed up just now for this. Its my first time participating in a secret Santa like this. I can't wait to see how it turns out."", ""I've updated it. Is it going through now?"", ""Menbung, is that really you?\nSo, right now, it's being set up so that people can chose to receive a drawn gift or written or either if they have no preference. The reason I originally didn't do this is because of several issues when merging these two mediums together- Likely will not be an equal balance of writers and comic artists- What if more people want fanart than those who can provide- This forces a less random pairing of secret santas due to preferences and such\nMy biggest concern is the second bullet point there. These are three bullets because I don't want to get into the organization challenge the integration brings. I may have to return to the art only idea but I wanted to have novelists be included. We're playing with the idea now and will have to accept complications that come with the experiment.\n\n\nMenbung:\nIf there could be a way, like conducting a survey to know what people really want, or having an option in the form where you could write what you'd want: art or writting.it may show a bit about people's preferences.\n I don't know if you saw the sign up sheet or the guidelines.

So you could have a better idea of what to expect in terms of offer and demand, but since things are already rolling, complications will have to be dealt.\nYup I also think that more people would want art, so the offer could be the one lacking. \nI couldn't check the sing up sheet, coz it prompted me to sing up or something, dunno if it meant loggin in my google account... But from what I understood the thing was to mention if you would like to draw or write (or both), not what type of gift you'd ideally want (art or words).\nThat's the issue with the pairing, coz maybe they'd be witers that ideally would want art as a gift but not enough artists to provide."", ""I just inform I have signed up and to keep this up so people can find it.I don't mind gift as written work or drawing, but I will absolutely and certainly be giving drawing."", ""sorry I dunno if this was in the survey or not but I'm gonna be receiving art and not writing, right?"", ""You can choose it in the form, what kind of prize you'd like to get"", 'yeah, but I filled out the old form.', ""I think if you're a comic maker, you'd be automatically sorted for drawing prize?Just ask @jjfresh to make sure?"", ""Hey, if you chose comic artist, I'm assuming you will make and receive an illustration.

296,Comic Tea Party - Event Info & Reading List Sign-up,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone~! In an effort to promote indie comics/webcomics even more, StArt Faire would like to invite creators and readers alike to join us for Comic Tea Party~! Comic Tea Party is a weekly discussion group focused on reading and conversing about comics.  Every Thursday, a new comic is chosen from our reading queue. Participants have one week to read however much of the chosen comic they would like.  Come the following Thursday, from 5 PM to 7 PM PST, participants will meet up on the #comicteaparty channel on StArt Faire’s Discord server to discuss the comic.  The discussion will be fairly freeform, but occasional discussion prompts/questions will be dropped into the chat to encourage the discussion continues.
There’s no requirement to joining the chat other than showing up, and you’re also free to leave the chat at any time.  The goal of this event is to encourage not only more reading of indie comics (regardless of popularity), but to also encourage more reader participation.  So if you can, please drop on by and chat with us.
StArt Faire Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/2mjbwTG14
For more information, including the comprehensive schedule, FAQ, and more, please check out our website: https://comicteaparty.tumblr.com/14
You can also follow us on Twitter for the latest updates: https://twitter.com/ComicTeaParty4

Before we close out, please know we’re still open for comics on our reading list~!  To be eligible to volunteer your comic, all we ask is the following: 

Comics volunteered should have at least 20 pages.
Comics volunteered should not have graphic sex or graphic violence at this time.
Please only volunteer if you are okay with constructive criticism that may come up during the conversation.

If you can meet these standards, then you are eligible for the reading list. To sign up for the reading list, you can apply via this Google Form (the comic does not have to be on Tapas btw  ): https://goo.gl/forms/odaWwrvZALiOLAFg18

Teaching English In Another World! | Tapas
*3rd Writer’s Camp Entry - A fantasy comedy*
This story is out of this world — literally. 

Kurata Seiji is an English teacher. He has taught many students. But he has never taught elves. Until now. 

Kurata-sensei is summoned (read: kidnapped)...





Summary: Kurata Seiji is an English teacher. He has taught many students. But he has never taught elves. Until now. 
Kurata-sensei is summoned (read: kidnapped) to another world by Elisa. Why? Because she and other elves want to learn English. Why? Because they discovered a magical thing called Netflicks. 
He is tasked with teaching a class of elves. And he discovers that every elf has become hopelessly addicted to the Internet, Netflicks and video games. These elves need much more than just an A in their exams. They need some basic life lessons. 
Can Kurata-sensei go above and beyond the call of duty? 

And I am so proud to be working together with the awesome artist KORCHUP for this cover art:

SIGN UP FORM HERE21

\I was wondering if we had anything like that in our community, and if anyone would like one organized?
Since October has just started, this leaves us with a little bit less than 3 months to get this organized.
I'm thinking that we have participants sign-up via Google Forms and close the form submission date by Halloween. On Nov 1st, you'll get a PM on who your Secret Santa is, and you have from Nov 2-Dec 24 to complete a piece of writing, artwork, or comic as a gift! 
The google form will have questions like ""What kind of gift do you prefer: writing or artwork?"" and ""What kind of gift do you think you can gift someone else?"" so we can pair you up appropriately!
I also feel that it should be an acceptable option to give someone a commissioned piece if you could not find the time to do something for yourself or did not feel capable to do what your Secret Santa wants.
If there are 10+ likes on this OP, I'll make the form and organize this. It wouldn't be too good to do a Secret Santa event with only 3 people, would it? :^)

My favorites are: How Did This Get Made?:2 basically talking about bad movies and the stories behind them. Who Charted?: they go over Top 5 movie, music, and tv charts with guest comedians and talk about why they liked or didn't like the things on them. The comedians and hosts also talk about their lives, so it's got this friendly personal feel that I kinda dig.\nThe other podcasts I listen to that are a little more serious are:Yo, is this Racist?: where people call in and ask the hosts about things that happened to them that are possibly racist and the hosts talk about why the things are problematic and give advice on how to fix them. This description makes it sound really serious, but the host is really smart/funny/sweet and so it's enjoyable to listen to.This American Life: Each episode is a selection of stories or interviews on a certain topic.

Or I'm in hangout talking to other people as we all attempt to hear one another over the loud noises and voices coming from my house."", ""OH yeah, it's not superscary. It's more dark tones and strange happenings. Kind of paranormal. But no screamers, jumpscares, or gore(as far as I know)"", 'ALL OF THEM! D: I am such a podcast-addict, it\'s ridiculous. \nI listen to a bunch of stuff, but I\'m mostly into the narrative-format history-themed ones - I mean the ones that devote their entire podcast series to one area of history, and take however many episodes they need to do it. It lets me kind of sink into the subject and really learn, and unlike those podcasts that skip to a new subject with every episode, I don\'t have to be introduced to something new every time. \nSo, here goes! \nHistory of Rome by Mike Duncan - how many Roman emperors can you name? If one of them is Elgabalus, the cross-dressing bisexual Syrian teenager who believed himself to be literally a god, I will be deeply impressed. If you haven\'t heard of him, 179 episodes of Mike Duncan\'s chronicle of Rome awaits you! Follow one of the world\'s greatest empire from rural obscurity to center of the known world to absolute ruin. \nThe History of Byzantium1 by Robin Pierson. Picks up where the History of Rome left off in the late 400s and follows the Eastern Roman empire and its crumbling existence, with the intention of going all the way to the 1400s and the capitulation to the Turks. Dives really deep into stuff like early Christian church-schisms, daily life in Constantinople, political structures, ethnic conflicts, etc., etc. \nThe British History Podcast1 by Jamie Jeffers. One day, Jaime Jeffers woke up with the idea that he was going to do a podcast, detailing the history of Britain from its earliest Ice Age-origins up until World War 2. It\'s been 4 years and 173 episodes, and he\'s only just getting to the Vikings. If you\'ve ever asked yourself the question ""What did British people EAT in the year 672?"", this is the podcast for you. And even if you haven\'t! Jaime gets really deep into every aspect of British history, and he\'s doing a champion job of it too. \nHistory of the Crusades1 by Sharyn Eastaugh. Why is the Middle East such a mess today, and what did the Holy Roman Emperor have to do with it? Listen to this podcast, and you\'ll find out! Having wrapped up her chronicle of the Crusades as they are traditionally considered, Sharyn Eastaugh has moved on to the more obscure ones, like the crusade against the Katars, in which the Catholic church fought other Christians in Southern France. Be warned, though; she does NOT flinch away from the goriest aspects of the crusades. There is a LOT of blood and violence and mutilation. \nRevolutions by Mike Duncan. Having wrapped up his Herculean task of telling us the history of Rome, Mike Duncan has moved on to another topic - revolutions. He\'s gotten through the English Revolution (which brought Oliver Cromwell into the historical limelight) and the American Revolution, and is drawing to the close of his section on the French Revolution. Next up - Haiti! \nThe Egyptian History Podcast1 by Dominic Perry. I\'m only a few episodes into this one, but it\'s nice to listen to a podcast on Egypt written and narrated by an actual Egyptologist who is intent on clearing away all the mysticism and myth and outright lies surrounding the history of Egypt. Lots of talk about archeological sites, the unreliability of historical narratives and pottery in the first few episodes!\nStuff you Missed in History Class1 - if you, unlike me, don\'t WANT to spend 100+ episodes learning about the same thing, this podcast might be for you! 1-2 episodes on each subject, getting into everything from sad royal childhoods to \'orrible murders and the history of peanut butter. \nAlso, like @rainbowolfe I listen to Welcome to Nightvale. It\'s got a few genuinely unsettling moments (and there\'s this one sequence in a more recent episode with a very, very nasty sound that occurs suddenly that actually made me throw my headphones off - yikes!), but mostly it\'s just weird and off-beat and entirely lovely. It\'s more surrealistic than it is horrific. ', ""Oohhh, congratulations!!\nPodcasts I listen to: Good job, Brain!2 All sorts of trivia, love it!\nStuff you should know. Sort of like GJB, but always with a subject and not in the trivia format.\nBack to work. The podcast that tells you that buying a new pen will not make you better at writing. About productivity and life hacks. \nJenna and Julien podcast. I've been watching Jenna Marbles videos on YouTube since the beginning, and I'm a big fan! Now she also does a podcast with her boyfriend, about all sorts of things, it's good fun."", ""\n\nAnnaLandin:\nStuff you Missed in History Class - if you, unlike me, don't WANT to spend 100+ episodes learning about the same thing, this podcast might be for you! 1-2 episodes on each subject, getting into everything from sad royal childhoods to 'orrible murders and the history of peanut butter.\nThis is also MY favorite Podcast!"", 'I always loved Professor Blastoff! (and then it ended...)', ""@AnnaLandin Welp. I think I'm stocked up for the next 20 years. BRB downloading a terabytes worth of podcasts! Thanks bb!!"", ""Don't be afraid to message or reply if you and your teeammate get around to listening to the martial art podcasts. I'm interested to hear what you think of 'em. Karate Cafe although called Karate Cafe is about martial arts in general and covers different styles. Muay Thai Guy, well. It's all in the name. Hey, that sounds cool starting from a traditional background and learning more of sport fighting will probably make you feel like you understand certain things more even if you don't become interested in competition. I always wanted to learn Tai Chi myself, I feel like it'd balance me out.\nI may just have to start anew as it seems the host website I used isn't coming back and it might be better to start fresh than just using the same name on a different host. I interviewed some cool people like former Supergirl artist Jamal Igle on my old podcast and I wish I could get those episodes back. My external hard driveI backed them up on broke on me."", ""WOW this is fantastic! I love all the recommendations from everyone. I'll have to check your podcast. I'm always down to listen to new people. Actually just got into listening to podcast just recently. One of my favorites is http://tightpencils.com1 <--- great resource for insight in freelancers who do comics and also publish."", ""I only recently started listening to podcasts while working, but the two I love are Make it Then Tell Everybody with Dan Berry & guests (interviewing comic artists, talking about how they got into comics, where they get their ideas from, their process and so on), and Dirty Old Ladies with Kel McDonald, Amanda Lafrenais and C. Spike Trotman, which is mostly tips for self published/webcomic artists, and a lot about how things have changed in the comic/webcomic/convention scenes over the years.\nI am definitely going to check out some of those history podcasts, @AnnaLandin!\nAnd not really a podcast, but I treat it like one (or like a radio drama), Critical Role, where professional voice actors play D&D. It's got video so it doesn't count as a podcast, but I usually just listen while I draw, so to me it works like one. Kinda."", 'woah im so into podcasts. this whole thread is super useful\ni havent really found any comic booky ones i like yet. but i reeeaaally like listenin to bizarre states at nerdist2 which is all about spoopy stuff that im supes into\ni also like shane and friends where a youtuber dude interviews other youtubers and its funny i think\num but yeah. thats all i got really. ima lurk about on all of yall suggestions now']",8/22/2015 14:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
309,JJ’s Tapas Secret Santa 2018 - Sign Up,Events | Challenges,[],"
Secret Santa Sign-Up Link9  - On Hold
Some just pointed out a massive flaw in the guidelines. I'm going through it and may end up reposting the thread. I recommend holding back on signing up for now

Hey there I am JJ the creator of Beautiful Lies4. I may not have been very active on forums due to real life stuff going on but I am always here for our Secret Santa! 
For past few years, I've set up a Secret Santa for artists to draw each other's OC's and post them around Christmas! You can see the previous ones here:

2017 Secret Santa4
2016 Secret Santa1
2015 Secret Santa3

I'm starting the sign up sheet early this year so we can give plenty of time for people to join. 
Important: This year we will be experimenting with a new Secret Santa that involves both Novelists and Comic artists! Technically, there will be two sections to the Secret Santa: one will be illustrations and the other will be writing. You can sign up for both if you would like but don't take more than you can handle!

The following information is what you will need to provide. You HAVE TO sign up through Google Forms this year in order to be added to the participants list. Both Secret Santas have slightly different rules for what you need to provide
Deadline for signing up will be November 10
**After signups are complete, I will post the assignments and the deadline the following Friday.

Secret Santa Rules and Guidelines
Comic Artists You will be assigned to someone's comic at random and have until the deadline to draw the character or characters your assignee requests in the theme they want. If they give no special requests, it's up to your creativity. 
Below is what you need to provide for your Secret Santa:

Must have a story on Tapastic with at least one chapter that includes the character/characters you want drawn/written about.This is so we can get a good idea of your character's personality

You must have at least one full body, coloured reference of your characterDoesn't have to be ""good."" Just need colours so we know what they look like!

Name any special requests
Willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and draw two secret santas?)

NovelistsYou will be assigned to someone's novel and have until the deadline to write a short story about their character or characters. Ideally, at least a ten page chapter that illustrates what your assignee requests. If they make no specific requests, it's up to your creativity to bring their characters to life through writing. 
Below is what you need to provide for your Secret Santa:

Must have a story on Tapastic with at least one chapter that includes the character/characters you want to be written about.This is so we can get a good idea of your character's personality

You must provide a (drawn or written) physical description of your character or characters. If you have a unique setting you want your character to be in, make sure to describe this as well.This can be provided through links to specific pages or by writing a custom description on the sign-up sheet.

Name any special requests
Willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and draw two secret santas?)

Everyone

If you are signing up for both, you will have to fill out the form twice. This will be like signing up for two different Secret Santas so it's a lot of work! You will also need to inform me because the sign-up sheet assumes Novelists will have novels only and Comic artists will have comics only.
After the signup deadline has passed, everyone will be given a Secret Santa at random
A deadline will be given as encouragement to complete the work, especially as a Christmas gift!
Once completed, there will be a new thread for which you can post your secret santa on. More details will be added later.
If you decide to drop out half way through, message me and I will have someone take your place


I value commitment so this is for emergencies only. Do not sign up if you do not think you can commit to it.


Additional Information

Make sure to bookmark this thread so you can stay up to date with any news or changes
A lot has changed since I last hosted the Secret Santa. Novelists are now here on Tapas and I want to make sure to include them. Previously, I still made the Secret Santa a drawing event only but we will be testing a new system this year. I always conduct a survey at the end of every year and I will gladly accept suggestions for the future!
In the rules, I say you must have a story with at least one chapter on Tapas. This can be in the form of a novel OR webcomic. All that matters, as stated above, is that you are able to provide a full image of your character(s) and can make one for your present.
When you complete your piece, email it to me at this address. Your email should include ""Secret Santa"" and your participant number in the title. Comic artists can email me any picture format. Novelists must email me either a Word document or PDF file of their short stories.(I am also gladly accepting future suggestions to make this process smoother)
Reply to this thread for any questions you have, that which I'm sure there will be many. 
I also want to ask that we may be able to get the Secret Santa results getting featured (I have to ask Michael again, he probably forgot the conversation, it WAS a year ago after all). 

(pssst. Also, if you're reading this, you guys can join too!)

Secret Santa Deadline: TBD

Info About Results
This year, I am going to publish the secret santa as a series on the main website. Everyone's secret santa will be posted as an episode and we can guess who's whom. I think this will be a fun experiment to see them all together. I imagine Novelist's secret santa will be harder to guess so for this year, Comic artist's secret santas will be secret (until they reveal themselves) and Novelists will have their name included in their gift. The link to the series will be included here when it is made available.

310,The Artists-Writers Exchange Round #1,Events | Challenges,[],"In a world where the grass is always greener on the other side, we all kind of wish we had skills we don’t possess. Whether it’s writing as an artist, drawing as an author, or just knowing how to tackle a different style, there’s a lot for all of us to learn: but that’s doesn’t mean we can’t indulge in it while we try.
The Artist-Writer Exchange (Round #1) is an experimental short term trade-off for people who want to use their expertise to get something new in return. 
Essentially working like a secret santa, here are the exact rules: - Each participant will identify themselves as either an artist or writer - Each participant will identify what they’d like to get from this trade (a piece of or art, or a piece of writing) - A list of genres for writing, and style influences for drawings will be provided to further assist a smooth exchange - Each creator will get 2 weeks to work on their piece- The minimum amount of work required from artists is a fully colored waist up drawing of a single character. The minimum amount of work required from the writers is a 500 word short story.- People requesting artwork will have to provide a visual or text-based description of the character, people requesting written work will have to provide a 1 paragraph description of their characters or a short work the writer can turn to for reference.- In case a creator does not complete their work a backup artist/writer will be deployed and the creator that flunked will be issued a warning or banned from further participation, depending on the specific case. - On the day of the deadline, all participating parties will send a message to their recipients with their finished works. 
The first round, since it’s still experimental, will be limited to 10 participants! I’ll do my best to match people up with what they ask for, but be aware it’s possible you won’t get exaclty what you asked for.
Interested?Fill out this form!

The corporeals of Piloud City would like to take a coffee with you! 
So post here a thumbnail or a picture of your OC that would like to drink some coffee with any of the officers in the picture
Also with wich officer would you like to drink a coffee?

Officer Layla Volkov   (Height: 1.74 m )

Sgt. Mei Li  (Height: 1.59 m )

Sgt. Andrew Anderson (Height: 1.70 m )

Officer Carter Denzel Johnson (Height: 1.80 m )



Also note yourself in If there are some Police officers in your comic and would like to drink some coffee with other people OC's (and you wouldn't mind drawing them yourself) Also if you feel like to you can draw your characters with the officers yourself . 
Let's Do this thing people!!!

Would like to read the comic, CLICK THE BANNER!!!

You won't believe me, but I actually had a similar idea regarding our characters, since two police officers will appear in my second chapter right at the beginning and I thought it would be nice to make a lil' crossover illustration myself. Actually I think that Anderson would be the guy who would make every coffee break enjoyable and fun but I want to think about the choice of characters a while since I can even choose between these four.Anyway... exclusively for you (and everyone else here) a preview draft of the mentioned characters who will appear in chapter 2 of Erlmaiden Discordia!

The total prize money is $750! As you can see below, not only the best entry will receive a nice sum of money. If your drawing skills are just average, you will still have the chance to become one of the winners by drawing something funny, clever or innovative.

1st place: $200
2nd place: $150
3rd place: $125
4th place: $100
5th place: $75
6th place: $50
7th place: $30
8th place: $20

The contest ends on (including) Sunday, 26 August 2018. But if you really need a few additional days, I’m open to it.
Since many of you are probably not familiar with the characters, you should check out the following pages:

Please send your entry in an e-mail with the subject “Gaia artwork contest 2018” to novil@gmx.de. You can attach the file to the e-mail or put a link to it in the e-mail’s text body. If you have a website that I should link, please put the link to it into your e-mail as well.
Additional information about the contest:

You can submit several drawings or other types of art, but you can win at most two prizes.
Please do not publish your artwork on other websites before the end of the contest. After that, you can post it anywhere you want.
You can sign your work. But a large, ugly watermark will reduce your chance of winning.
Digital images should be sent in their original size in a lossless format, for example as a PNG file with full color depth. If you draw the image on paper, you should send me a large, clean scan of it in a lossless format, for example as a PNG file with full color depth. However, you can’t attach files larger than 25 MB to your e-mail.

Please ask if you have any questions. But please be aware that I don’t have the time to explain to you in detail all that happened in the comic over the course of the last 7 years.

So this game is (as the title says) Death Race, it is also an exercise in writing for me. So first of all in this race you need a cart so you want to reply to this post with  these criteria:

A cart name
A cart description and racer description/personality (preferably based on a story of yours or one you have in mind but you can do what you want. c:)

OKAY SO HERE IS THE ""TO LONG DIDNT READ VERSION"" OF THESE RULES
YOU HAVE 1000 POINTS!
BASICALLY YOUR GAS!
THE MORE GAS YOU USE THE FASTER YOU GO
THERE ARE ROUNDS SO IF YOU USE 1000 POINTS IN THE FIRST ROUND YOU HAVE 0 IN THE NEXT ROUND
IF YOU USE 500 IN THE FIRST ROUND YOU HAVE 500 THE NEXT ROUND 
IF YOU ARE IN LAST YOU LOSE 
MANAGE YOUR POINTS BASICALLY
YOU WIN WHEN YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON LEFT
YOU CAN WIN ARTWORK OR TAPAS TIP COINS IF YOU HAVE TIPPING ENABLED ON YOUR COMIC OR NOVEL.
THIS CONCLUDES TLDR
So every racer has a finite amount of rp (race points) to power their car at each leg of the race. There are several legs of the race and at each leg you the players need to pm me an RP amount. The more you wager the faster you go. But theirs a catch, at the end of every leg the person in last place gets eliminated. Meaning if you wager the least amount of rp you lose the leg and you are out. But RP doesn't regen so you have to be careful how much you wager so you have enough for later legs.

Each racer starts with 1000 rp.
rp does not regen on its own.
The lowest rp wager is eliminated.
There are rp refunds for coming in the top three each leg.  1st place gets 100 rp back. 2nd gets 50rp and 3rd gets 25rp
Everyone can see where everyone has placed after each leg but i will not reveal the amount of rp wagered ever.
Each leg lasts a maximum of 24 hours. if a racer does not wager in that time it counts as 0 rp wagered. 
If there is a tie for last place it results in a loss for all racers involved in the tie

BUT THERE'S MORE. After the first round there will be little themes i have dreamt up that make it more interesting. For example there might be a round that has an added rule that is something extreme like:
ALL WAGERS ENTERED ARE RANDOMIZED BETWEEN ALL PLAYERS. And then your life is ended because one person wanted to take this chance to wager 1rp :p.  But dont worry i wouldn't do that to you guys. 
After every leg i will write a bit describing what happened to all the racers  in that leg. 
So to that effect the more information you give me about your racer and car the more i can do with them so go all out and ill try my best to be faithful to that 
So really for you guys its an easy game. you check back every 24 hours see what the leg is all about and give me a number. Ill keep track of all the rp as well so you can always ask me how much you have if you dont want to keep track.(But i recommend keeping track).
If you win the the entire thing i would be happy to draw art of your racer, your cart, or any other one thing you might want drawn :p. Or If you have a story on tapas with tipping enabled we can tip you. (10,400 coins). 
Ask all the questions you need to ask!
Also thank your for your time.","['My cart name is SUSHiKart. The cart has sushi rolls for wheels, duh. Instead of gas, it runs on soy sauce. My racer is Wes Sabi, and he is always on top of his game, with perfect scores, but he is always modest and humble about his winnings. He is dedicated to racing his SushiKart, and he also likes to workout in his free time. SushiKart itself is lean and fast, built of protein and carbs to last! No one can beat it, or Wes.', ""My cart name is Soulbound. It's a chestnut colored cart with many intricate carvings and filigree detail. it also has a few sails. It's a very strong, heavy cart and it runs on on the vim, vigor, and will power of it's driver Tora. Soulbound takes a while to get going but once it does it plows through anything in its way, even lifting off the ground and gliding (courtesy of the sails.) if it gets fast enough. Tora is as stubborn and bullheaded as they come she likes to read and tinker with things in her spare time."", ""I love your ideas already guys :D. Thanks for coming to play!\nAlso for you guys or anyone who is interested your cart doesn't have to be a conventional racing cart by any means. I like how stardust decided to have a cart that has sails for gliding. You can have your cart be a car, a motorcycle, a boat that floats and moves with the power of magic, an ostrich or some sort of animal. Anything as long as it moves. sky's the limit. You can also be more detailed with your descriptions if you want or less descriptive just as long as it meets the basic requirements.\nIll say that im looking for a minimum of 5 or six players before im ready to start so keep on the look out and show some forum friends if you want."", ""Alright here goes.\nMy cart name is Edgy Edgerton Edgymaximus the Third, and it is driven by the only human edgy enough to crew such a monstrosity, representing the prose of Broken Pieces, is the amazing, the incredible Adam Sinclair. Adam would enjoy long walks on the beach and a nice book, if enjoyment as a concept wasn't just chemicals in the brain and a silly irrational feeling that was beneath him. Adam also spends his time posting on teenage girl's blogs that their frivolous desires and feelings are stupid, and the enlightened path of Scientology and praising the dark lord satan are the only true charges worth pursuing.\nEdgy Edgerton Edgymaximus the Third is a cart made completely of razor blades, wallet chains and replica anime swords. It has no wheels just ice skate type blades that let this cart SLICE through its opponents. It is a mess of jutting out metal that is not aerodynamic in ANY way but is powered by angst. A quality that its driver does not lack in. My racer is READY."", 'Of course youd do something like this lol @TheNiceGuys.  \nOkay so we only need a few more like 2 to 3 more people. Its  a really simple game just make a character and then day to day you just check back and wager some rp.', 'OKAY SO IM GONNA START THIS UP RIGHT NOW. NEW PEOPLE ARE STILL FREE TO JOIN IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS BUT LETS SHOW EVERYONE HOW DEATH RACE IS DONE.  \n ROUND 1 THE FIRST LEG\n Okay so just to reiterate all of you have 1000 rp. \nYou all must in a private message send me the amount of rp you want to wager for this first round. This rp wager will be subtracted from your 1000 total.\nAfter the 24 hours have passed I will post who came in first second third etc...  along with a little short story describing how i think things would have gone down based on the characters you gave me.

The race was set to start at an arid cliff side area. On the left of the wall was a vertical rock face, and on the right was the long fall below. Wes Sabi stood tall but not as tall as Tora who held herself high with a hearty smile. ""You guys had better go home now, because me and Soulbound absolutely cannot lose"" Tora said confidently.  ""That might be true in the end"" Wes said ""But at the very least ill give you a run for your money"" Wes joked. Adam sighed calling everyone\'s attention to him ""How about we cut all this gross bull**** and get on with it""  With that they all got into their carts and were all ready to race. \n3\n2\n1\nGO!\nThe racers were off. Tora was no slouch and instantly took the lead, Wes and Adam were cloesly behind. Adam looked over at Wes with the grimmest of looks. ""Do you know how it feels?"" Wes Sabi looked to his side watching as Adams bladed vehicle sliced through the race track. The asphalt screamed in agony, the screech was blood curdling. ""I can see it in your eyes. Wes... You dont know what its like to be at the very bottom of the totem pole. Youve never been. Alow me to show you how i feel"" Adam swung the wheel of his creation towards Wes.\n""You are very troubed"" Wes said slamming on the breaks and letting Adams cart STAB into the left wall with its many blades. Adam laughed ""AND YOU ARE SO SCREWED."" Adam slammed on the accelerator ripping the wall apart causing rubble to fly off the wall at the other racers.  At the same time Adam was able to overtake Tora.\nTora smiled weaving through the rubble Adam was creating. ""Something as simple as this"" Tora sped up to Adams side ""No, you cant beat me with this"" Tora looked into Adams eyes. Adam say the raging fire within them. The kind of Fire Adam yearned to SMOTHER. Adam slammed into Tora\'s cart taking it off the edge. Adam laughed maniacally. \nTora was falling to her demise. Her gut sank for a moment, but there was no doubt in her eyes. She would not loose. Not to a guy like that. Her cart filled with the power of her determination. The sails on the side shot out from either side of the cart. Air air beneath its wings lifted it from its hasty decent and back up to the track. As she landed Wes Sabi sped past her waving as he went. Now they had done it. Now she HAD to win\n                                                 **Results!**\n1st Adam + 100 rp\n2nd Wes Sabi + 50rp\n3rd Tora \nBecause we only had 3 players i decided to add a special rule for you guys. You are all allowed to be in last place ONCE and then its kudos to your racer.  So this time it was Tora lets hope she doesn\'t end up in the back again! Also last place wont get a reward.\nIll be back with info on the next round shortly!', 'Second Leg. Dreadnaught Drains. As the racers continue through the track the racers travel through a damp tunnel. Your carts are fast enough to travel on the wall so their are 3 extra dimensions for you here.\nIn addition to your regular rp wager you can give me a number between 1 and 3. If you are in last you have the oppurtunity to pass another racer up if they did not call the same number as you\nFor example Adam comes in first and calls the number 2Wes comes in second and calls 3Tora comes in last and calls 2\nSince wes called three tora can pass him using lane 2 \nBut she cant pass adam since he is blocking that lane. So wes would lose the round as this opourtunity is only offered to the player in last. \nFeel free to ask questions.

While replying to another thread I got thinking about the statistics of Tapas users, specifically their ages. The only thread with this information I could find was from over 2 years ago (https://forums.tapas.io/t/tapastic-demographic-age/11450/828) that said ""The biggest demographic on Tapastic are 13-30 females from America with Gamercat pulling in the most traffic to the site.""
Can we please have a general update on the current users statistics, so authors can know if they're publishing in the right place. If somebody's target audience is 12-16 yo boys for example but the site mainly attracts 20-30 year old women then this will give the authors the chance to decide if this is the site for them.

327,Anime Expo 2019 - Tapas United,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi Creators,
Anime Expo 2018 is less than a month away and we're in preliminary discussions with their sales staff about acquiring exhibit space for 2019.  Unfortunately exhibit hall floor space sells out (~95% sold out) during the convention.  New exhibitors are not allowed to apply for space until 3 pm on the last day.  We will be attending this year in an attempt at getting a space and researching the build out.
AXExhibits.png1060x814 75.4 KB
We would like to use the space in 2019 to promote Tapas for the benefit of all creators using the platform.  This would be an unofficial undertaking with the goal of creating enough success that staff will take over in 2020.
We're looking for volunteers who would be interested in helping staff the space.  The exhibit hall is open for 9 hours the first day, 8 hours the second and third, and 5 hours the last day.  Volunteers would receive a weekend badge in return for their assistance.  While it is possible to fly solo, we would prefer to have two or more individuals always at the booth to help field questions and talk up the platform.
AXDemographics.png1054x872 90.1 KB
In addition we would like to put together a gratis newsprint comic filled with 12 or so 4-page series samples.  2018 convention estimates are for 450,000 turnstile and 115,000 unique attendees.  Estimating that approximately 10% of attendees take home a copy, we would need to print approximately 10,000 copies.  We are waiting on a response back from a small press about piggybacking on their commercial runs in order to keep the print costs as low as possible.  We will also attempt to find advertisers to take out space in the comic book to further reduce costs.  However, the creators who are featured in the book would need to financially contribute to the undertaking.
AxProgramGuidePricing.png1100x962 704 KB
As you can see from the EMO pricing, participating in AX is very expensive.
This would be a unique opportunity for a creator to reach tens of thousands of new readers for a fraction of the cost of doing something similar on their own.

AXImpressions.png1054x512 17.5 KB
Depending on the creators who show interest, and how large their followings are, we would also consider hosting meet-and-greets for fans at the space.  Additionally, depending on print run costs and transactional logistics, it may be possible for creators to do signings of newsprint runs of their series, if they are willing to front the expenses related to the run.
In closing we're trying to gauge community interest in this sort of endeavor.  If you are interested in participating in one form or another, let us know.

(We will periodically bump this post until the convention and daily during the convention.)","['@375 Want to spend an unbearable amount of time with me in a car and volunteer?', 'how does this all work..?', ""I'd love to!  Volunteering is something I enjoy doing <3"", 'Going all out for the big one, eh?Before seeing that there were already talks going on about space for next year, I was going to suggest Comikaze (LA Comic Con) which also occupies the Los Angeles Convention Center - as it might be easier acquire a spot.This sounds like a neat idea, though.', ""Heya STAFF, can you provide a few more details?  I'm interested in making the trip."", ""@375 and @ISNEKO thank you for your interest in volunteering!\n\nghostieblu:\nhow does this all work..?\nIt's hard to answer a question so broad.  More specifically, what would you like to know?\n\n\neochoa92:\nGoing all out for the big one, eh?\nWe ran the numbers and the CPM goes down the larger the convention gets, even though exhibiting fees rise.  For example, the CPM for a regional convention like SacAnime is 2x that of Anime Expo even though the exhibiting fees are 1/4th the cost.\nCoupled with fixed costs like transportation and housing, it makes more sense to go a national event unless you are in very close proximity to a regional convention, which we are not.\nThe top three national conventions in the US are New York Comic Con, San Diego Comic Con, and Anime Expo.  Both NYCC and SDCC have serious issues with housing/lodging expenses.  Anime Expo still has reasonable room rates available even though it's less than a month away.  Plus LAX offers lots of direct flights.  SAN does not.\nAnother critical issue is shipping the booth to AX.  If we have to POV it (some conventions do not allow freight-in shipping), AX is a 10 hour drive.  That puts NYCC out of the question.\n\n\nleecomics:\nHeya STAFF, can you provide a few more details?\nThis is an unofficial volunteer event.  Tapas staff isn't involved.  They are welcome to be, but we don't anticipate their help.\nWhat specific details can we help clarify?"", 'I wanna know how people are gonna participate in it, and the rules or something. also how much does it cost?', 'We are finishing up a FAQ.  That may help.  If you still have questions, fire away!', 'Based on the questions we are receiving here are some FAQs.  We will update them as things change.\nFAQs\nComic Book Questions:\n1) What are the stats for the sampler?\nWorking Title: TAPAS #0Pages: 56Binding: SaddleCover: 60# Gloss TextInterior: 32# Hibrite\n2) What if my series is read right-to-left?\nTo accommodate both left-to-right and right-to-left series, TAPAS #0 will be split, with a unique cover on each side. Left-to-right series will make up the front portion and right-to-left will make up the back portion.  Each cover will be shown at the space to increase attendee attraction.\n3) How many comics are currently signed up to participate?\nFour.\n4) How many comics will be allowed?\nTAPAS #0 has room for twelve 4-page series samples.  The remaining pages will be used for a platform introduction/awareness page, a credits page, and advertisements.  Advertisements will be sold to help reduce participation prices.\n5) What happens if there are more than twelve comics who would like to participate?\nIf we reach enough interest we may split things into a TAPAS #0 and a TAPAS #1.  This may actually lower participation costs further since advertisers will be willing to pay more for a print run of 20,000 vs. 10,000.\nSampler Participation Questions:\n1) How much will it cost to participate?\nMany things are in flux right now, including print costs, which make up the majority expense.  We will make every attempt to keep costs down to help as many creators as possible.  Our current ""worst case scenario"" pricing is $450 per series.\n2) Where is the money going from the participation fees?\nPrinting, exhibition fees, shipping/freighting, booth decoration (""build out"") expenses, labor union load-in/load-out fees, general liability insurance, and weekend badges for volunteers to staff the booth.\n3) When will final pricing be determined?\nFebruary 1, 2019.\n4) When will payment be due?\nMarch 1, 2019.\n5) When will all art be due?\nMarch 18, 2019.\n6) How do I sign up to participate as a series sample?\nJust let us know via a reply here or private message.  While we realize this is a year away and plans do change, only sign up if you are highly certain that you can participate.\n7) I would like to participate but I cannot afford a 4-page position.\nWe will be offering ¼, ½, and full page ads in the sampler.  Pricing will be announced at a later date.  Additionally if you would like to sponsor a special gratis take away at the booth such as a series postcard or bookmark, let us know via private message and we will work with you on an individual basis.\nExhibiting Questions:\n1) Where will the space be?  What size?  What configuration?\nMain exhibition hall.  10\'x10\' or 10\'x20\' pending space needs based on creator demand.  We will attempt to have at least one corner, pending availability.  We will attempt to be as close to the front and center of the hall for maximum impact, pending availability.\n2) Will you be selling anything at the space?\nIf a creator wishes to open a dialogue about doing a newsprint run of their own series and selling it at the space they may contact us.  However the creator must be in attendance at the convention to sell it themselves.  The primary focus of this event is to promote Tapas for the benefit of all creators using the platform.\n3) Will Premium series be featured at the space?\nUnless Premium series pay to participate in TAPAS #0, our goal will be to promote free-to-read series.\n4) Will Tapas staff be involved?\nThis is an unofficial community event.  At this time, Tapas Media is not participating.\nVolunteer Questions:\n1) How do I sign up to volunteer?\nJust let us know via a reply here or private message.  While we realize this is a year away and plans do change, only sign up if you are highly certain that you can participate.\n2) How many have volunteered?  Is there a limit?\nWe have three volunteers so far.  There is currently no limit as we want to be able to split the workload such that volunteers can have time off to enjoy Anime Expo on their own and make some wonderful memories!\n3) How are volunteers expected to behave?\nProfessionally, as you are representing the entire community.  You are Tapas Ambassadors!  If there are any incidents, it will be held against us by the convention staff, and may ban us from ever doing anything like this again.\n4) Will volunteers receive reimbursement for transportation, lodging, food, etc.?\nUnfortunately no.  Volunteer creators are welcome however to pitch their own series while talking up the platform in general to attendees.\n5) Is Golden Plume Comics receiving a ""management fee""?\nNo.  We\'re doing this fully volunteer to keep costs as low as possible for creators.  This is an event ""For the Community, by the Community"".', 'does the page sample cost $450?', '\nghostieblu:\ndoes the page sample cost $450?\nYes, a 4-page series sample is currently priced at $450.  This is ""worst case"" pricing.  We are undertaking several options to help reduce costs further and will keep everyone apprised to pricing improvements as they occur.\n$450 to have 4 full pages in a 10,000 issue run with 450,000 exposure is far below market value.  This is because of collective buying power and all the volunteer hours being donated.', 'In light of the shutdown announcement for Project Wonderful, giving this thread a bump.', ""Hey @GoldenPlume can you give me a PM? My team is seriously considering this and we'd love any additional details. Interested in specific numbers on sample book cost and curious where you're looking for printing. We may have some avenues for lower cost printing on our end."", '\n\nKamikaze:\ncan you give me a PM?\nSo no one following the thread is left wondering, we sent one. ', '@GoldenPlume I might be interested in volunteering at the booth!', ""\n\nviolin:\nI might be interested in volunteering\nGreat!  That's much appreciated.\nWe're still in discussions with all the creators who wish to be involved.  In order to help cover the costs, since there is  not going to be enough creators participating at the $450 level, the space is going to be part promotion of the platform (for the benefit of all creators) as well as individual creators selling their Tapas series in print."", ""@GoldenPlume Also in regards to the costs... assuming 10% of attendees will take home something seems like a lot to me, considering how huge AX is and a large number of attendees may never even come across the booth.\nHave you considered more cost effective alternatives, such as printing only 1,000 physical copies and hosting a webpage promo, where for example people can beam a QR code w their phones to arrive at the website which features beautiful, responsive previews of multiple series and links to Tapas itself? I imagine it will be MUCH cheaper to print 10,000 little QR code stickers that maybe have a line or two of promotional text than to print that many copies of the book, some of which may be discarded if you're handing them out for free... Also on a website you can host many more previews without much change in upfront cost and get more creators involved\nEDIT: Additional idea - you can also host some sort of small giveaway and require people to tweet links to the promo site to win, with specific #AX related hashtags. This would automatically expose people who aren't even physically present to see the content"", '@violin we\'re most likely going to make some changes to the sampler as in reducing page count and quantity.  We\'re not sure if it will be as few as 1,000.  That is one percent of the attendance.\n\n\nviolin:\nattendees may never even come across the booth\nAs far as booth location if the only availability is a far back corner of the hall that will have minimal traffic we may decline to exhibit.  The benefit of being at the convention in person is that we can actually look at the space before leasing it.\n\n\nviolin:\nHave you considered more cost effective alternatives\nWe\'re open to and considering many alternatives.  Feel free to fire off all the ideas you can.\nAs far as the splash page, what did you have in mind regarding a ""responsive preview""? \n\n\nviolin:\nyou can also host some sort of small giveaway\nWe were planing on doing that with the prize being a large number of Tapas coins.\nThanks for all the suggestions and keep them coming! ', ""splash page maybe something like this:\n\nexcept instead of those lovely photos you could feature promotional splash art by creators themselves. since it's a website you could even go one step further and when creators click on one they can actually expand and view the prologue chapter of the actual webcomic, with links to Tapas below etc\nby responsive I was referring to it resizes automatically and doesn't look like crap on mobile.  but it shouldn't be very hard to throw together something like that with some premade Wordpress or Ghost themes""]",6/8/2018 20:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

330,Gauging Interest? – TAPASTIC #0 Comic Book,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi Everyone,
A common desire among many creators is finding new ways of increasing the reach/readership of their series.  
One place where many comic readers consolidate at are comic cons, offering not only a very efficient targeted marketing approach, but also a readership we have found to be largely untapped.  To give you some idea of scale, San Diego Comic Con is one of the largest in the United States, with an approximate attendance of 140,000.
Currently, we're in the preliminary phases of planning a possible printing of a TAPASTIC #0 comic book.  The comic would be an anthology/sampler of up to 14 4-page color comics by Tapas creators printed on newsprint.  Here's an example:The comic would be saddle bound, with a 60# cover and 32# interior pages, essentially the same as comic books back in the 90s.  By using newsprint, printing costs can be kept to a reasonable amount.
These comics would then be distributed gratis at conventions, reaching thousands of new readers.
While the associated costs in doing such would be immense for a single creator, if many joined together, the individual expense would go down dramatically.  The question is, how many creators are willing to invest money into promoting their own series?
We've already done a significant amount of legwork associated with such an endeavor.  It works out to approximately $120/page for 10,000 copies distributed at a single regional convention with 25,000 attendance.  Of course as more copies are printed the cost per page goes down and more conventions can be attended, but for now we just want to gauge what interest, if any, there would be in such a project.
Comic books get about 2.5 views per copy, as friends and family share, so the total reach would be 25,000 potential new readers for all the series that participate.
There is also an option to create a variant cover with an issue price of $1.99 that creators could sell on their own however they like.  The books would be sold at cost (~$.40) and creators would be able to keep their individual profits, if the group as a whole agreed to that arrangement.
Ideally we would love to take this idea even bigger than 10k copies at a single convention, but first we need to find out if anyone would be interested in participating.
Best!-Golden Plume Comics","['Sounds like a great idea to me. But when you say interested in participating, how does one participate? Do you mean buying space? That would be ~$500? Am I reading that right?', 'Yes, you would have to buy space.  A four page comic would be $480, unless we can find other revenue to offset the cost to print, ship, and distribute.  One option would be to sell the inside front, inside back, and back cover as ad space, if sponsors can be found.  Right now though we\'re pricing things as ""worst case"".\nAlso, costs go down as the number of copies rises, but we had to pick somewhere to start so we decided on 10,000 copies.\nOne thing to keep in mind, if a creator could sell 300 variant copies on their own, their cost would be $0 ($2 - $.40 = $1.60 x 300 = $480).  So individual true cost can range quite a bit.\nThere\'s a lot of ways this can go and be even larger scale and even more successful, we\'re just trying to gauge interest before investing serious time in something even larger.', 'Your professionalism makes me wish I made comics.', 'I like the idea as a creator! Not sure if I could afford a full 4 pages at that rate, but I could definitely do a 2 page mini comic for that. I love the idea at the very least.', ""I'd be interested!Tbh, I really love this idea and I'd actually buy one of these if I had the chance.\nI do have a few questions: 1. if people outside of the States wish to participate, would international shipping of the issues be possible?2. What would the lowest price be, if you'd only wish to get a certain amount of copies? (Say, less than 300? for the variant issues)(I probably have more questions, but these are the ones that I got when I read the post)\nThinking as one single indie artist creator, I think $480 is a bit too much for my economy, even tho I understand that it'll be able to reach far much more people than I could possibly imagine (I also understand the worst case scenario, and it'd be lower the less pages you buy).If the price had been lower, I'd jump in less than a heart beat to the opportunity!"", ""I doubt I'd be able to afford it right now either, but I still think it's a great idea. I hope to see more people hop on board so it comes to fruition!"", ""120 $ to buy a page? I think it's a bit too much expensive. But good luck with the project!"", ""\n\nsarrowsmith10:\nbut I could definitely do a 2 page mini comic\nThat's something that certainly seems doable.\n\n\nChopythes:\nif people outside of the States wish to participate, would international shipping of the issues be possible?\nInternational shipping is possible, unfortunately it is very expensive.  While there are multiple international carriers available in the United States (USPS, UPS, and FedEx) only the USPS is within reason.  Their international flat rate padded envelope can ship 4 lbs (about 20 comics) for $31.  Takes about 2 weeks.  Smaller parcels can sent for around $13 as first class mail at a speed of about 4 to 6 weeks.\nWe're fully willing to international ship, as long as everyone is aware of the time and cost.\n\n\nChopythes:\nWhat would the lowest price be, if you'd only wish to get a certain amount of copies? (Say, less than 300? for the variant issues)\nIf you aren't a creator and are simply buying a large quantity of copies as if a retailer (e.g. comic book shop), the industry standard is 50% to 60% off the cover price.  So a $2 cover would translate into $.80 to $1 a copy.\nCreators would get copies at cost, $.40.  They could order as many or as few copies as they desire.\nThe goal for this is to be revenue neutral.  Any extra money would be put towards more copies and more conventions attended.\n\n\nChopythes:\nThinking as one single indie artist creator, I think $480 is a bit too much for my economy\nConsidering the costs just to attend a convention, artist alley/hotel/travel, $480 is excellent value.  We're not even considering our own time spent, travel, or lodging, instead opting to give that away for the good of the community.  We just want to break even on printing, shipping, and exhibiting.\n\n\nzoonland:\n120 $ to buy a page?\nA full page ad with the next comparable thing, Alterna Comics, is $100 and the print run is approximately 7,000.  This print run is 10,000, so the price is below market rates.\n\n\nalternacomics.com\n\n\n\nAlterna Comics - Advertise\nAdvertise your business, product, or service in our comic books!\n\n\n\n\n\n"", '\n\nGoldenPlume:\nConsidering the costs just to attend a convention, artist alley/hotel/travel, $480 is excellent value.  We\'re not even considering our own time spent, travel, or lodging, instead opting to give that away for the good of the community.  We just want to break even on printing, shipping, and exhibiting.\nOh, I absolutely understand this part. I didn\'t mean that it was expensive in terms of the print, shipping, legwork et cetera. Tbh, I think it\'s a bit too cheap?? I mean, considering all the work you\'re gonna have to do with putting it all together and such with such a large audience, it\'s a good price.\nMy thoughts are: ""Would I benefit from this in the long run?"" And to that question no one can really answer until it\'s been done! \nI absolutely love this idea, and I hope it\'ll get lots of more people joining in. Thanks for answering my questions<3', ""\n\nChopythes:\nTbh, I think it's a bit too cheap?\nActually you are right.  It is too cheap.  We're losing out on a ton on time invested putting it together and then spending 3 8-hour days at a convention, plus travel and lodging expenses, getting it into the hands of readers.  \nThis is something we want to do to help creators and Tapas.  It's a huge win for everyone involved.\nBut if there's not enough interest... then it is what it is.""]",5/18/2018 14:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
331,Dear Creators at Tapas,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello guys,
I want to hear your opinions before we build a new thing for Tapas creators. Here is a screenshot of a prototype creators page.
creatorsview.png862x1754 259 KB

This is not a final version of screen we will build. Again, It's just a concept screen(So please ignore design stuffs) I(I haven't share this with all of tapas team members yet so I can't say ""we"".. haha) want to build it. In this view, I hope Tapas users can find awesome creators as much as they can using this view. This view includes when you started publishing at Tapas, your name, avatar image, series, total episode view count, subscriber count and tipper count. I guess noticeable things are a simple quote/bio that you want to present(say) to Tapas users and  creator's ""Badge"". 
I'm not totally sure you like the creator's badge also I didn't define what badges we would have.. but I want to know it works for you conceptually. Also if you guys have any ideas for the new badge please feel free to give suggestions. 
If most of them don't like this view, I could drop this view but I think maybe it's a good opportunity that Tapas could help Tapas users meet/connect with our creators. 
Any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated!Thank you,","[""I love how you're interacting with members, seriously!"", 'I honestly like the design! And also love how you interact with users!', ""This seems interesting. It's a great way to discover new creators."", 'I really like the thought of this! Great idea!', ""I like this, as well! Though, is the badge in the picture? I'm having a hard time finding it."", 'So forgive me if I’m slow, but is it just a list of creators, or a messaging system? Because the ap could use some kind of private messaging similar to the desktop. \nRegardless, happy to see staff asking the forum for thoughts. It does look nice. ', ""gotta click to view the whole image, think the badges are rookie, premium and legendary?\nI'm kinda curious what would determine how you earn a certain badge. Like if it's a system similar to the forums or are there other factors like how it shows whos a premium creator.\n\n\nSleepingPoppy:\nsome kind of private messaging similar to the desktop.\nI'd love that. I feel bad not being able to reach out to the mobile users"", 'If there is a badges system, it would be more fun to let all users able to get them. Or else it would seems a bit too much like... competitive ranking system?\nFor example, different badges for participation in a particular event - (es. March writer competition 2018; tipping event, Xmas collaboration etc.)\nThere might be badges titles for readers (es. ""100 comics in the library"" - Avid reader; ""1000 likes"" - a comic lover; ""50 share"" - Sharing love around) \nOr badges for the contributors in tipping (""5000 coins tipped"" - Generous giver, ""10 000"" - A wonderful human being etc).\nIt would makes a fun environment, badges distribution as thanks, for collections etc. They usually help to encourage more participation. Just an idea.', 'I support this all the way (*´∀｀)', 'Great idea so far =) Although I can\'t use the mobile app (have neither apple nor android) I think it\'s a good thing.\nI have a question though: If a creator has more than one series - will it be possible to choose which one will be the ""main"" series and displayed in this screen?\nLike in the example pic: ""Dungeon Construction Co."" - can the creator choose which series will be displayed or will it be determined by latest upload etc? =)', 'Thank you for the kind words and suggestions. Again the prototype above is just a concept page so we hasn\'t decided anything yet. So I believe the final design of the badge system is very up to our creators. I\'m thinking the initial version badges would determine some stats data that creators have (view count / subscribers count / etc..). Then I\'ll hear you guys opinions once we have the first version of badge system then keep improving. it\'s because I\'d like to build it as soon as I can. I\'ll keep listening our creators opinions for this view because it\'s not for me it\'s for our creators. \n\n\nLaht:\n\nFor example, different badges for participation in a particular event - (es.

By default, I think most subscribers series... but any suggestions are always welcome.\nThanks, All!', '@Yoon: I like the approach of the most subscribers series =) But I was thinking what if I had a new series (=0 subscribers) and finished my old series (=1000 subscribers) - then I personally would love to choose the new series so that people can see ""Oh, there is a new series from my favorite creator, gotta check that out"" =) This is why I was asking about the choosing option, so thank you very much for your kind and quick response! =)', 'Kind of "" I dunno""...while I like the design & format, I gotta wonder if the side labels on the right(premium, legend, rookie) will affect reads...', ""Yeah you're right but maybe I believe our readers can find awesome creators easily?! Crossed fingers! haha"", 'seems very tasty! And thank you, really, for hearing us!!!!', 'Honestly I really like it!  It shows all the basic info, even if that person is a premium creator or not', ""And I agree with @Yoon, it'll make finding people so much easier "", 'Are there going to be sort or search options built in to find creators?', 'i don’t reeeally understand the purpose of this  you can just find a creator by clicking the author of the comic you like, and that’s how i would find people and want them to find me. i would rather there be a notifications feed on mobile so creators can see our likes, comments and subs on the app.\nperhaps it would be more useful if tapas were a place where multiple people worked on a single comic and you want to be able to find a particular colourist and all the things they’ve worked on etc. a page to find creators, when the whole app is already about finding comics made by individuals, seems like a bit of a redundant feature.']",3/14/2018 15:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's one of, if not the most exciting thing that has happened in the time i've been making comics.It also makes me feel very lucky, i constantly see people on the forums give up for not getting any readers, even after years of hard work and dedication, i'm glad i was able to find an audience which keeps me motivated to making.
But that's not really the point of this post, the real purpose, as you might have guessed, to tell everyone about the art raffle i'm holding for my subscribers (and to brag a little).
And what's the raffle about? After getting three winners, i'll get personally in contact with them to get their characters or any charcter they like with any of the charcters of the comic together on a nice little art piece, just for them.

336,How do different comic or novel writers get their ideas from?,Events | Challenges,[],"When I read comics or novels, sometimes the ideas are very interesting that makes me wonder where they got it from. I was just curious to know, how people got their ideas from.","['Oh, I could go on for a long time on this one x). But I\'ll be brief.\nMythologia (G | S) - I love Greek mythology, but hate most modern interpretations. So, I decided to write my own. The stories range from wholly original to interpretations of specific myths, but I endeavor to keep the Classical character and history of the featured figures intact.\nSanguine - I asked my co-worker if she\'d turn her husband into a vampire if she was a vampire herself. I also ranted to the same co-worker about how weird it is that higher beings (angels, aliens, vampires) always want to bang humans (""like I human wanting to bang a chimp,"" I said). The two ideas merged with inspiration from The Witcher 3\'s ""Blood and Wine"" expansion to create the concept of a world of true immortals who farm humans and bang no one xD.\nCall Me Mara1 - Originally a spin-off of an idea I got from musing to my co-worker (yes, that same co-worker) about a utopia created by the perfect rule of a perfect ruler. It was a seed that grew into a much larger tale, and in the original telling, Mara was an ancient King remembered mostly for some dark stuff. I decided to tell her story for the Writers Camp instead of writing the original tale, and as a result, the way I plan to tell the latter has changed entirely.\nIn short, all of my stories start from a single seed: an interesting thought. I fill in the world over time via interesting conversations, inspiration from stories I\'ve enjoyed, and observations about the state of the world or tropes in fiction, and a new character or world is born. Honestly, it\'s usually the part of the process I love the most .', 'Alot of Times Ideas form vased on interest. I have maybe three different stories based around Fairytales and two around space aliens. Because those are my big old interest. And I know more about those topics than if i made a slice of life comic about working at an office.\nBuuut. Specifically. \nStorytale was inspired and invented when in college our class was assigned a specific fairytale to both character design, set design, and then storyboard a scene. In the middle of the project i trailed off to think about what happened to these characters after the story is over. Which eventually evolved into what it is now.\nI don’t remember where the others came from. Probably fanfic in my head i wanted to make original and removed everything that would of made it fanficy. Or a dream i do dream up alotvof stories.', ""try taking a dump and think about life, that's where i got most of my story."", 'I just ask myself what would be interesting, not really ground breaking but it works =L', ""I got my idea from everywhere and anywhere. I have a whole binder book full of my prompt, which is, sadly, just an undeveloped prompt waiting for my lazy self to bring to the world to see.\nIf you ask me where to get my idea, I could only said: imagination.I can get my idea just by sitting and thinking some random stuff (whatever it is) and will come up with some idea out of nowhere.Sometimes I have a shower thought and I ended up getting a prompt for a story.Sometimes I read or watch something interesting and I ended up having a new idea with an influence of the things I read and watch.\nRidiculously enough I once making a story line of a story to ended up realizing it have the similar plotline as The Uninvited (I honestly doesn't even realize of how similar my prompt is with the d*mn movie), and if I don't wanna get the label of 'plagiarism', I need to change it in the future if I want to use the story idea.\nBut if you think about it, 'original' story line is hard to find in a book or tv nowadays. I remembered reading somewhere that the very original plotline is only seven kind (I think its seven?) before it got more diverse by using the original seven plotline to make other stories with the original in mind."", ""My ideas tend to start off as one thing and evolve into something entirely different. Sometimes I might see a picture or a show and an Idea will pop up that way or I'll be sitting at my desk at work and BAM!

When that character in that movie did something dumb, you think ""they should\'ve done X instead!"" You can go ""wow plothole"" or you can write an entire story about a scenario where a character does X instead when put in a similar situation, and how that might change the outcome of everything, for good or ill.\nGetting ideas is just a matter of seeing things and thinking a step beyond them. A friend and I once saw a guy walk by us on the sidewalk with a parrot on his shoulder, and we joked he was a Land Pirate, and I immediately started pondering what kind of society a land pirate might have, what being a land pirate might entail, how could you make this society of free, wandering vagabonds that feel like fantasy pirates but live in a suburb.I didn\'t do anything with this thought, and I think that\'s another part of it -- it\'s not as though you get struck by One Really Good Idea and that\'s the story you make; it\'s more like, you keep making ideas out of everything and eventually some of them are interesting enough that you do the work to mash them into the shape of a story.', 'My ideas come from classic cartoons, trippy dreams I keep having, and childhood videogames. I also get some ideas from movie or video game soundtracks. \nThe classic cartoons mostly inspired the design and feel of my comics and drawings, and each of what I\'ve made and posted here (and other websites I\'m on), is my personal love letter to the works\' that I\'ve kept fond memories of and still revisit every once in a while even if they don\'t make a comeback in recent time, or if I haven\'t watched/followed said program in a decent amount of time.\nChildhood Videogames are something that has never gone away. Heck, the loads of games that came out during the PS2/Xbox/GameCube era (along with alot of 1990s PC games, mostly from Disney; as well as some Playstation 1 games that have lingered their way into my collection like Spongebob Supersponge and Spiderman PS1) are what fueled much of my adventure novels. Just the spirit of adventure these games brought whether they were a collect-a-thon, a linear platformer, the Prince of Persia, a racing game, an action-racing game, a licensed game or movie game (like A Bug\'s Life, Toy Story 2, Star Wars, The Simpsons Road Rage and Hit & Run, Batman: Vengeance or Fairly Oddparents or Tak & The Power of Juju). Not to mention videogame franchises like Crash Bandicoot are stuff that says, ""Hey, it\'s cool to make loony adventure stories."" My youtube playlist is filled with a lot game soundtracks based on the games I\'ve played early on, or CLASSIC games I\'ve discovered recently and got hooked on them (even when they\'re ones that don\'t age well.)\nMovies are in a similar boat to the classic cartoons panel. There\'s some movies that have stuck with me forever like Batman: Mask of the Phantasm & Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Scooby-Doo (mainly the Zombie Island quadrology), especially Pixar movies from Toy Story all the way to The Incredibles and Up and even Cars. Toy Story has been a starting point for some of the comics/novels I have that include a dynamic duo in a sense, and has been the main inspiration for me throughout the series\' existence. Animated movies aren\'t the only inspiration for there includes a good fair share of live-action movies too, like the original Spider-Man trilogy, The Stupids, Roll Bounce, Star Wars in some places, Holes, Sky High, Max Keeble\'s Big Move, and quite a few more.\nCartoon & Movie & Videogame Soundtracks - As I\'ve stated in the videogames panel, I have a playlist full of soundtracks from the games I\'ve loved. But I also have ones based on movies and cartoons. The one that\'s most obvious and used quite a good amount of times is the Spongebob soundtrack from the television show. However, I like to go a step further and listen to songs from the movies (and I don\'t just mean the official soundtracks. I go for the actual orchestral score). I was always fond of funny characters going on big journeys, or having a big event.\nThe PPG Movie - The Powerpuff Girls (This is one of my favorites, as well as enjoying this movie).\n\nIt\'s something you don\'t get as often anymore, not even as a TV special. Maybe it\'s cause of how intensive it takes to make something like this, or maybe because its easy to watch/read user-created works online that it kinda defeats the purpose of big-movies based on properties? Maybe its how they\'re adapted? I don\'t know, but I do kinda miss this. I know there\'s direct-to-DVD movies like the aforementioned Scooby-Doo, but sometimes its not the same.\nThe orchestral themes in movie soundtracks, or those kinds that are quiet, gently funny, pensive, endearing, or calm-before-the-storm are the sounds I like to listen to when I\'m writing chapters. Songs with flutes, bassoons, or clarinets that bring a sly feeling to a situation are my most favorite when writing because it brings a sense that someone\'s got an idea, but they\'re having trouble properly planning it out. Sometimes, though, those songs can\'t be found via soundtrack alone and instead is from a YouTube video or cartoon I\'m watching. (I end up rewinding back the same part over and over just for the song, and as a consequence I guess, I end up memorizing the scene that I\'m rewinding back and forth. It\'s kinda funny as I end up mimicking the lines afterward. And now... some memorized lines:\n ""You\'ll get your rent when you fix this DAMN DOOR!"" ~ Spider-man 3\n""You did good children... very good indeed~"" / ""Now what do we do?!"" - The Powerpuff Girls Movie\n""I looked death right in the eye... and it smelled like cheap cigars and stinkyfish"" - Ren & Stimpy\n""I\'ll teach you to swindle my idiot sidekick!"" - Ren & Stimpy\nOh, what? Whaaaaaaaat? These are plastic! He can\'t fly. Toy Story\n""Bullseye, you don\'t wanna go with me! They\'ll put you back into storage if they find you, so just go!"" - Toy Story 2\nYUUU-AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!! - Mike Wazowski\'s scream from Monster\'s Inc.\n""Friends are there....  to help you get started! To give you a push on your waaaaaayyyy!"" - Garfield & Friends\n""I can do this... it\'s just a bird, right?!""  - A Bug\'s Life: The Video Game\n""Welcome to your grave, Suckers!"" - The Simpsons Arcade Game\n""Woo-hoo-hoo! Jane stop this crazy thing! Hahaha!"" - Ed, Edd n Eddy\n""Jinkies!"" / GRRRAAARRRRHHH!! / ""Jinkies... Jinkies, isn\'t that a breakfast cereal or something?"" - Bravo Dooby Doo\n""So  here\'s the deal. You help me find my missing parts, and we\'re in business!"" - Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.\n""Vishnu! Here I come!"" / ""Thank you for not dodging!"" / ""Ey, move it whitey!"" / ""Damn it! I dropped my kabob!"" / ""He used a cheat code!"" / ""I blame society"" / ""Ow! My neck!"" / ""Oowww, my ass!"" / ""Ow, my head!"" - The Simpsons Hit & Run\n_""Come to daddy."" / ""Boom!!! I\'m back, dummy!"" / ""Take your lumps like a MAN, Private Twinkletoes!"" / ""I\'m gonna beat you like a rented mule, boy"" / drunken noises _  - Team Fortress 2\nBee-doh! / No... no annoying sounds... / No, I said Cookie robots. Cookie ROBOTS! Why, why do you have to be so... old...?"" - Despicable Me\n""I did it! I feel five years younger! Ooohhh, it\'s good to be back!"" / ""And he starts sucking on the glaaaass!"" / ""See anything yet, Patrick? / ""I need my glasses."" / ""HAM-mer! Dah-I get it!"" / ""Somehow, I don\'t think he needs a hand!"" / ""Nothin\' but a little MAN-type stuff!"" / ""Look ooouuut! Look OUUTT!!"" / ""Neptune, I command you to kill SPONGEBOB!"" / ""Alright, Krabs! Time for you to die!"" / ""By the way, Patrick... when was the last time you took a bath?"" - Spongebob\nI\'m gonna stop there for now because this list will get long in the tooth! But a thumbs up and a high-five for you if any of these quotes suddenly reinvigorate your memories! These are just the things that have been my inspiration, and the lines I memorize when I listen for the music.', ""I probably get inspired more by music than anything else. I just let the music animate images in my brain and suddenly I get a character, or I get a scene, or a plot. All my story ideas usually start with the characters, and the tone of the music I'm listening to dictates whether it's going to be a fantasy, a romance, or science fiction story. \nOf course I pull some ideas off of my favorite shows, and other media as well."", 'An awesome explanation and I love that picture. It sums everything up! ', ""\nWhen I watch/read/play something and I like some concepts in it i think how to use bits of it in my works.\nWhile listening to music I imagine stuff and sometimes get ideas for whole scenes that way.\nWhen I need help with my story I talk to my friend an we have a brainstorm together.\nWhen I'm in bed and I can't fall asleep.\nWhen I have too much time to think. xD (shower, bath, toilet, public transport...)\n"", 'My stories are basically a jigsaw puzzle of everything I\'ve seen, experienced, and dreamt about in my life. They\'re probably a more accurate picture of me than the body and face people see walking around every day.\nThat can include stuff like a particularly interesting shadow on the wall or a fold in the laundry that looks like a face, or patterns in the fake marble in the shower. Dreams are a huge HUGE source of my ideas and I keep a notebook handy by the bed to extensively transcribe them whenever I can. And then yes, all of the books I read that moved me, all the movies I\'ve watched and games I\'ve played. Even conversations I\'ve had with friends, where they suggested something that maybe wasn\'t a good fit but then it made me think of something that was.\nAs was said up-thread, far and away the most important thing is to spend a lot of time thinking about the things you\'ve seen. This is how something that was not yours, becomes yours. A sunset and an odd cloud configuration, or a soap commercial for that matter, are both things that you did not make but after they have been simmering inside you for a long time, they can become something new and unique that you made.\nTo my mind this is the only real way to combat ""there is nothing new under the sun."" What is new has to come out of you and it has to be made from what has already existed.', ""From everywhere and nowhere. \nFor me it's conversations with family and friends, personal experiences and such.But then there's also mythology, folklore, books, movies, other comics, role play, LARP or PnP, just other stories in general.Things that fascinates me but I don't know about, so I want to know more, or an issue I don't understand and want to explore. (It rhymes so it must be true!)\nThe Changeling's Sister is mostly inspired by PnP, folklore and personal experience."", ""When I was younger I discovered this animation app on my dsi and when I listened to songs I liked I would try to plan out an animation in my head to the music, and it kind of stuck as habit and I still do the same sometimes and that's how I get some of my ideas.\nI came up with Strange Tides, my most read novel on Wattpad, when I saw a book cover on Instafreebie with the silhouette of a sea serpent on it, and I decided I wanted to write about a sea serpent too. From that one thought I've built an entire world that I can write dozens of novels about if I wanted to.\nRetribution, the first story I actually finished, I came up with after hearing about women in war who went out and pushed back the enemy because something happened to their husbands. I guess it's a bit of a love letter?\nThe idea for Music Battlers, the longform comic I'm scripting right now, was actually a joke. My boyfriend and I were joking about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and what if you could use stands with meme music, and we kept going back to the joke until we came up with something with real potential and characters based off of us and our girlfriend as the main three.\nSo yeah, ideas come from everywhere!"", ""write about what you know, what you lived, your passion, what you like to research...don't write about living in new york if you live in africa, for example.""]",4/12/2018 6:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
337,Tapas Blocking Feature for Creators,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey everyone! 
When we first started this journey creating Tapas, we tried our best to cultivate a healthy, positive community to celebrate the arts. For the most part, I believe we have done a good job at working behind the scenes to talk to readers and creators about one of our core beliefs: there's never a wrong time to be polite. 
However, as the community has grown over the years, we've found ourselves in the difficult predicament of not being able to patrol and protect the community as often as we would like. It became evident that larger scale solutions were necessary in order to help protect and empower creators from any kind of toxicity they didn't want to face for whatever reasons on Tapas. 
Mental health, safety, and security are all deeply personal things, and there's no one way to go about ensuring that creators feel safe and comfortable publishing with us and putting their work in front of the Tapas community. We’ve individually deleted our fair share of comments from the community, but as an editor, I've come across a number of comments that have been reported that I personally felt weren't offensive. However, I soon realized it wasn't my place to deem what is and what isn't offensive to any one creator--I have no idea what the creator is personally experiencing and what triggers may be embedded in those comments. 
Our goal is to give better tools to creators to self-moderate their comment sections and wall posts, and deem what is and isn't appropriate according to their own standards. 
The first iteration of the blocking feature will be fairly straightforward: 

1) You'll be able to click on individual comments and/or wall posts on the far right side to either DELETE that comment or BLOCK the user outright. 
2) If you BLOCK the user, the offending comment along with all other comments from that user will automatically be deleted and the user will no longer have access to your profile or series page. 
3) You'll be able to see a full list of users you've blocked to date under Settings, and have the option of unblocking them at any time. (Please note that unblocking will NOT cause their comments to reappear). 

This feature has been long overdue and we hope to improve this feature over time with your feedback. 
We have an absolute zero tolerance policy when it comes to harassment and bullying on Tapas, but do realize our own limitations in taking actions across a community this large and this impassioned. Tapas is just as much your home as it is ours, and everyone should feel safe here. 
This is a powerful tool and we're entrusting the community to do what's right with it. I have full faith that if used properly, this tool will go a long way in making Tapas a better home for all of us. 
All the best, -Michael and the Tapas Staff","["" \n\n1\nYay! This is a feature I know a lot of people have been looking for (myself included) so it's awesome to see it implemented! \nThanks, Michael (and everyone else lol)!!"", ""The consequences of blocking someone seems big but thankfully I've never needed to block anyone myself, I imagine it being necessary though. It's definitely great that you're giving creators that option and I hope it will be used responsibly.\nOut of curiosity, when accessing content you're is blocked from what do you see? Is it a message saying you can't access it because you're blocked or will the website just pretend like the content doesn't exist?"", 'Not that I think that the issue would be problematic here since Tapastic has always more or less been chill in the two years I\'ve been here, but I do sincerely hope that there won\'t be people who block others simply for having a different opinion.

BLOCKED!!! In fact, I know that some people on Twitter will even use what\'s called a ""block-bot"" to block not only the people they don\'t like, but also all of that person\'s own followers meaning you can be blocked by somebody who you didn\'t even know existed simply because you have the wrong opinions apparently. \nWord of advice whether you\'ve heard it before or its your first time hearing it, you should only block somebody as a last resort and that goes not just for here, but just social media in general.

I think it'll help avoid spammers advertising their comic on your profile without permission (which is something I wanted a block feature for) and stop hurtful people in their tracks"", 'Sweet baby jeebuz finally.

I can get rid of a-holes but on the flip side this means we have to basically kowtow to the whims of the artist if we want to comment or give our opinions about something, and knowing that some very rotten apples are out there I really don' feel comfy as a reader knowing that just cause I say hey that dude looks weird I will get band from ever saying anything =C\ndon't know feels like a nuke for a small problem : /but that's just me \nhere's hoping this doesn't go south"", ""@IdiotWithPencil The way I see it...

Blocking has no negative implications on the person blocked, aside from not being able to interact with the person who blocked them. I honeslty believe that if it makes your net experience better, you should utilize the blocking feature accordingly.', ""Thank you for making Tapas a safer place. \nI just hope there won't be cases of dedicated stalkers who make a comeback with multiple new accounts to go around the blocking feature..."", '\n\nAspie_Gamer:\n\nNot that I think that the issue would be problematic here since Tapastic has always more or less been chill in the two years I\'ve been here, but I do sincerely hope that there won\'t be people who block others simply for having a different opinion.

They choose for themselves what they think is overstepping the line.\nPersonally, if I saw anyone spewing ""Anti-SJW"" stuff on my page or any of my comics, I would warn them that their propaganda is unwelcome in my comments sections, and if they didn\'t stop I would block them. It would not be censorship because they still have the whole internet to wander around on, and those of us that are hurt by them sure do feel it. My audience is full of transgender and nonbinary people who already have to take enough in the form of respectless parents, corrupt healthcare systems and the general public\'s opinion (us trans folk literally get killed in the streets still).\nThe last thing they need is someone shoving the same things in their face and telling them their feelings are invalid on top of that when they seek a moment of peace in the webcomics and communities where they feel like they can be proud and accepted for what they are. And I will protect my main audience to the very last drop.\nAlso on Webtoons I\'ve seen fans telling each other to commit suicide. It is nice to finally have some actual permanent power to use in case that ever happens in my tapas audience o_o\'\'\'\nvvv  Also, I second this, this XKCD is pretty spot on: vvv\n\n\nkabocha:\nRelevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1357/ People are going to do what they\'re going to do.\nLoving the blocking feature, guys.

338,Tales Of The Wandering Stranger - Read A New Comic Anthology!,Events | Challenges,[],"Happy Halloween!
On this special occasion, I'm happy to introduce a new comic anthology which I am a part of.
It's called:
Tales Of The Wandering Stranger5

Under the collective ""The Stiched Hand"", we are a group of artists that met online. I can say I had tons of fun participating in this project and I hope there will be more going forward. It's been so awesome seeing all these different styles and story telling coming together around one epic tale.

Of course, you'll be able to read my part of the comic when it comes out a few months later. Below some of the art from my short as a teaser. (Sorry no text to avoid spoilers!)

I'd love to have your feedback on the series. The theme is very fitting to Halloween so it is a great time to start. It will be updating two pages per week - Mondays and Wednesdays!
I will share more process art and information going forward.

345,Is the Search Engine Busted…?,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello! I've noticed recently that the search engine doesn't really turn up comics that I typically search for. I have a comic that isn't in my library simply because they update daily, and I would much rather read their comics in bursts once every week or two. Now when I try to search it though, it doesn't show up anywhere. I had to actually Google search the comic to even find it again. Mind you, I used to have the same issue with this comic when just searching for one or two of the key words, but now not even the full name is pulling up the title.
Curious to see if this was the only case, I started searching up other comics in my library, both new and old. Sure enough, none of them show up in the engine anymore, or if they do it shows up pretty low on the page--especially considering they're all word-for-word searches. The only comics that showed up immediately were the lovely ""exclusive"" comics I remembered the names for, that I started reading but stopped when I realized I could only read the first few chapters.
Now, I'm not one to jump to conclusions, so I'm just curious to see if others are experiencing this problem, and whether or not it's just a mistake in the search engine.","['they probably did not put the name of their comic in their tags. it happened to me too, i had tot put the tags.', ""I noticed this a few days ago. They seem to have changed how search works, so that\nA) it gives priority to premium comics/novels, listing them first even if they're less relevant\nB) it searches for every word individually, and gives every word equal weight, meaning if you search for a comic name that includes words like 'the', you'll get a lot of unhelpful results (including every premium comic that includes 'the', as mentioned above) \nIt's awful and annoying and I hope they change it back, but until then I recommend searching for the most unusual word in the title, and nothing else.\nFor example, the other day I was searching for the comic 'The Ghost that Lingers'. If I search for the whole name, it doesn't come up until page 3 of the search results, with every premium comic with 'the' in the title coming first. However, if I just search for 'lingers', it's the first and only result."", ""@STAFF @michaelson Could ya'll fix this please? It's not even useful for finding certain premium comics. I'm okay with premium comics receiving priority in search results cuz you guys have to make money, and the CPM isn't going up anytime soon, but giving every word equal weight and not factoring in relevance just makes the new search engine useless. And I imagine just makes it harder for readers to find what they want, which leads to EVEN LESS ad-revenue for everyone. \nWhy not instead go back to the old search system but have a box in the search results highlighting some relevant premium comics? Maybe things with the same genres or similar tags as the other comic that was searched for? Like, anything is better than this.\nEDIT: on top of just being an obnoxious nonfunctioning change to a system that was working fine, it also actively goes against tapas’s core value of being a level playing field for all creators to coexist on. Not because it’s further promoting premium comics, but because it’s promoting premium comics at the expense of basically every other creator on the site. I can’t even reliably tell people I know about the series on tapas that they might enjoy because they can’t accurately search for ANYTHING. My own comic appears on page 3 when you type it’s name in (it used to be top result). So if someone wants to know how to find my comic in casual conversation what am I supposed to do, stop and write down a URL on their hand? It would be way more convenient to just tell them the name and have them search it on tapas, like they used to be able to. I’m really dissapointed in this change.\n/rant over""]",2/16/2018 22:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

350,My Birthday’s Coming Up In Ten Days,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello to all. Most of you should know who I am and what I do at this point. lol
If you don't, that's fine. I'm Aspie Gamer
Creator of the niche webcomic Life of an Aspie11
It's that time of year again for me. On Feb 10th, it will be my 22nd B-Day. 
To celebrate this year, I was thinking that I'd might like to have some fresh LoaA fanart to decorate the fan art section of Susan's Secret Stash5, a sort of gallery series I occasionally update with not only fan art, but personal LoaA related doodles I've done in my free time.
Here are the rules if you are interested.

Feb 10th is the deadline.
I don't care what sort of style you have. I'm not picky. Plus its the thought that counts in my book. If your art looks like MS Paint, I promise I won't laugh at you.  
You can draw any character(s) from LoaA including my newest one Naomi Watanabe who's set to debut in the next Chapter of the comic. Speaking of that, Here's a link to my Instagram account where you can find art I've done of Naomi if you decide to draw her1 Be creative. Draw Susan in a video game outfit. Draw someone in a popular manga style. Recreate a page from the comic. Its up to you. 
No NSFW art please. Nudity is fine if its played for laughs (i.e Susan wearing her ""birthday suit"" and having a laugh about it) or you decide to do a nude pose reference in your style using one of my characters. Keep it barbie doll anatomy though. (no genitals) Female nipples are okay with me. I personally don't consider that to be taboo or really that provocative by itself. If anything, to me its something you have a quick laugh at and then go about your day.
One submission per person. Once my B-Day comes and goes, I'll publish everybody's fan art in a new episode on Susan's Secret Stash called ""Birthday Fan-Art"". Credit will obviously be given along with a shout-out to your webcomic if you have one.  

Have fun. Surprise me with what you can come up with. 
Just make sure to follow the aforementioned rules. Nudity is again acceptable  including female nipples. 
Just nothing erotic, gory, or anything that you really wouldn't want your boss, teacher, or parent seeing.","[""Happy 10 days before birth day! I'll try to do fanart if possible.""]",1/31/2018 16:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTW: This isn't intended as spam: I made a thread for the Webcomicker's market a few weeks ago, and people really liked it and said it should be stickied.  However, I write a lot of other stuff in that vein, so in lieu of that, I thought that maybe the blog as a whole should have a thread where people can keep track of it.","['I can\'t love this enough!

There can be a GREAT level of discrepancy between the amount and/or the kind of emotion the creator puts into a work, and what is felt by the viewer. I\'m sure there are some people out there who feel absolutely nothing from my work. But if they accuse me of not putting enough heart into what I do, you bet I\'ll be flipping a table. Or two. Or a hundred. Even a thousand tables flipped would not be enough to express how strongly I feel toward my story. I don\'t even want to use the word ""feel"" because it sounds... inadequate. \nI happen to be lucky enough to have met a certain comic creator in person. The amount of passion she has for her work is indescribable. I\'ve met many other creators, but she really, really stands out. Yet I only know this because I got to spend time with her and witness her attitude in person. Her work is good, certainly, but I would not be able to feel the depth of her passion (or emotion or whatever) just by looking at her illustrations or by reading her comics. Sadly, I\'m sure there are people who can\'t feel a thing from her works and might describe it as ""lacking heart,"" too.  \nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, there are also cases where the creator didn\'t really care much, but people just connect to it and find a lot of heart in it...', 'I think you\'re conflating personal taste and the definition of ""great art"" too much, though.  Even though a number of people will always disagree, I think some  things can objectively be called ""great art,"" whether or not you personally like it.  For example, even if you\'re not a fan of religious art and feel nothing when you look at it (like me, TBH), The Last Supper is obviously the work of a master painter and very influential.   \nSo, that said, don\'t you think you\'re actually proof of the article?  Because Heart of Keol is, objectively, one of the higher-quality webcomics out there.  Even if someone doesn\'t like it, hates the characters, etc., they\'d have to admit that the writing and art are on a completely different level than your average, scribbly, two-gamers-on-a-couch comic,.  So the passion that you put into it definitely shows, regardless of taste.', ""Honestly I don't think most religious (Christian to specify, it is rather over analyzed)paintings are all that interesting or even worth anymore analyzing.  You have to realize that there was a lot of money for artist to do religious painting. It wasn't always because they had an intense emotion toward it. Leonard de Vinci had wonderful drawings that you could see the passion in it but you can't see it as much in his religious paintings. well that is my opinion. Also there is great art that are really not recognized at all and people don't really care about since it doesn't fit their idea of art. Do you know many native American artist that are well known for their art compare to white Americans? I am willing to bet that you don't. I don't find that article to be really realistic. not all art is made in time of extreme emotions. I don't think most artist can even draw when they are extremely sad or angry. though some can but it doesn't really make to much sense."", ""also I do agree with keii4ii since it is sometimes really hard to know the exact feeling an artist had during the moment they were doing their art. They might be bored, angry, sad, happy or have no emotion at the moment and that is fine! that doesn't mean they have no passion behind it!"", ""Michelangelo hated working on the Sistine Chapel painting, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a work of a master painter. And someone who doesn't know how much he disliked painting might think they see a lot of passion behind it, too.\n\n\nCSJones:\non a completely different level than your average, scribbly, two-gamers-on-a-couch comic\nBeing better than average and scribbly isn't saying much, is it?

354,Minion Tales reboot,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey there everyone!
My name is Oliver Wrriter Dlugi and I'm creating this topic to catch a slightly more attention for my ""event"" of rebooting a comic series.
It's all about three red minions from the game League of Legends that are attending the so called Minions Academy to learn necessary things about what would be their future job to.. well, get constantly spawned, walk straight, fight till the enemy nexus is destroyed. Their live sucks.
I really love to interact with people even when I'm a bit shy. I decided from the start that my small follower base will decide what should I do with the comic and thus it's being rebooted into something else. However... I'm really happy that I got some response but I'd love to hear much more ideas and such regarding topics touched during this ""reboot event"".
That is why I'm creating this topic! To get more people involved in the creation process! I want that everyone feels like one way or another they had a word in the creation process.
As of now I'm asking for things related to four character sketches I posted today.

tapas.io2



Minion tales :: teacher suggestion box | Tapas
What? Expected me to drop dead? Not this time baby..!

This time around there are no outlined, color filed drawings. I really have a lot on my shoulders..

So I'd love to hear some of your ideas for naming the characters above.. I still haven't...





Maybe you have a cool idea for a name? Some accessory a character should have? Maybe some traits they should have in their personallity? Or even a whole concept for a minion teacher of your own??
I would love to read into anything no matter if it would be a short post/comment or a wall-text. I'd respond basically to everything in a form of... thank you(?).
Oh, a small disclaimer. This is not a ""make a comic premise for me"" or something along these lines. I could make this all on my own but it is more fun to have people involved in the creation ",[],0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
355,2017 Tapas(tic) Secret Santa Sign-ups! (CLOSED),Events | Challenges,[],"Helloooo everybody! Name is JJ and it's that time again~. 
Normally I hate bringing up Christmas over a month before it but, well, events like these need advanced notice. I'm officially launching the Sign-ups. Let's see how many people we can get together this time!

 Sign-Up Form44

Sign Up Guidelines
The following information is what you will need to provide. You HAVE TO sign up through Google Forms this year in order to be added to the participants list. 

The name of your story and a link to it
The name of your character/characters you want to be drawn and a link to at least one reference (more is better!)
You must have at least one full body, colored reference
Name any special requests
Willingness to volunteer (if someone drops out, are you willing to take their place and draw two secret santas?)


Deadline for signing up will be November 20
**After signups are complete, I will post the assignments and the deadline

Secret Santa Rules

Must have a story on Tapastic with at least one chapter that includes the character/characters you want drawn.This is so we can get a good idea of your character's personality

Must have a full body drawing, coloured, of your characterDoesn't have to be ""good."" Just need colours so we know what they look like!

After the signup deadline has passed, everyone will be given a Secret Santa at randomA deadline will be given as encouragement to complete the work, especially as a Christmas gift!

Once completed, there will be a new thread for which you can post your secret santa on. More details will be added later.
If you decide to drop out half way through, message me and I will have someone take your placeI value commitment so this is for emergencies only.



Important Information

A lot has changed since I last hosted the Secret Santa. Writers have been added for example. For this year, anyone who can provide a full body, coloured image of their chosen character, and can provide a drawn present for their secret santa can participate. I conduct a survey at the end of every year and I will gladly accept suggestions for the future! I would love everyone to participate but I never expected novels to be added to Tapastic.
In the rules, I say you must have a story with at least one chapter on Tapas. This can be in the form of a novel OR webcomic. All that matters, as stated above, is that you are able to provide a full image of your character(s) and can make one for your present.


When you complete your piece, email it to me at this address. Your email should include ""Secret Santa"" and your participant number in the title.(I am also gladly accepting future suggestions to make this process smoother)

Reply to this thread for any questions you have, that which I'm sure there will be many. It's weird adjusting to the new Tapastic OKEEEI?

363,Create a Comic Event (1 Million Coin Grand Prize),Events | Challenges,[],"Well it took 7 months but I finally have enough coins to start the 1 million coin create a comic event!  My last event, the 50k Coin Event14, was a failure in terms of participation, but I do appreciate those who participated @Lucazu & @PotooGryphon (For her fan-art).  I'm hoping this event has a bigger turn out.
THIS EVENT IS A GO BIG OR GO HOME EVENT, ONE WINNER WILL GET THE EQUIVALENT OF A 1 MILLION COIN TIP (OR $708.33 AFTER TAPAS FEES).  THE ONLY WAY THIS CRITERIA WILL CHANGE IS IF AN OUTSIDE SOURCE OPTS TO OFFER OTHER PRIZES (OR OTHERWISE STATED).
Just to prove I do in-fact have enough coinage to pay out this massive prize, here ya go (Note all of these coins were earned through the advertisements on the app):
capture(5).png1346x601 29.6 KB

EDIT: A screen shot of 1 mil coins has been added to replace the original 994K coins
Create a Comic Event
In this event you are tasked with creating a comic using characters from my series Marked36, although that doesn't mean you can't use characters from your own comic as a crossover.
The comic you create can be based around anything (Action, Love, Comedy, etc.) EXCEPT for the following:
Restrictions

BL (Boy Love)
GL (Girl Love)
Eroticism (Nope sorry you can't make anything erotic, sexual, or anything of that sort - This does not mean you can't have a character shirtless or in a swimsuit, it just means they be can't doing anything sexual [This does NOT bar kissing/romance])
Nudity (Does not include comedic nudity, underwear permitted)
Religion or Anti-Religion (The series it'self is based around biblical events but to keep drama out of it I'm placing a ban on religious subjects)

If want to do something but FEEL like it could be part of these exceptions it is better to ask than hope it won't be disregarded.Entry Requirements
To enter this event you MUST have tipping enabled on your account as it will be the method of giving out the prize
I will NOT be requiring you to subscribe to my comic if you do not want to, I understand why some creators do that, but I want people to subscribe if they genuinely enjoy the comic and not because they want to enter a contest.
HOWEVER I am going to require that you post a comment on a single page of my comic that is relevant to the page/page order, AND a comment on this forum post saying you want to enter and adding your Tapas name.  This is so that I can keep track of who is participating and be able to check your tip availability (Because that is important).Prize
1,000,000 (1 Milllion) Coin TipCharacters
Any of the characters from the comic are usable.  I would make an image list showing the characters, like last time, but I'd rather not have a large image list right here
Here's a quick list of select character silhouettes11, Although some of the character refs are outdated in terms of visual look (Such as Sako and the orange haired demon)
I had hoped three other characters could be introduced for use, but it'll be months before their debut.Judging
The judging of this event will be based on a many number of things:


Art - While art is important, this contest is more leaning towards story. (But sometimes art speaks volumes for story )

Story - Story is an important factor in judging, if you can grab at heart strings or have a really good laugh, or do whatever you do for a great story you're on your way to awesome.

Length - Due to the contest being aimed more towards story, length can either help or hinder you, sometimes you can get more across with simplicity, but at the same time simplicity can hurt your story, choose wisely.

Quality - Quality of art and story are important, if your story is compellingly beautiful, hilarious, or action packed and your art doesn't portray your amazing story in the way you planned it to, it can be hard to get the message across.

Example Comic:
Art is important to the creation of comics and color can add to your comics visual beauty, but you don't have to be super extremely fancy and add a whole bunch of beautiful colors and gorgeous landscapes to win (I mean it does help in judgement, bonus points if you're that dedicated) but what I'm hoping for, for this event, is story driven more then art driven.  I know you comic artists all have your own comics to work on and have due dates for when it needs to get done so if you can't get your art up to par then try not to sweat it too bad.

BeachColor.jpg3058x2468 976 KB

I finished this mini comic in about a day.Judging
For fairness sake and better judgment I would like if @michaelson and the @STAFF could be judges, and  @PotooGryphon if she wants to.
I don't expect anyone to be a judge, it would just be nice for the sake of differing opinions.  Of course final judgement and prize distribution would go through me.Due Date
The current due date is November 18 at 11:59 PM EST
Due date may change to a later date depending on whether or not participants be need more time.  (And/or outside interference whether good or bad)Edit: I forgot Sako and Moto don't actually have belly buttons when I was making the mini comic... Just a pet peeve I had with myself, it's fixed now.","['well, you know who will certainly enter again ^^ I do hope your new contest will attract many others! And many new readers for Marked <3', ""Wow that's a lot of coins saved up! I don't know if I'll enter, but I'm commenting so I don't lose the thread. "", ""Couple of questions: I know you said length is per our discretion, but can you clarify more? You you just like whatever as long as it tells a complete story?\nAlso, have you considered that participation is down and may be down again because the contest requires the use of our comic? For example: Wintrekitty's contests allows for much greater freedom and creativity and has gotten decent numbers despite the smaller prize. Maybe pick her brain for ideas or maybe even team up?"", ""The length of the mini comic can be as long as you want it to be, it could be a single page (Or a couple panels if long format) or it can be 5-10 pages, whatever it takes to tell the mini story.  How you tell that story is up to you.\nAnd yes I know that I'm limiting the entire contest to my comic (Though I did say you could do a crossover if you wished), but with this particular contest I wanted it to be like the previous one because this is a LOT of coins on the line, and subsequently a hefty some of money, so I wanted to not only test the story making abilities of my fellow comic creators but also be able to advertise my comic.\nIn a future contest (The next contest to be exact) it will most likely be a 100k coin contest to design two characters who are the same character (Just gender flipped).  The creative freedom on that will be slightly limited but not like how this one is."", ""I'm just bumping this up :3"", ""Definitely a sizable prize!  Hurrah!  Unfortunately we're going to have to pass.  We've tried doing contests before and it doesn't work out so well.  The last contest we did we spent a considerable amount of money paying our artists and then we didn't even place.  If we hired our artists to do more than a few pages, we'd have to win just to break even, and there's no guarantee of that.  Also it means giving up all that production time which would slow down our main series considerably."", ""Well thank you very much \n\n\nGoldenPlume:\nDefinitely a sizable prize!  Hurrah!

Both of them (BL especially) are very big on Tapastic and from what I've noticed it's an easy way to get subscribers (Not to say the creators of those comics don't put effort into it, it's just has a large following on the site) and my comic has nothing to do with either of them so it just wouldn't make sense.\nNot really any other way I can come up with a way to answer it except I'm just not a fan of BL or GL romance stories and for these particular comic contests I'd like to keep them out of it.

This time, a whole new, more organized method so I don't disappear on people again!And possibly considering a bi-annual secret santa. I'm also thinking of possibly other holiday-related events that don't already exist. Feel free to throw ideas around.
Anyone who is interested, let me know! If we do it again, it'll begin around November.

373,Celebrity Baby Contest #3!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi everyone, I'm Rowan, I draw The Celebrity Babyverse2. I've had fun running 2 contests last month, we even had 2 winners, so I want to try it again!
If you haven't seen the series, basically the Celebrity Babies' designs are based on the wacky names of real-life celebrity offspring. Bear Blaze Winslet sets teddy bears on fire, Blue Ivy Carter feels blue all the time, Egypt Keys unlocks pyramids, you get the idea. The contest is simple: I show you a preview of the next Celebrity Baby, and see if you can guess who it is.
The first person to post the correct answer will be the winner! I don't have any merchandise to offer as a prize, but I can totally draw something for you, be it your OC, some kind of fanart, anything. Don't worry if you know nothing about the wild and wooly world of celebrity baby names, I'll give you some clues. If you can figure out who the parents are it's easy to search what odd names they gave their tragically rich children.
Here she is, Celebrity Baby 038:
contest038.png940x1420 306 KB

Celebrity Baby 038 is a girl, but she has a boy's name. Her actress mother has a boy's name's too, and her actor father has a name that's used by both boys and girls. Her parents met on the set of a superhero film, but not the superhero film that made her father really successful, that came 5 years later. The first 4 letters of that good superhero film are the opposite of the first four letters of her mother's family name, kinda.
Who is this masked vigilante Celebrity Baby? Be the first to answer correctly and I'll draw you anything you like!","[""I'm useless.

375,Tapas Creator Incubator Announcement: UPDATE: THANK YOU!,Events | Challenges,[],"Tapas Creator Incubator Program
With a family of over 26,000 comic and novel creators, Tapas has always been a celebration of people like yourself: unique, talented, and highly motivated independent creators. 
Now, we're excited to announce that we’ll be seeking opportunities to work even more closely with a select group of creators through our new Tapas Creator Incubator program. Woo hoo!
What is the Tapas Creator Incubator?
Creators will be invited to work in-house at Tapas HQ (located in the Bay Area of California), where together with the editorial team, they’ll create new and exciting original stories. Creators will be paid for their work during the program period and have joint ownership of the stories produced. We’ll not only provide you with full editorial resources, but also help you develop exciting business opportunities such as physical publishing with large distributors or TV/online original series deals. 
But best of all, you’ll be surrounded by other creators to constantly receive creative support and feedback. We want to celebrate the creator community by bringing creators closer together in a fun and engaging creative space. 
We’re Looking For Comic and Graphic Novel Creators Who...

Have a passion and drive to create exciting and original stories
Play nice with others
Currently publish on Tapas, this isn't a requirement, but a strong plus (wink wink) 

What We’re Looking For...
Original Stories
If you have a great, original comic idea that you’ve been dying to draw but have been unable to find the time or money to make a reality, we want to help you! Creators can work on original stories or develop new stories together with the Tapas staff.
Novels-to-Comics
Perhaps you don’t have a comic idea but would like to contribute to a story with your art. Luckily, there are many novels on Tapas, and we’re looking for awesome visual storytellers who can turn these original novels into epic graphic novels. 
Mobile-Optimized Vertical Format
Your project must fit our preferred format: full-color, mobile friendly (also known as “vertical scroll” or “infinite canvas”), and be long-form narratives. A single season will consist of 20+ episodes, with each episode being roughly 30 panels.
Time Frame
Approx. 3-6 months for a single season of an original story
Compensation
Creators will be paid a monthly stipend during the project period. The amount will vary between individual contracts (which will depend on various factors).
The monthly payment works as an advance, or minimum guarantee, toward future revenue share from the works. This means that when it comes to potential earnings from the project, sky’s the limit. This is NOT a work-for-hire deal.
Residency
Creators will have the option to work with us out of Tapas' California headquarters, in a full studio space for free during the project period.
One advantage of being physically in-house is the proximity to other creators as well as the Tapas staff, which allows more direct and instant feedback. (Please be noted that Tapas will not cover travel/relocation costs, living costs, accommodations, physical art materials, or visa.) 
Apply Now
If you're interested, please send email to submissions@tapasmedia.co with the following information:
Your profile on Tapas (if applicable) If you're not currently publishing with us, tell us about yourself with links to your websites or social media pagesWhether or not you’re interested in the residency programProject(s) you’re interested in
For original stories:
Story pitch with synopsis (in 2-3 paragraphs)Concept art and/or samples of previous/current works
For novels-to-comics:
Samples of previous/current worksYour favorite genres to draw in Optional: a potential novel on Tapas you’d like to adapt
Please be advised that your application does not guarantee a response from us. Even if we're interested in working with you, due to the volume of emails we receive, our responses might be delayed.
However, we will do our best to review your application and get back to you as soon as possible. 
Submissions will close on September 9, 2017. 
Our vision is to help create an environment to nurture the webcomic community and hopefully expand to bring on a wider range of creators such as web novel writers in the near future. Having a creative space to let creators explore, experiment and expand their imagination has always been a dream of ours, and we’re finally ready to take the first in the series of many exciting steps to making that dream come true. We hope that you’re just as excited as we are for the Tapas Creator Incubator and we look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Always,-Chang Kim & the Tapas Staff

So bad that it could keep you from entering the country ever again if caught.', ""oh...well...that's what I thought...too bad, but it seems logical indeed."", ""Maybe I'll send you something..."", ""For those who would need to e-commute, is there a particular time we would have to be available or will the hours be flexible in that regard as long as production is met and communication is timely? \n(I have kids so there's times during the day I am transporting them to and from school, and etc)"", 'Is this offer even available for people outside of America? What with the complications of work visas and immigration?', ""This sounds cool; I appreciate how y'all are always trying new things. \nIf I understand the Compensation section correctly, selected creators get a stipend from Tapas to cover cost of living during the program period, with the promise of a cut of future comic sales. Is this correct? \nDo you have an estimate of how much money the stipend will be? I get that it varies, but a ballpark budget number would be appreciated for those of us who'd have to quit our jobs and/or move, etc. Thank you!""]",8/8/2017 13:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No? You won’t accept my homework with monster goo on it? \nSigh. This is never going to work.\nThought through my plan long and hard until I reached the polished gates of the school. The bell had not yet rung and all the other extra punctual students lounged under the trees. I felt a bit irritated. How can they just lay around enjoying the weather? Don’t they know there is a whole world of the dark and grotesque just beneath the surface? Of course not. \nLet’s not talk about the slimy tentacled creature that exploded out of my vending machine ramen last night. Who decided that cup noodles should be the next gate from the underworld? That doesn’t even make sense - the dark lord should fire his gate keeper. \nWell, maybe we should talk about the creature for a moment. There I sat, Sunday night, minding my own 12-year-old business in our tiny apartment. An earlier run in with a disgruntled shrine ghost down the road left me with bandages wrapped around my legs. The ghost became enraged I suppose from the neighborhood squirrels who kept stockpiling nuts on top of its miniature wooden roof. Unlucky for me, said ghost had reached its limit for squirrel tom foolery as I passed by. It first grabbed my legs before pulling me into the bushes. Folks passing by gave me odd looks with what appeared to be the most ridiculous fight with a bunch of squirrels. Using my book bag to block its attack, the ghost used its ethereal claws, ripping open the leather. My school papers, torn to shreds by now, flew into a frenzy. Lucky for me, the ghost clawed its way into a certain spell scroll tucked away. The ghost screeched and wriggled away back into its shrine.\nI looked down, despondent at my destroyed homework. I had spent all afternoon with a tutor finishing the assignment. \nI picked myself up and collected my things. My legs were bloody and bruised, but I had fared worse. A nearby squirrel chittered at me - distraught I had knocked over its stash of nuts. Priorities, right? \nI knew I needed to burn the midnight candle tonight to redo my homework, so off I went. On the road home, I saw my favorite vending machine - a gift from the heavens. Or so I thought. In went my 200 yen and out came my cup of ramen noodles. I threw myself down on the floor in a heap once I reached home. Setting the ramen aside as I pulled out what remained of my shredded homework, I started copying what I could remember onto a new sheet of paper. \nHours went by and hunger began to set in. My watch ticked three in the morning, my eyes droopy and my stomach growling. The dreaded paper of doom is now complete. I set my paper aside on the coffee table and grasped my cup noodles. \nWhen I pulled the lid off the cup noodles, what popped out defied all physics. Yes, even that controversial one.\nHundreds of greenish grey slippery rubbery legs sprung outwards, filling the room. Suction cups lined with razor blades ripped at everything in sight. I dodged left, and then I dodged right and even rolled behind the couch as tentacle flashed past me, smashing into the TV behind me. That is going to be a fun one to explain to my parents when they get back from their business trip. Then I see it. A leg covered in goo swiped past the coffee table. \n“My homework!” I shouted. \nIt misses the paper and I grab a kitchen knife off a dirty plate nearby. Swiping downwardand off comes one of its tentacles. Green iridescent slime sprayed outward, covering almost everything in the room. I tumble my way to my damaged bag and out comes another spell scroll. With my last ounce of energy, I tossed the scroll towards another tentacle. It burns through the creatures’ rubbery, putrid flesh. The creature cracks and turns to ash with a loud wail. The smell of rotten fish almost consumes me. \n“Mom and dad won’t suspect a thing; little burnt calamari never hurt anyone right?” I asked myself as desperation set in.\nWith my homework safe, if not a bit sticky, I collapsed on the floor. \nThat morning I arrived at school, head pounding from coming up with sensible excuses. I took a deep breath, coming back to reality for a moment. The school bell rang its obnoxious tone. The teacher is waiting at the door, taking papers from students as they enter the room. My head hung low, I hand her the paper. She pauses for a moment, her expression unchanging. She takes the paper in hand adding it to the stack, unfazed by its condition. \n“I got attacked by a squid!” I squeak. An eyebrow peaks from the teacher. “I’m sure,” she replied, “Take your seat please.” Sitting at my school desk, my cell phone vibrates in my beat-up bag. Peeking, the message reads:“Mom: Conference ended, be home soon!”\nWell, crap.   \nMy tipping comic:\n\ntapas.io1\n\n\n\nGoblins of Razard | Tapas\nA young man flees his older brother who wishes him dead.

Been awhile since I just wrote something\n\nTrue LoveIt started off subtle.\nI would see him in the halls, and let my gaze linger on him for a few seconds too long. He would make his way into my thoughts as I daydreamed in the library. I would be taking notes in class, just to find out that I had scribbled his name all over the page. Inserted into the margins, drawn outside the lines, and written as the solution to equations. \nDillan.\nI couldn’t understand my sudden attraction to him. We had spoken once, maybe twice, about mundane school things. But now, just being in the same room as him made my heart want to pound out of my chest. I started following him to his job. He worked as a barista at a Starbucks. He’d get off late and close up, and I’d follow him home. He slept on the second floor, in a small bedroom plastered with dozens of posters. Over the next few weeks, my grades began to fall and my boss threatened to fire me if I kept missing work. I wanted to stop myself, but I couldn’t. \nI think at some point, he picked up on my obvious attraction to him. It’s hard to accept, but I know there’s no way around it. I’m cursed with an undying love for him. He had to have known. How else could this situation be explained? There had to be… supernatural forces or something at work here. \nAnd I believe I confirmed that suspicion when I broke into his house after a month of pining. I knew his schedule well by that point. He had just gotten home from work a few hours ago, assumed to be asleep by the time I entered. I found a shrine of some type set up in his basement. I could see dozens of candid photos of myself spread across the shrine. A pentagram painted onto the wood, candles that were mere nubs by the time I came across them. \nIt made sense that I just needed to destroy the shrine, and I would be free. But as I approached the damn thing, I felt a coldness in the pit of my stomach. I get filled with thoughts of how I couldn’t destroy this shrine. That Dillan needed my love, and if I were to destroy this… I’d be alone forever. Instead, the shrine gave me ideas of how to better show my love and appreciation to Dillan. He had gone through so much trouble to get the curse to work, after all. \nSo, I sat by his bedside and waited… and waited… and waited… And soon morning came. When he woke up, he seemed surprised at first. He struggled against his restraints and tried to speak, but I had already taken precautions by duct-taping his mouth shut. \nI gave him a warm smile, my head tilted to the side. “Good morning, beautiful.”\nHe doesn’t seem all too calmed by my friendliness. He soon tired himself out with his useless struggling, and I waited for him to stop with patience. He stared at me, eyes full of distrust and worry, but I’d soon change that. Soon he’ll look at me the same way I look at him. With love, with joy, with excitement. \nWith a little bit of disgust.\n\nMy tipping comic: \n\ntapas.io2\n\n\n\nTwisted Tails | Tapas\nWhat would you do if it turned out your new cats weren't actually cats, but were criminals from another universe?\n\nUpdates Wednesdays~\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'Ooo, this was good.

Boo!"", 'You have about 16 hours left until 23:59 gmt London! Just try your best!', 'I am cursed with an undying love.A love for something I can never reach, a love which has eluded me ever since my first steps into the hallowed halls of our community library.A yearning that I could never fulfill.Even now, as an adult, stepping into these halls once again, albeit for a different cause, that love keeps coming back to taunt me, to fill my head with promises that were never fulfilled.I ran my hand over the dusty counter, a counter full of happy memories, of books returned and lost, of haggling over penances, of our librarian, Ms. Bakan.I sighed my head, and continued forward, turning my head to look at past mementos.A few more paces. I noticed the dust getting thicker and thicker, covering everything in a thin blanket. A poor man\'s snow.A little to the left. There. A corner where me and my mates used to eat candy bars we sneaked in from the store nearby. Later on, in our teenage years, a corner where we experimented on new things. Drugs. 5 dollar wine. You name it, we tried it.Come on now, just a bit more. Your legs, your frail sticks, can and will make it.There. Another corner. Another time, place, memory. A girl, Hannah. Helga? I sighed. Another name, lost to time\'s unforgiving wood chipper of ideas.My first experience. We snuck in, late at night. Exploring new places, new little nooks and crannies where librarians hid the best books that nobody would ever find.Oh, what a find we had! Rowling, Brown, Grisham, Silva, Crichton, and even a full list of Adam\'s works. There were so much. There were too much.We couldn\'t resist. We read all of them.And even after that ran out of allure, we decided to explore our bodies.We explored how fast or slow one should go, how to get somebody higher into the realm of pleasure before you. How to pleasure.But that is nothing, compared to now. Those are the bygone fruits of foolish endeavors.The last steps. A staircase. Finally. Huh.It\'s still there.I walked up towards it, feeling the black, burnished wood under my fingers. The feel of the strings, rusted with years of unuse and abuse alike. The seat, worn leather exuding dust upon a single press of my palm.As I felt every inch of my friend, I remembered something, an excerpt from a book that had caught my eye. ""And once the notes are in the air, they collide against one another. They spark. They burst.""I wonder if that will happen.I wonder if my notes will reach out, farther than I could see, colliding with one another and solving that Gordian Knot inside of me.My last chance. Before everything runs out. Time, money, self-belief. All run out in the end.This is my time.With a heavy sigh, I sat on the seat, fingers poised to pounce, to make these hallowed halls sing once again of happy times.To make everything better.A deep breath. A count to 5. Exhale. Go.Fingers weaving, darting in and out as fast as needles, playing the fantasy I\'ve always wanted to see.I\'ve waited a very long time for this. The build-up. Fingers, going faster and faster, in danger of tiring out.I keep going.I just want to see her again.Now, the chorus. Melodies, flats, sharps, scales, all bleeding into each other.Memories start flooding into my mind.Of how I first met her, banging on the keys with some kind of childish determination, trying to make harmony from chaos.Of that same smile she flashed me, full of uncertainty and anxiety, but yet filled with that fire.The succeeding years of improvements and failures, of periods of work and periods of rest. And finally, the year everything broke down.Wait. Do I see something?A hazy blur, almost disrupting my concentration, my fingers shifting melodies once more. From the base of Chopin to the high notes of Beethoven.There.I could hardly notice it, but there. Beside me. The smell of lemon and spearmint.Her smell.Then, all of a sudden, new notes start to play. Another melody, full of force and bravado, and yet so quiet, starts playing alongside mine.I almost sobbed in relief. She IS here.Then, a voice.""I missed you, you know?""I almost stopped playing. My heart threatened to jump out of my chest, whether out of fear, surprise, or longing, I wouldn\'t know.She must\'ve noticed my fingers slowing down, for she said, ""Please don\'t stop...it\'s my only link here.""I tried swallowing back my tears, and focused back to playing, to keeping the rhythm and the beat alive. The words stuck to the back of my throat.""I-I...mis-missed you t-t-too...""A ghost of a sigh. The melody began changing once again. From the high notes of Beethoven to the soothing, slow notes of Senbonzakura...and the sound of keys, imitating the sound of slow rain.""You know, I always wondered how you play and yet are able to do other things."" An echo of laughter. ""I never learned.""I sighed, while my fingers moved with a mind of their own. She continued. ""I focused too much on the inside.""Senbonzakura began moving faster and faster, to keep up with my emotions, shifting and turning into different things, things I had never seen before until now. Things I kept to myself.Longing, unrequited sorrow, happiness.Surrender.After a period of silence, she then said, ""Why come here, after all this time?""""Why me, of all people?""""Why do you still want me to stay?""""Even after what I\'ve done?""The man began slowing down, his fingers trembling with emotion. His determined Turkish March slowing down to a slower Bach Minuet. And then nothing.It took a long while, a period where his fingers did nothing at all but lay on the ivory keys, some now wet with his tears.“I just wanted to see you again.”“Because I love you.

380,Celebrity Baby Contest #2!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi everyone, I'm Rowan, I draw The Celebrity Babyverse1. I had fun running a contest last week, we even had a winner, so I want to try it again!
If you haven't seen the series, basically the Celebrity Babies' designs are based on the wacky names of real-life celebrity offspring. Bear Blaze Winslet sets teddy bears on fire, Blue Ivy Carter feels blue all the time, Egypt Keys unlocks pyramids, you get the idea. The contest is simple: I show you a preview of the next Celebrity Baby, and see if you can guess who it is.

Celebrity Baby 031 is a girl, if the eyelashes didn't give it away. She's the only Celebrity Baby named after a Pokemon, but she spells the word how it's supposed to be spelled. Her parents are musicians, though one is much more famous than the other. Her singer-songwriter mother was one of the biggest alt-rock stars of the nineties, and she even played God in a movie once, while her father is a rapper I'd never heard of before.

390,Who’s hyped up for SSB4?!,Events | Challenges,[],"I know SDCC is having a digital give away via Nintendo if you do this hash tag smash thing there. More details here: SDCC SSB4 download give away6
I've already played the 3DS version two times and wii u version once at the SSB4 @ BestBuy event. Photo collage  2
I think the controls are hard to grasp, like super hard! I remember that the c-stick moves on the 3DS version has to used by double tapping the circle pad + some other button. It was just bad, the Wii U pro controller controls are similar. So, no matter what, get the Game Cube adapter!It was still fun! I got to face against mega man and little mac. I beat them up with Kirby, lost in the Wii U version though. Huge sword smash action right there for Kirby. But I didn't know how to get other characters powers as Kirby in it because of the controls! I mainly spammed his down b attack where kirby turns into a stone or other item.  
If others have tried SSB4 or may question me, feel free to talk here  ","['SSB4 has been out for a while now, i play it almost daily, i\'m pretty competitive,i started on brawl where i got the basics and such, but sm4sh is a lot better indeed, it has the competitiveness of melee but more characters and brighter graphics and less bullshit (am looking at you, ledge grabbing and fox shining!)what are your mains/favorite characters to play? i have a bunch, where i cant really say i only ""main"" 1 character, i\'d pick lucario as my most favorite, he was since brawl and still is, but i enjoy faster paced characters like fox (which i very recently replaced with falco whom i never liked before but was surprised to do so) and bayonetta.been practicing peach for over a month now and i got very good with her, so i eventually moved on and currently practicing megaman, because of how satisfying it is to do that foot-stool metal-blade drop jab reset combo, and it has been pretty fun so far!', ""When it comes to smash, I'm... alright. I wouldn't consider myself great at the game, more just decent in general! When it comes to characters, I usually play pretty low-tiered dudes, like Ganondorf, ROB, Mr. Game & Watch, and Dr. Mario. Recently I started picking up Mario, mostly cause I love his cape and dunking people with Forward-Air.A recurring problem in all games I play, actually, is just sticking with bottom tiers by accident. Even if they start High-tier! Roadhog was my main in Overwatch, then the nerfs murdered him. My only other main is Torbjorn."", 'Been playing smash since Melee, but kinda stopped playing it competitive since it takes so much time to be REALLY good at it. Still enter the local tournements, but never get far in the brackets. \nMy main is Kirby, then I have bunch of other that can be called secondaries. Like Yoshi, Falco or Mewtwo.', 'well, whats so bad in something fun being time consuming?and tbh i wouldnt call smash time consuming, you can drop in an out on couple of matches everyday, most decent matches take 2-3 minutes each, you can play a handful in 30 minutes or so.kirby is nice, but i dont really like his neutral play, nor his recovery options,getting far in the brackets doesnt concern me at all, as long as i face worthy opponents and have fun doing so x3', 'If you want to master all the different tech skills, play at a high level and stay on that level, then you have to spend a lot of time playing the game. The dilemma I always have is that ""I could spend all this time master this game, OR I can work on comics.""Smash is not time consuming if you play casual and just for fun.But yeah, getting in high in the bracket isn\'t my goal when I play smash, I\'m more in the ""for fun"" camp.

393,I’ll put you in my graphic novel. Apply inside!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello, all! I haven't had the opportunity to post here alot due to school and work, and the other day I had an idea. 
An issue I've been having with Idyll Haven, my ongoing graphic novel11, is the lack of readership and engagement. So I figured, why not do something to encourage people to read it? I figured I have alot of faceless characters written down or in the back of my head, or just background characters that show up every now and then. This will usually be something I'll reserve for my Patreon1, but, hey, I gotta get people interested in my book, first, eh? 
So, here's what I'm offering. If you'd like to send me a picture or drawing of yourself, along with a description of what kind of abilities you'd like your character to have, I'll assign a number to your character, and pull out a number from a random number generator. If your character was chosen, I'll get your character drawn and implemented within the realm of Idyll Haven. 
I'll do the draw at the beginning of every month, so if you'd like to be a part of the Idyll Haven Universe, then please, post your character in this thread, or email me at davidG@insomnium-eye.com! 
**EDIT: For now, we'll be adding cameos of your characters in the order in which they are received! **

395,Get your comic the TOP! Vote on TWC - May registration,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone!And welcome to this updated thread ""Tapsters vote on TWC"" 2.0!
What is it about? Quick reminder. You might know Topwebcomic37 which displays a banner from your comic in a huge list. By getting votes every day you reach a higher rank and potentially get more exposure.
What I'm suggesting here is to build up a Tapastic solidarity and exchange votes on a daily basis for the whole month.
We are using @jonufele's awesome integrated interface to do this.Just follow this link60 and submit your comic using your TopWebcomic information.
Here are quick instructions you should follow:
1 - Register your comic
2 - Add your comic to the list (not needed when you register the 1st time)
3 - Bookmark the provided url (www.votecomics.com/?mycode=x), if don't know this url, try looking on your browser's history
4 - Always Visit the website using the bookmarked url!
5 - You must confirm that you're logged in at TWC by clicking a link (asked once a day). Before confirming, you need to go check if you're logged in or not, and login if necessary.
6 - Click the vote buttons (every time you click, the button becomes unavailable until the next day (not necessarily 24h), the remaining time is displayed on the button itself, it's the same time displayed at TWC).
7 - Repeat steps 4 to 6 until the month ends.
You can join in any time, but the votes reset on the 1st of every month.When registered, you will be able to vote daily for the list and see your stats according to your attendance.
The more you vote the higher you show on the list!I'm sure you'll see your stats fly high in no time!
Let's climb that ladder up together!
Voting List - TWC interface60

tapas tipping 10m_1.png720x720 753 KB

There's a lot of blah, blah, blah we could use to describe what's going to happen starting July 30th at 5PM (PST). But really, it's just so big, we're just gunna stick to the facts.
FACT: We're having another Tipping Event that will run from July 30th at 5PM (PST) until July 31st at 5PM (PST)
FACT: We're aiming for 10 MILLION coins tipped
FACT: We will be awarding back to tippers a percentage of the coins they tip during the event no later than August 30th and the coins awarded back will also be able to be TIPPED!! (you guys can thank Yoon for that one)
FACT: The breakdown of the percentage awarded back will be as follows:If 2 million or more coins are tipped during the tipping event we will award back 10% of the coins individuals tipped back to those individuals.
If 5 million or more coins are tipped during the tipping event we will award back 20% of the coins individuals tipped back to those individuals.
If we reach our goal of 10 million coins tipped during the tipping event we will award back 30% of the coins individuals tipped back to those individuals.
FACT: We realize this event could result in literally thousands of dollars going directly into the hands of indie creators on Tapas...and we're super excited about it! 
One of our mission statements here at Tapas is MAKING MONEY FOR CREATORS and making that amount as big as a possible. And if you'd like to help in that goal then please feel free to scream, shout, and share (from either rooftops or keyboards) that Tapas is dropping the biggest tipping event for indie creators ever in the history of the world on July 30th. This should be fun.","['Question: Well, not really a question, but more of a request...the awarded back tips- please dont make those only good towards tipping on the premier comics. I practically let my award back tips expire the last time when I found out they could only be used on the premier stuff. I dont read any of the premier stuff, and I felt that stipulation was pretty jacked up.', 'No problem. The coins awarded back last time are what we call Bonus Coins. Bonus Coins can be used to unlock premium content but can not be tipped. Bonus Coins can help indie creators who have work in the premium program. \nThis time around we will be awarding back coins that can be tipped to anyone in the tipping program.  \nThanks!', ""Sounds like fun! I'll be trying to tip more. =3"", ""I've been encouraging my readers to tip for extra updates, but looks like I'd better put that on hold momentarily so that we can save up for the event! >w<)/"", ""This is great! I'll have to earn up some coins so I can tip my favorite creators!"", 'Sweet! Time to hoard some coins, I guess! ', ""Aah man, now that we can tip those extra coins back to creators I'm super excited!

"", ""Ah, rock on!!  Definitely going to start talking about this event, major gratitude to Yoon for encouraging the tippable coin rewards!  Hoping to hit some new milestones with this and the odds are looking proper~  Good luck to everyone, I'll be throwing coins like mad soon~!\n"", ""Oooh, I wish I could participate T_T can't use the app due to windows phone"", ""omg omg this is so awesome guys! i've been saving up so i'll definitely unleash my tips on that day"", ""The ad payouts will most likely stay the same. We're trying our best to add another ad provider ASAP so there might be more and better ad fill outside the US very soon but it's not guaranteed. We're trying though!"", ""Wohoo, save up all the coins! \nQuestion: I'm sorry if I sound rude but would it be ok to download that graphic in the first post and tack it on the end of my comic uploads for this week, to spread the word? Or would that be seen as impolite? I'd like to point out this event to me readers too, but I don't think I can pull a special banner out of my hat that quick...and I'm afraid people don't always read my description under the comic.I would link back to this thread of course "", ""then could someone PLEAAAAASE get back to me on how to tip in the app. Send me a screenshot, ANYTHING I don't know what I'm doing and all my bonus coins always go to waste cause I can't figure out how to give it to people I KNOW have coins enabled but don't know how to make it work either"", ""Go to a comic or artist who you would like to support. If he/she has tipping activated you can spot the 'tip creator' button in lower right corner, under their cover artwork. \nIMG_1849.PNG1536x2048 945 KB\n\nTab on it and you should get to this screen where you can choose the amount you want to tip \nIMG_1850.PNG1536x2048 489 KB\n\nSwipe coins into creator-chan's face. Done  \nIMG_1851.PNG1536x2048 926 KB\n\nIf you can't find the 'tip creator' button than the creator hasn't the tipping feature activated und you can't support him/her. However, you can always tell said person that you want to support them and encourage them to get the tipping feature (I probably would've not activated it either if it wasn't for those comments who were telling me they wanted to send me some tips )\nI hope that helps ""]",7/21/2017 14:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

399,Making Art and Using Mass Media to Fundraise for Real Causes,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello!
I’m Engiru, a highschooler webcomic artist. A few months ago I had an idea to start a project that combines the internet and fundraising (for real causes). I thought that if Loish can have such a successful Kickstarter and 4chan can make (startling) changes both inside and outside of the internet, then why not use those same powers for something bigger than all of us: causes such as world hunger, global warming, and such? Now, you may be thinking: but nonprofits already do that! They have their own social media sites. 
However, as I said, I am a webcomic artist, so most of my experience on the internet is with fandoms, artists, and other people who appreciate the arts. I know that this side of the web is generous and highly connected, as shown through Patreon and trends. Typically, this large, niche group consists of very progressive people, even social justice warriors, and often times, obsessive fans. 
I believe that it has untapped potential to make a difference in the world; thus, I made The Internet Idiots, an organization that plans fundraisers that caters and brings this enormous group together to make a change. Even though I made it specifically for this side of the internet, it is not exclusive and others can join in too. 
You can view the fundraiser, its cause, and how the art aspect is going to work here:

{{CONFIG.pageTags.opengraphDescription}}






As you decide whether or not you want to promote/ participate in this, please keep in mind that I have asked you guys specifically not because of your (amazing) skills in art, but you have many people who believe in you. Indeed, you have numbers, but what really counts is the number of people who take their time to give a like, comment, share, or even go as far to mail you something in your P.O box. It doesn't matter how internet famous you are because everyone is connected somehow, and by participating in this, I hope it reaches people who can donate or spread the message further. Art is a way to connect people and ideas in ways we can never describe, and I hope this fundraiser and organization accomplishes this as well with your help, may it be through making full-blown artwork or clicking the share button. 
You may not have the time to make art for this fundraiser because of other projects, but I hope that you find time to click the share page link button--as I said, you’ve inspired others to pick up the pencil so there is bound to be people who follow you who would want to participate in this and make a well in Africa. It all starts with you. 
Would you help make this meme a dream come true for Walking for Water?
If you have any questions, comments, or pointers, feel free to contact me/ TII through any of our social media sites or just email.",[],0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
400,Tapastic Tourist Trade ‘17 Sign Ups (CLOSED),Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone! Jonny Aleksey (creator of The J-Man Web Series &The Valve Web Series) here. I do art trade type events every so often in the forums, which you can see here:
Alternate Universe 20151
Monster Mash 2015 (for Halloween)2
Secret Admirer 2016 (for Valentine's Day)1
Character Cosplay 20162
Battle Royale 20161
Blind Date 2017 (for Valentine's Day)4
The way I structure my trades is that everyone who wants to participate puts their characters in the comments and when the deadline ends, they'll randomly get someone else's character and make an image with that character based on the theme of the trade.
This trade is one I've wanted to do for a while (it is time!!!!), where characters would swap settings. The character you pick to use in this trade will leave the comic (to be in someone else's) and the character you get will be put into your comic's world. Here's a little visual tutorial of what I'm expecting:

Their character will essentially be a tourist in your comic. They can take some pictures, meet people, whatever! Actually, even though it's called a ""Tourist Trade"", they don't have to act like one. You can have your guest do anything you want. Maybe they're involved in the current storyline, helping the good guys; or even helping the bad guys depending on their personality. It's all up to you, but feel free to ask me any questions you got.
Here's the timeline:
Sign up cut off date: June 30thImage deadline: July 21thTrade Gallery goes live: July 22th
You should get your characters 1 or 2 days after the sign up cut offs in a forum DM.
To sign up, post these in the comments:
-Comic Name/Link-Image of character you want to use-Character personality/skills-Whether or not you can do seconds if someone can't make it on time.
You don't have to show your setting in the sign ups but i would be a good idea to start thinking about where in your comic you'd like this to take place. Somewhere eye-catching and unique to your world. When you are done please DM me in the forums (@aspiderjonny) with your images and who they were for. 
I'm hoping this trade will help everyone get better practice at drawing backgrounds, as I've seen a lot of people talk about how difficult it is. This might be a good way to flesh out your comic worlds as well as make friends and have fun!

407,WintreKitty Contests,Events | Challenges,[],"Well, looks like I might be making these contests a regular thing. If you haven't already seen, I recently held a character design contest1 where the winner received 100,000 Tapas coins and a free critique/edit. 
With the surprising success of the first contest, I've decided to open up the next contest to even more creators, no longer limiting the contests to those involved in the ad revenue programs here on Tapas Media. Donations will now be collected via my Ko-fi1 and by tipping me on the Tapas app where they will go into a pot for the winners. Winners will then receive these funds via PayPal (or similar platforms). First place prizes will be a minimum of $100 (CAD), and may include critiques/edits as well (TBD).
I currently have a  poll running on Twitter4 where you can vote for a theme for the next contest. 
I'll be breaking down the donations, rules, and grading systems shortly after the theme has been decided and will be announced here in the forums, my blog, as well as my contest page1 on Tapas Media.
 These contests will be available to everyone and will be graded in a way that emphasizes creativity, not skill. 
If you have any questions, concerns, comments, or want to provide some advice on how I can adjust these contests to be better in the future, please contact me at wintrekitty@gmail.com, or leave a comment below. I always try to respond within 24 hours.

409,Tapastic Mashup! All Star Fighters [Expressions of Interest],Events | Challenges,[],"Hey all, I'm happy to announce a new event I'm looking at running in the future with enough interest 
The point of this thread is to explain the concept of TM:ASF to you all and see if you would be interested in joining in.
What is All Star Fighers?
All Star Fighters is an event for people to design and submit characters from their comic and pit them against one another in a tournament. Matches would be pre-recorded and then posted for people to see the outcome. Please keep in mind that this is all just for fun and is a great way for the worlds of Tapastic to cross over and for Content Creators to bring their characters to life.
To give you a bit of a preview please check out an example of two test characters going at it, just for demonstration purposes the characters can only attack and heal: http://www.starryday.net/ArtBattleFlash/ArtBattle.html67(Refresh the page to start a new match - you'll notice that sometimes you can have very different outcomes and match lengths)
So how would I go about designing/submitting a character?
The great thing about the design process is it can be as complex as you want to make it. For those who have very little time or motivation all you need to do is include the very basic frames required for a character, tell me roughly how to distribute stats and you're good to go! A basic character will be created and then I work my magic and a character is created. Check out the sheet for the prototype character below to see the little required to create the character, and not even all of these have been used!

Proto Character.png945x352 150 KB
 
For those who want even less effort the idea of support characters to jump into the fray is being considered (they will jump in randomly and cause various effects). But watch this space on that one. EDIT. For at least the first time this event will be running Support characters will not be included however may be considered for future events.
For those looking to really flesh out your character you can do! There's a range of different action types from healing, to buffs, to even changing your characters form (eg. Super Saiyan from Dragonball Z or Trance form from Final Fantasy 9)! You can even change how likely a character is to act, even down to acting differently when they're lower on HP. Even if you have something specific that you're not sure is available by any way I'd love to see if I can accommodate you without being unfair.
The idea is to try and keep your character true to how they fight/act- even for those that aren't much of a fighter!
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, or to let me know you're interested please let me know as lack of interest could unfortunately see the event not going ahead. If there's any comics you think might be interested but don't check the forum much or at all make sure to point them here!
Answers to some possible questions
Q. What's the submission date?A. Submissions are not yet being accepted Just to reiterate this is currently only an expressions of interest thread to make sure there would be enough people wanting to join in. However in the mean time think of how your character fights in battle. If they do a specific move or action in battle then make sure to ask if it's possible. When it comes time for the official request of submission there will be a full explanation of how to create and submit your character
Q. So how long will it take for the process to start and for the event to begin?A. There's still coding to be done and changes to be made, I need to also make sure that there is enough interest to even run the event. At this point I can only say watch this space. 
Q. Can I submit several characters?A. Sure! However if you wanted to submit several characters you'd definitely be expected to put effort into each. (IE. You couldn't do the basic level required for entry for all of your characters, at least not without a valid reason) However it's more than welcomed.
Q. Does my character have to be in a Tapastic hosted comic?A. Yes, the idea of this comic is to bring forth the characters of Tapastic together. They can be background characters, or even characters still to come, just as long as I have a comic to reference them from.
Q. So what's the prize for winning?A. Honestly? Bragging rights  Perhaps some sort of digital trophy, however I want to reemphasize this is is for fun.
Q. So will this be available as something to play after? A. I'm not saying there are no plans, but I'm saying it's not something that is definitely on the table.
Q. So what actually is the bare minimum I need to submit?A. The correct poses (list to be provided at the time of launch for submissions). You don't need to provide me with anything more than that for a character that does nothing more than does a standard attack. Anything else is at my digression.
Q. What about backgrounds?A. It'd be great to see creators also consider creating a background. Even if you only want to create a background then that's fine!
Q. Is there a specific style to draw in?A. Nope, preferably your own! The idea is for characters to look as they would in their own respective comics.","['This looks flippin SWEeeet!', 'This is going to be so awesome  ', 'Sooooo going to do this! YES!  ', 'This looks fun =D What is the deadline for submission of characters?', ""Oh! You know I'm on board! XDBRING IT ON!"", ""I should have added this to the possible questions - derp haha.\nCurrently this is just an expression of interest thread to make sure people would be interested. When the time comes that I'm ready to start requesting people to submit I'll be providing full information about what needs to be submitted when. I might be lenient with the submission date as I want people to actually be able to put their effort into it.\nThough in the mean time I'd say think about the way your character fights in battle - if there are attacks or effects in battle that are true to the character but you're just unsure of if they're possible I can let you know  "", ""I think I'd have been disappointed if you weren't ;D"", 'Great : D! Yeah, I actually have a question concerning attacks- can a character have a weapon? If yes, can it be extending one (like a whip/rod etc.)?', 'As long as you can draw them in the poses holding/using it! ;D', 'I think I can do something for this', 'Can you post a link to the prototype you showed in the Skype Chat?

Tons of other people walked past me without being put through special control so the only reason I can see that they would want to investigate me further after seeing my SWEDISH PASSPORT (hint hint: Swedes don\'t normally illegally immigrate to the us because us healthcare and job market is shit compared to ours) is that my name is male and my legal sex is female.\nThey interrogated me, lied to me for 4 hours and ruined some of my belongings. They had found one tiny excuse to use to argue for their claim that I was trying to immigrate illegally, and they skewed anything I said to try to fit that claim. They even made false information reports/records of the event by claiming I had answered ""yes"" to the question ""are you a lawful resident of the united states?"". They rushed and pushed me to sign the paperwork that sneakily claims this without reading it thoroughly, by claiming that my plane back to sweden was about to leave and I had to be quick.They isolated me and refused to let me reply to my mother\'s worried messages. On the 9 hour plane back home I had to sit and stare at a phone that was blown up with heartbreakingly worried messages from my family, without being able to reply. They thought I had been kidnapped and begged me to answer just to show that I was okay.\nThe police used the wrong pronouns and asked very odd questions regarding me being transgender.The whole event had me an emotional wreck for a full month afterwards, I had moments of physical panic where my heart would race and it would be difficult to breathe and I couldn\'t figure out why.

413,Tapas 30-Day Writing Challenge!,Events | Challenges,[],"The new year is almost upon us! For all of you aspiring writers out there, we invite you to join us on our 30-Day Tapas Writing Challenge starting Jan. 1st74!
You’ve probably heard of National Novel Writing Month, or even National Novel Writing Day, where challengers take on a 50K-word novel. The Tapas Writing Challenge isn’t nearly as intimidating. All you have to do is write a page a day -- about 400 words/day (12-pt font, single-spaced).
We want you to channel those writing goals, wishes, and hopes you've always made, but never executed. Channel them and make it happen in 2017. Maybe this is the year you finish your novel. Maybe it’s the year you commit to a sustainable writing habit. This could be the year you get published. Better yet, published on Tapas!
Just start writing on Jan. 1st! Follow the story that has been in the back of your mind and create a world for readers to dive into. Make that first page matter, then the second, then the third. After 30 days, you’ll have the beginnings of an incredible story, and a page-a-day routine that you can continue for the rest of the year.
Then on Jan. 31st, pitch it to submissions@tapasmedia.co for the chance to become a published author. The result will be the best writing year you’ve had yet!
The 1st Place Challenge winner will be published on Tapas with a cash advance of $500! 
2nd and 3rd Place winners will also be published on Tapas.
Only submissions pitched between Jan. 31st and Feb. 7th will be considered for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place prizes.
We can’t wait to read your stories!

Tyler Kinney of Greengarten and myself recently collaborated on a beautiful masterpiece. This beautiful masterpiece.

So we decided to start up a caption contest!
This contest will go on from March 3rd to March 10th. One week.There will be three winners, and each winner will receive 5k.I personally feel as if some of the contests I've come across have very little reward for a disproportionate amount of effort, so I believe this to be a fair reward! All you have to do is come up with a beautiful caption to match this even more beautiful picture!
If you'd like to know, the names of these characters are Fish-Sherman and Felix.

Now it wouldn't be fair to start up a contest like this and NOT shill our work! I feel like it's obvious, but I'll go ahead and say that while we would love anyone interested in subscribing, a sub will have NO bearing on your caption winning the contest.
I will start off with my comic then.
Dreamwalker Felix is about a grumpy teenage boy who recently discovers he has the uncontrollable and dangerous ability to enter the dreams of those around him while he sleeps.



Greengarten1, a sci-fi superhero comedy about a space rock that turns into a person.


Once again I would like to reiterate that your subscription will have no bearing on if you win or not, but we'd love it if you checked out our comics!We look forward to see your captions!","['Caption: A moment of ecstasy between a dominant and his submissive.', ""C'mon people, I don't want one person winning the whole pot!"", 'Caption: How it feels when exams come around.', 'Fish-Sherman: HUMAN!

420,"Design a Comic Event (50,000 Coin Grand Prize) [FINISHED]",Events | Challenges,[],"NEXT EVENT NOTICE:
 The next event will be no less the 4 months away and will have a pay out of no less then 100K for 1st, 50K for 2nd, and 20K for 3rd. 
This does mean that the next event could be stretched out farther than 4 months but at the same time it means the prize for the next event could be raised from 100k.  Hope to see you then!

I have done it! i reached 100,000 coins on the Tapas app using free ads!


1
And with this comes a fun little event  that I've cooked up.
Design a Comic Event
In this event you are tasked with creating a comic using characters from my series Marked13, but the characters you will be using will be listed here on the event page on the forums.
The comic you create can be based around anything (Action, Love, Comedy, etc.) EXCEPT for the following:

BL (Boy Love)
GL (Girl Love)
Eroticism (Nope sorry you can't make anything erotic, sexual, or anything of that sort - This does not mean you can't have a character shirtless or in a swimsuit, it just means they be can't doing anything sexual)
Nudity (Does not include comedic nudity underwear permitted) (Does not include shirtless male characters)
Religion or Anti-Religion (The series it'self is based around biblical events but to keep drama out of it I'm placing a ban on religious subjects)
If want to do something but FEEL like it could be part of these exceptions it is better to ask than hope it won't be disregarded.


Entry Requirements
To enter this event you MUST have tipping enabled on your account as it will be the method of giving out the prizes

Prizes
Grand Prize (1st place)
50,000 Coins
2nd Place
20,000 Coins
3rd Place
10,000 Coins

Usable Characters
The setting of the comic can be anywhere you want (Or even blank space), but the characters are limited to certain (released) protagonists shown below: (I would suggest reading this whole part and not skimming)
Kenta Orune (Main Protagonist) 


 



Sako 

1

Moto 


 



Xepher 

1
 



Lilly Madone 



The Angelomachinas 

1
 


 



And any of the currently seen demons 


 


 


 



(President Justin Giman is half demon and is not on the list)

Judging
The judging of this event will be based on a many number of things:


Art (Good art improves chances)

Story (A well thought out storyline helps in the long run)

Length [In Pages unless it is in a long ways format] (While length is not a massive factor it may help to get your story across)

Accuracy (This is a pretty large factor when I'm talking about accuracy I'm refering to how the characters act, look, and feel.  This is where it would probably be a good idea to not only read the comic but also look at my DeviantART1 for information, as there are some things here and there that have been unreleased on the comic it'self as of yet)

Quality (This kind of goes hand in hand with art and story but more has to do with it's overall feel and how it would affect the viewer emotionally (May also be known as emotional impact), this is a factor may or may not be huge and could put you ahead of the game)


Due Date
Your comic must be finished by:March 10th 2017 at 11:59 AM

Hosting
Since the forums uploading is STILL BROKEN!  The comic/mini-comic can be hosted anywhere you'd like as long as you can link it back to the forums.

Personal Invitations
This event is open to anyone who would like to participate, these invitations are only to call certain artists who have caught my eye that I would be interested to see attempt this.
@60Six@Lucazu@shazzbaa@whispwill
Tip: I would pay attention to the page released this Monday (March 20th) if you use a certain Angelomachina.Bonus Tip: ""Look"" does not necessarily mean clothing, clothing can be changed accordingly (EX. Swimsuits, suits, and other wears) but when thinking about the characters cloths you should also think about their personality and what they would wear. (And yes I know some of their personalities have not yet been fleshed out, but I think a general idea can be gathered form what is immediately available).Edit Tip: You do NOT have to use all of the characters listed in the Usable Characters tab, those are just the characters you can use.","[""That's so generous of you ^^ Thank you for inviting me! If I have time I'll try to come up with something. I love your comic <3"", 'wow these are some rules', ""There really aren't as many rules as it seems, you can literally put the characters in any situation or scene as long as it's not NSFW or BL/GL.  The accuracy part of judging only applies to what is currently known in the series, as there are MANY things to be released at a later time, in which I might hold another contest with way more to work with, but I guess we'll see how this one turns out."", 'oh ok then good luck with that', ""It's good you don't want anything notoriously homophobic like BL or GL! Good luck!"", ""Not really sure if you're being sarcastic or not...  If you're wondering why I don't want BL or GL it's not because of anything homophobic it's simply because I don't like BL or GL comics.  Both of them (BL especially) are very big on Tapastic and from what I've noticed it's an easy way to get subscribers (Not to say the creators of those comics don't put effort into it, it's just has a large following on the site) and my comic has nothing to do with either of them so it just wouldn't make sense."", ""Thanks so much for the invite!! : D I'd love to enter if I find time, though I'm pretty slammed with work on top of my own comic. Still, this is super awesome of you and wish you the best of luck!"", 'Well if you get time you have 3 weeks to work on something ', '\nMid25:\n\nGrand Prize (1st place)\n20,000 Coins\n\nYou do realize that 20,000 coins is the equivalent of $14.17 USD?', 'No sarcasm there. I despise both.', ""Ookaaay?  Good?  Bad?  Indifferent?  I mean 20k coins is quite a lot of coins so I'm not sure what you're saying o.o\nAlso what's the percentage of coins to RL currency?  I can't seem to figure it out :\\"", ""1000 coins is roughly $.80 USD for coins earned through watching ads\nSo @GoldenPlume does have a point that looking at the full scope, roughly $16 Grand Prize, $8 second place, $4 third place, it's not a very big prize for a comic episode contest. Maybe something easier and simpler like a character design contest or fan art contest(?)\nHowever, you have eager people excited about the contest, so don't let this rain on the parade. Just something to consider for next time you plan something cool like this."", ""My next comic event will probably have a 100,000 1st Prize with 2nd being 50,000.  The reason I'm going with 20k, 10k, and 5k this time around is more for a trial run for the next larger event.  And who knows maybe one day  later down the line I'll hold an event with 1M coins as grand prize : P.\nAlso if I earn a certain number of coins before the midway point in the contest I can raise the amount to 50K, 20K and 10K."", ""\nMid25:\nAlso what's the percentage of coins to RL currency?  I can't seem to figure it out :\\\nThe formula we're most comfortable with in terms of accuracy is to divide by 12 and multiply by .85 with earned coins.\nFor example, (10,000 earned coins / 12) * .85 = 708.33 ($7.08 USD)\nWith purchased coins the formula is replace .85 with .55.\nFor example, (10,000 earned coins / 12) * .55 = 458.33 ($4.58 USD)\nWhat is our basis for these calculations?  First off the 12 comes from the Tapas store where $100.00 USD purchases 120,000 coins on the app.  We also had creators we donated over 120,000 coins to back in December report back what their dashboards said they were receiving (before the dashboard was changed to stop showing individual tips due to the load on the servers).  \nThe .85 comes from the known 15% fee that Tapas charges all tips in order to recover the costs associated with developing, implementing, and ongoing support of the Tipping and Watch-to-Earn programs.\nThe .55 comes from the summation of the known 15% Tapas fee and the 30% Google / Apple fee structure that exists for any app that uses their payment platform, regardless of who you are.  Even Pokemon GO has to pay this.  The 30% fee is why you can find Google / Apple prepaid cards sold for less than face value at Best Buy, Costco, Cardpool, etc. at up to 18% off because there's still a 12% margin in it for the retailer and for Google / Apple.\n\nMid25:\nOokaaay?  Good?  Bad?  Indifferent?\nWe're not artists.  We have to hire out all our art.  Everyone does art at a different speed but based on a number of conversations with artists, the median time to do one page of a color comic is 10 hours. That works out to $1.41 an hour, if you should win. If you don't, then your return is $0.  Contests are always a proposition.  You risk/gamble $X or X hours for a Y% chance at $Z value prize.  Given the relative size of Z to X, you're likely to not have a lot of entries."", ""\n\nGoldenPlume:\nWe're not artists.  We have to hire out all our art.

422,ONE DAY ONLY: Get 50% of the coins you tip back as Bonus Coins,Events | Challenges,[],"Ok. 
We're gunna try something. 
We admit it's a little crazy, and its repercussions could send shockwaves through the global indie creator community, but we're going to try it anyway. Because tipping is awesome and so are all of you.
Fair warning though: You might want to sit down for this...
From 4pm (PST) on 2/27/2017 to 4pm (PST) 2/28/2017, all individuals who tip during that time will have 50% of the number (rounded up to the nearest coin) of the coins they tip awarded to them as Bonus Coins (30 day expiration) on 3/28/2017.
...
...
...
I know right? Kinda crazy.  
But there's more. 
The last time we did a tipping event the indie creator community rallied like champs in fairly short order to set a record tipping day (which still stands btw) of over 1.2 million coins tipped.
But THIS TIME since we're giving about a weeks notice, along with a crazy good incentive, the goal for this next event is 2.5 million coins tipped...2.5 MILLION.
Can it be done? Will the global indie creator community be able to rally like that for each other? We have no idea. 
But in less than a week we'll find out.
So, until that time, get your video ads a watch'n, your finger flicks perfected, and your social media machines a humming.
Because come 2/27/2017 at 4pm (PST) IT'S ON!!","['Can these bonus coins be tipped or are they like regular bonus coins that cannot be tipped?\nIs the issue with users only have 2 ads a day fixed and if not is it going to be fixed?', ""Bonus coins are not able to be tipped. But you can use them to buy keys which also helps the indie authors in the key program. \nAlso, different people have different reasons why they may (or may not) be able to watch a certain amount of video ads.\nRight now we are roughly at a 93% fill rate for video ad requests so our providers are filling almost as fast as possible.\nOne suggestion for those who want to mine video ad coins is to periodically do something the ad wants you to do such as visit the website being promoted or downloading the app being promoted.\nIf you do that regularly you will be tagged as an engaged viewer and the ad companies will want to send more ads your way.\nFor anyone having issues watching unlimited ads, try that, and see if it helps any. You don't have to do what every ad wants, but just try it every once in a while."", ""STAFF:One suggestion for those who want to mine video ad coins is to periodically do something the ad wants you to do such as visit the website being promoted or downloading the app being promoted.If you do that regularly you will be tagged as an engaged viewer and the ad companies will want to send more ads your way.\nO_O that's so creepy how ads track individuals...\nI'm having the only 2 ads playing issue too and I do interact with ads. I play the sample game plays when offered, I play videos from the Puppy Bowl and Texas ads, I explore ads for Weekly Bites and Reviewed...\nIf downloading apps is the only way to open up more ads, that's slightly troubling... \nWith the current ad limits I wouldn't be able to rack up the 30k plus earned coins I did during the last event. I'm barely pulling in 1k a day. Something has definitely changed from the last event to today. :./\nAlso, I think just giving out Bonus Coins for the event is a bit lackluster to those that just want to tip and don't buy keys. Sorry, just being honest. ^_^;\nPersonally, Bonus coins are the bane of my existence on the app. They clutter up my coin purse with a false amount that I think is available for tipping but isn't.

I mean, it'd really suck to see all the numbers go to nearly 0 again, but since the bonus coins we get last for 30 days, maybe I'll have to reconsider to how many coins I need to buy out Silent Horror Z until that expiry date... hmm.\nPersonally, I don't really mind these kind of promo events, I don't really expect to have a buyback of coins I would later use for tipping, since, again, like other people have said, it will be a loss on your side, and I'm sure a lot of people don't want that.

423,Cover Art Trade 2017 Sign Ups,Events | Challenges,[],"Welcome to the Cover Art Trade Event! ((Or CATE if you want.)) So here's how this is gonna go, as a means of promoting fellow creators and their comics, we are going to have an art trade event where artists will be assigned to create a variant cover for another artist. 
So how will this be done, you may ask. Well it's quite simple.
Each artist that wishes to participate will provide a link to their comic, their name/username, and of course the name of their comic, and if they want can provide ref sheets to their characters ((since the image upload function on the forums has been a bit screwy as of late, if you are dealing with this problem you can provide links instead of uploading an image to this forum))
Once we have gotten at least 10 artists signed up for this by January 19th, we can begin. Artists will be randomly assigned to one another to create a special variant. On January 20th, you'll be assigned your artist.
I'll be joining in on the fun as well, but without further ado, let's begin!

424,Become a ghost for Heroes of Thantopolis’s second Tapastic anniversary!,Events | Challenges,[],"It's the second anniversary of my webcomic, Heroes of Thantopolis16, being posted on Tapastic! Last year I drew some of my top commenters as ghosts. This year, I'm bringing the ghost designs to you! I've created a simple template to help my subscribers (and anyone else interested) create their own ""ghostsona!"" 
The power is in your hands to imagine yourself as a ghost. I've outlined some basics of how ghosts in HoT are designed, like their coloration, bodyshape and tail shape, but you can add details like accessories or powers! 
Then, once you've created your ghost character, you can email it to me (zizzy25 at comcast.net) or publish it privately on my Tapastic page (https://tapastic.com/Strontium). There's a high chance you'll see your ghost design in an upcoming chapter of the comic! That's right! A free cameo -- all you need to do is supply me with the design. 
Here's the template so you can get started! 
I want to thank all my readers and subscribers for helping HoT get to 5,000 subs! I also want to thank @michaelson for being a really great admin and giving me some cool opportunities during this year of my comic on the site. There are some big moments coming up really soon in the comic that I absolutely can't wait to share with everyone!

425,Comic of the Week Promotion Idea,Events | Challenges,[],"I had an idea for something we could try here on Tapastic that I've seen done successfully in other forms: a Comic of the Week promotional activity.
The basic idea is that a bunch of people sign up, we randomize order, and each week on one of your updates that week you plug a link and a blurb about the Comic of the Week.
One of the nice things about it is that it reaches no only creators (a la ""Comics with X subs"" posts here), but also to the readers of all the comics participating.
So, first, anyone interested? I'm thinking committments to doing so would include:

Having a comic that is currently updating at least once a week.
Probably isn't completely NSFW (porn comics, etc) so that everyone can feel comfortable linking to the Comic of the Week.
Commit to plugging and promoting each comic that signs up for the stretch of the promotion.

Depending on interest we may even have to put a max on it, or change it to be 2 comics a week, etc.
So, first, what's the interest on doing something like this?","[""I guess it'll be cool to add Jim's Days into something like this  My only question is, how long is this commitment going to last? :U"", ""Yeah, that's the thing, it would depend on how many people signed up. So maybe it would need a max so that it doesn't stretch out TOO long. Or we could conceivably divide it into genre subpools or something."", ""True true, but what I mean is whether or not you're in the pool forever? :U Maybe have like an X amount of months to be placed there or something so it's not always the same content? :U"", ""I'm with Zetsubonii on this. Sounds like a cool idea."", 'Oh yeah it would be a limited run, sign up period, deadline, no more new entries, etc.', ""While I fully support the community spirit in this, the possibility of promoting a comic that you might not be personally interested feels iffy to me (I can't be the only one with highly specific tastes, right?). As a reader, I would see it as an advertisement rather than a recommendation, and that would not be a positive experience.\nI can't think of any ways to address that, though, because letting participants pick and choose the comics would go against what this is about. Hmm... Anyone else got thoughts about this issue?"", ""I think this is a great idea! I'm with @keii4ii in that I don't want to advertise a comic that won't be appealing to my readers. You can always split it into genres though.  And if it's split up you can have a set number for each genre, so more people can participate.Just my two cents, either way I'm signing up my comic Fear Full1."", ""a different plug every week? i could do that so long as i keep the plugs in the update descriptions and on my wall. i think its a good idea, and could develop a community of creators supporting eachother - id prolly want more regulations than 'keep it safe for work,' though. like, some people could disagree with a comics content on a moral ground, what leeway would they have to not plug it when its their turn?\ni think it would work better if it was more a friendgroup / community project; if a creator doesnt like a particular comic, they could still plug it but put in way less effort. if you set up a chatroom or something and become friends within the group, though, the support would be quite genuine.

Maybe just rephrasing it as not beinga personal Rec (unless you are sincere) and more of a ""I\'m participating in X event, check out this week\'s comic of the week"" blurb, which is accurate even if you don\'t personally like the comic being plugged?', 'that could work, but might turn readers off. i think if you have your selected uses, create a DM post linking them all to a discord server (which afaik is easy to set up? or smth similar) and ig whoever doesnt come and get to know everyone else is dropped bc like, thats part of the deal. fostering connections and networking - plus promotion.', ""Yeah that sounds good, but maybe we should have a comic for each section of tapastic.

428,FANtastic Friday: 1 Day 1M Coins Tipped Goal (02/03/17),Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone!
Golden Plume here. Most may not know who we are and what we do, but to those who do, they are aware that we are hard at work behind the scenes trying to help Tapastic grow.  We serve the community purely on a volunteer basis because we believe in you all so very much.  
Sometimes what we do works, and everyone is able to see the results.  For example, the feature story we were able to secure for Tapastic back in September in Make Mine Indie.  Other times what we do doesn't pan out at all.  For example, securing a featured panel at a comic convention with exposure to 10,000s attendees and potential new readers.  These things you don't hear about because they didn't work out.  
Unfortunately, more often than not, things don't work out because all too often things are outside of our control.  But that doesn't stop us from trying again and again.
Now (finally!) we have the chance to do something that is completely within our control.  Interested?  Read on.
Currently we are doing our darnedest to help spread the word about Tipping.  So far the comic industry media is being really resistant to report on it.  (Trust us this is really common with a lot of new things.)  What we could really use is a bit of help from the community that won't take much effort at all.
Here it is:
If you are currently tipping daily, or are planning on tipping soon, please defer all of your tipping until Friday February 3, 2017.
That's it.
You don't need to change who you are going to tip or anything else, just please do it on Friday.  If you are going to tip next week, please try to tip early, this Friday instead.
What we are aiming to accomplish is to hit 1,000,000 coins tipped on a single day.  ""On January 26th we came SUPER close to having 1,000,000 coins tipped in one day."" (Direct Staff Quote)
We would like to hit 1M coins on Friday, if at all possible, because we're submitting an article for Tapastic that is due shortly thereafter and we would very much like to include the 1M-Day milestone.
We have 21,000 free coins banked for Friday ourselves and we hope that others would be willing to pledge to save up for Friday or tip early and help the community break a big number.  The hope is that the more major milestones we can crush, and the sooner we crush them, the more likely the media will take notice and report on Tapas Tipping which will open everyone up to even more readers, subscribers, and tips.
Help Tapastic.  Help yourself.  Help your fellow creator.  Please consider tipping this Friday and together we can break 1,000,000!7Let's go for the gold!
Thank you for your consideration.

429,Tapastic Blind Date Art Trade sign ups! (CLOSED),Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone! Jonny Aleksey (creator of The J-Man Web Series5 & The Valve Web Series1) here. I do art trade type events every so often in the forums, which you can see here:
Alternate Universe 20154
Monster Mash 2015 (for Halloween)1
Secret Admirer 2016 (for Valentine's Day)11
Character Cosplay 20162
Battle Royale 20164
I hope you all had a good Holiday season. As we begin this new year, the next major holiday to look forward to is the lovely Valentine's Day. And what do we love more than Tapastic characters?
The way my art trades go is that after the sign up deadline passes, everyone gets someone else's character from random and draw a picture with both your's and their characters doing whatever the theme is. Last Valentine's, we had everyone's characters give gifts to the person they got (you can see the gallery in the link above). This time, we will have the characters go on a blind date. Where they go, what they do,  how they got there, and how they act is entirely up to you.
How to Sign Up:
Comment below like this:

Your Name
Your Comic Name/Link
Your Character's Name
Your Character's Reference Image
Whether or not you can do another image if someone drops out

When you're Done:
Send the image to me through a Private Message on the forums. We want everyone's gifts to be a surprise until release day, so only send them to me. Make sure to tell me who you are and who your picture is for. And please make sure your image is 940px wide.
The Due Dates:

January 13th - Last Day to sign up. You should get your person soon after.
February 11th - Due Date for your images.
February 13th - The Gallery goes live on the forums for everyone to see

Anyone who is late still has a chance to get in the gallery after it launches. Please tell me before the due date whether you'll be late or if you must drop out.
I look forward to seeing all the lovely and/or hilarious pictures you make! 
Oh, and I will be participating!

430,The 3rd Annual Time Gate Shipping Stream - Want a Shout-out?,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everybody! Uzuki Cheverie here, creator of Time Gate: Reaper, fellow Tapastic reader, and community member here in the forums!
Every year since we started Time Gate's comic adaptions in 2014, we've hosted our Shipping Stream, in celebration of Valentine's Day - a stream where we urge our readers to ship Time Gate's characters in all sorts of combinations, from the reasonable, to the insane, and everything else in between! Then we take the ships, draw them during a public livestream, and post the final results on Valentine's Day!
This year's stream will be held ...
Sunday, February 12th, at 6 PM AST/2 PM PST!
You can find our stream channel here!1
We're really pushing ourselves to make this a grand event this year. As per tradition, we are once again shipping our characters (this time with even more characters!), but we're stepping it up by including a new co-host to work alongside myself during the event. We're gonna chat with our readers, talk about Time Gate and comics in general, do a Q&A, laugh at our comedic antics - all to the wonderful tune of only the cheesiest and most memorable love songs, suitable for the Valentine's season <3 
Alongside our event, we figured we'd give back to the community! 
https://i.gyazo.com/628ad89b7f451bea0a946b3610a049fe.mp4
Want to get some extra exposure? Submit your comic with the link and a short description, and we'll try and fit it into our magical revolving banner during the stream! A little goes a long way! And we'd love to feature some of the awesome comics from this community during our stream!
And remember, you don't have to be a Time Gate reader to attend this event (though it certainly helps!) With myself and my co-host running the event, we're planning on making it a real fun time for everybody :> If you like watching drawing streams, or listening to love songs, or just hanging out with Tapastic and LINE Webtoon peeps, we'd love to have you!
See you all this Sunday! <3",[],0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

435,Sexy Art Challenge - January!,Events | Challenges,[],"6
Birthday
Interpret this however you’d like! New beginnings, cycles, even birthday suits!
The deadline is 25 January 2017 since we’re just starting the challenges again! We’ll try to get it down to two weeks gradually, but this time we should just concentrate on getting used to the challenge! Try to get as much done as you can in the next two weeks -- the rest is a grace period!
If you’re not sure how to proceed, just check the FAQ19 and let me know if you have any questions or need help! It goes without saying (but I'm going to say it anyway!) that those who shouldn't be participating probably shouldn't, and those who do participate should be okay with the nature of the challenges, which is all outlined in the aforementioned FAQ. Check it out!
If you intend to post anything from the challenges at Tapastic, please be sure it's within the rules! We don't want to violate Tapastic's terms of service. That's why the challenge officially takes place at tumblr, because it's a free, quick, and easy platform for microblogging.
How To Participate
Hop over to tumblr4 and grab a free blog, if you don't already have one you want to post from. When you finish the art for the challenge, post it at your blog. Then grab the URL and go to the Submit13 page. On the pull-down menu where it usually says Photo, select Link. Paste in the URL and submit! The official blog will reblog your submission from that URL. It must be a tumblr blog so that it can be reblogged, please note!
Have fun! I look forward to seeing your fabulous art!","['The deadline is my 22nd birthday LOL', ""Happy birthday in advance!!  That's awesome and I hope you'll have a wonderful one!"", ""Lovely initiative, there's indeed too much awkardness around nudity.

You have plenty of time to participate, and I'll be posting a reminder in another day or two to keep it on people's minds! "", ""Hello hello everyone!\nJust a reminder after the first week:\nThe theme is Birthday! You're free to interpret this however you'd like!\nThe deadline is 25 January 2017, so that means you have about two more weeks to get everything done! We have a submission already, so be sure to go check it out6!\nLet me know if you have any questions, and check out the original post at the top for more details!\nThanks so much again for everyone who's participating! You're awesome for being a part of this!

438,Live Stream Events,Events | Challenges,[],"Live Streams are exciting, are they not? I feel as though it's easier to focus on drawing when watching a live stream- which sounds kinda silly, but I think it is akin to doing homework with a friend =P 
Whatver one appreciates Live Streams for, I think it's well agreed upon that the more you have joining, the merrier. Typically. So, while those who I follow do tend to live stream often, there are days or weeks where there's no such activity- and that's no fun! I dare say I wanted to ""poke"" tapastic for it to do something. 
So! If you're somebody who has a live stream event coming up, or even if you livestream often and simply want to let people know, go ahead and give us the details here! I'm thinking it'd be effective if there was one Topic where people could update their live streaming status, or let the site know when a big event is coming up! I'd love to tune in to people I may not necessarily be following =D
[Edit] There is another Topic similar to this, although it is older and has stopped updating- so I'll link to it here so we can either keep adding to that list, or make another list here! http://forums.tapastic.com/t/what-is-your-livestream-when-you-do-streaming/2102?u=cyndifoster6

439,Secret Santa 2016 PRESENTS!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey hello Secret Santas of Tapastic!  
Some of you have participated in the Secret Santa event JJ organized16. But JJ's probably too busy to share the Christmas presents we made. So to make JJ's life a bit easier, (and becaue I'm impatient)  it'd be nice if everybody just shared the present(s) they made by themselves in this thread. 
You don't have to if you want to keep your identity a secret!!!

Template how to share your present:

Tag the person you made the present for
Post the picture you made (Because of a bug in the forums, you'll have to upload the picture somewhere else [examples: DeviantArt, Imgur, Twitter, anywhere]. To post it here, just copy the URL of the image, and paste it in your post
I recommend also posting a link to the highest quality of the picture. So add the file to a dropbox, google drive, attached to your DeviantArt file, an online cloud, anywhere. Because WHO doesn't love HD pictures?  

","[""@ryoko\nHey there Ryoko! I was your Secret Santa!! Here's  a Link to the HD file3.\n\n@SirHellsir\nYo hello Sir Hellsir, I was also your secret Santa!

440,❆ Taps Holiday Collab 2016 - Last Day Collabs from the Community❊,Events | Challenges,[],"It's starts TODAY! Yay!
Each day 2 artists on the main site will release their holiday collab episode on their series. The hub series25 that we made is a directory that can be followed to to keep informed of who's posting each day.
Like last year's Winter Festival on the forums2, I'm setting up a forum thread where the posting artists for the day can share behind the scenes stories from their episodes (how they came up with the idea, art style, techniques, and such). Some artists don't yet have profiles on the forums, so for them you may just get me rambling on at how great their series is and why I'd recommend it.
This year's group of participating artists is closed, however we're encouraging the community to join in [just like last year] 3and we'll post any shared artwork from this thread located here25 at the end of the collab hub series after Dec 25th.

They must be stopped before it spreads! 😊', ""Looks really cool, guys! Can't wait for a great Tapastic christmas~!"", ""[Moving this from the OP to a reply post since I condensed this in the OP]\nDay 1 - Shane Butt and Tasha Butt\n@TetheredComic and Shane (no forum handle currently) are two super loving cute insanely twisted sweeties on Tapastic. \nShane's series Beefpaper an autobiographical comic series about Shane and his best friend/fiancé and the crazy adventures and day to day antics they get into.\nAnd @TetheredComic/Tasha's series Hoi Butt! is a diary comic where Tasha shares more fun wacky antics with Shane but also a few episodes sharing my personal insights and stories.\nAfter reading both Beefpaper and Hoi Butt! you're bound to smile and fall in love with these two eggs ♥"", ""Day 2 - BabyKittens and Tales From The Well\n\n@pollyprrfct24's series Ears and Whiskers1 an autobiographical comic series on BabyKittens' life post graduation and how it can sometimes feel like something straight out of a sitcom show.\n@jacintawibowo's series Tales From the Well1 is an all ages fantasy following a boy prince who falls down a cursed well and goes on creepy adventures in the underworld.\nBaby Kitten's series will have you laughing with situational comedy while JesnCin will have you on the edge of your seat on an adventure. Check them out and see what the hype is all about. ♥"", ""I really wish that I knew that there was a Tapastic forum so I could've tagged along for this."", 'Day 3 - KariSpinz2 and Burning Bright2\n\nKari\'s series KariSpinz follows Kari\'s day to day with four cats and creating comics with a fun comical spin.\n@ErithEl \'s series Burning Bright is a Fantasy/Adventure/Romance comic about two friends who accidentally open a portal to another world – only to discover it was all part of someone else\'s twisted plan.\nKari\'s series will give you a big case of the ""D\'aw"" and laughs, while ErithEl\'s series will take you on a ride through deep fantasy lore and complex characters. Both will have you checking back for more updates. ♥', ""Day 4 - I, Mummy2 and Heroes of Thantopolis2\n\n@apurviance's series I, Mummy follows an impulsive teenager turned mummy and investigates her murder with the assistance of a cantankerous ghost.\n@Strontium's series Heroes of Thantopolis is an all ages fantasy series following a young boy named Cyrus who finds himself in the city of the death and the Queen Helene's champion.\nThese two undead themed stories are brimming with courageous main characters and lots of heart. I, Mummy and Heroes of Thantopolis are a must read for any Fantasy/Adventure loving webcomic reader."", ""Yeah! Today was my day!\nI'll talk a little bit about my idea. Since Helene is a goddess from a non-Christian religion, it didn't make sense for her to be celebrating Christmas, so I decided she'd celebrate the Winter Solstice instead. It made more sense when I recalled a story I'd already written about Helene and Cyrus going to a party for the Summer Solstice held by another one of the gods from her pantheon.Of course, nobody told Trickster (the purple guy) that it wasn't a Christmas card, so he wore his Santa hat anyways. \nFun fact: Cyrus's jacket is actually a modified version of his Hero's Tunic! We haven't seen much of this in the comic yet but Cyrus can change the appearance of his tunic into another kind of shirt or top at will. His pajamas are actually his tunic in pajama form!3\nI can't wait to see everyone else's entries! Also thanks Andy for the sweet (as in heartfelt) inclusion of my characters in your comic! It warmed my heart!"", 'I\'m a little late to my Holiday comic coming up! But here\'s some insight into the process behind the comic:In terms of writing, we wanted to reintroduce the story and characters to readers who may not be familiar with Tales from the Well (if they\'re new coming from other series in the collab or from the Daily Snack). We wanted to set the mood with both the art and the writing style (engaging humor and ""childish"" dialogue)2These are the thumbnails, where I scribble down the ideas and lay out the scenes. Color doesn\'t usually apply to the comic-making process this early, but I like having a plan for my colors this early so a draft (or what I like to call a ""color barf"") of the colors is here too.Here\'s an example of what the roughs look like on the fourth page (mainly for BabyKitten\'s characters). Sometimes I skip the roughs and go straight to inking (like the rest of the cameos in this page) for that doodly line quality. Here\'s the process for the lineless ""children\'s book style"" that took most of the comic\'s style. We\'ve been developing this style for a while.The biggest challenge for us was integrating the Tapastic mascot in a way that didn\'t break the flow or didn\'t stylistically match with our characters. Thankfully:Tales from the Well has lots of weird monsters XD We did end up playing around with the Tap Mascot\'s design a bit to integrate him into the world more, even if it\'s something silly like devil horns and tail, it adds to the ""cute creepy"" atmosphere of Tales from the Well. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKED HOW HE TURNED OUT! I am over the moon about this. So gosh darn happy.Tales from the Well is a fairytale first and foremost. We don\'t want it to be grounded on reality (there are no real countries, religions, etc) and want it to be as inclusive as possible. We decided to keep the holiday spirit in a way that was non-religious and more as a ""safe travels"" message.\nI hope that was some fun insight from us! We really enjoyed this year\'s collab, and are wishing the best for the rest!', '\nAH! So cool! \nLove reading all these behind the scene art process posts, and tid bits that might of gone unnoticed. It\'s like an ""Art of Book"" in mini post form.', ""I'm late, here, but the inspiration for my episode from Burning Bright came from me wanting to draw Bran again. I think people are missing him a little (myself included). I was thinking of doing something fun and upbeat, but it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the comic, so that's why it's a little more somber than (probably most of) the others.\nThe costumes were fun to design - and were inspired greatly by the fact that I was rewatching Avatar the Last Airbender at the time. The costume design from that show is just so good!  \nI'm really looking forward to the rest of the episodes. The ones posted so far have been so good! ^_^"", 'Can I make one and upload it? ', ""Sure, of course! XD\nThere's another forum thread set up for community members to participate. Any artwork shared in this linked thread post2 I'll include it at the tail end of the collab series after the 25th with links back to your series.\nMore info here2."", ""Day 5 - Boulder and Fleet2 and The Other End2\n\n@jerzydrozd's series Boulder and Fleet: Adventurers for Hire1 follows a bear and a bird, traveling the world and righting that which is wrong.\n@neilkohney's series The Other End1 is a hilarious webcomic about three kids trying desperately not to kill each other and funny situational moments.\nBoulder and Fleet is an all ages fantasy adventure with a heart of gold and meaningful morals to their tales, while The Other End will appeal to the mischievous inner child in us all. Two great series that I can't recommend enough!"", 'Day 6 - English Project Shorts2 and Wingless: The Dovecote Princess2\n\n@vincentprendick series English Project Shorts3 is an autobiographical comic showing how Vincent is just like everyone else. Trust him. \n@winglesscomic\'s series Wingless: The Dovecote Princess is a dark fantasy story about an unusual girl named Ephelia who wants to be a knight. Mature audience warning as there is gore.\nEnglish Project Shorts is a fun relatable situational comedy that has on several occasions made me go, ""Oh man, yep, I know the feelz."" And Wingless is a beautiful comic series that toys with cute character designs with extreme gory images all while telling an engaging fantasy story.', ""Day 7 - West1 and The Black Bull of Norroway2\n\n@ScampiCub 's series West follows Jed, a Soul Hunter moving between the world of the living and the land of the dead, a lone wolf that finds himself embarking on a journey when ravenous souls inhabiting the West turn to war.\n@kitandcatcomics' series The Black Bull of Norroway takes place in the land of Norroway, unfamiliar and uncompromising, and follows the teenage Sibylla who doesn't know the rules to the game she's been swept up in. Betrothed to a monster who might once have been a man, she must find a way to break an ancient curse, and keep her humanity in the process.\nBoth West and The Black Bull of Norroway are grand scale series that'll have you feeling like you're embarking on a journey along side the main characters with surprises around every twist and turn in the path."", ""\nSome roughs from West's Christmas Collab. The whole thing ended up being a lot longer than I expected (twenty three pages or something). Drawing it out was the easy part, the hard part was the lighting. I'm not that good at grayscale and trying to achieve the right atmosphere for inside/outside scenes was tough. Obviously the outside scenes were far easier, using mostly whites and light grays, but the inside ones were much more complicated. It was loads of fun, though, and I enjoyed sharing previously unknown information about Jed that gives us a bit more insight into his character (we see his Dad, learn his last name, etc). Loved having Petra from the Black Bull Of Norroway in there too. Kit and Cat were excellent to work with and I'd happily collaborate with them again any time.""]",11/28/2016 8:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

443,Sexy Art Challenges! - any interest?,Events | Challenges,[],"Some years ago, I used to run the Sexy Art Challenges on tumblr, since it was always a quick and easy way to post and reblog. Recently, I've repeatedly stumbled across the graphic I used to use and started thinking maybe it's time to gauge interest!
Naturally, I don't intend to put anything on the Tapastic forums that would break their terms (and anyway, most people can't post pictures at the moment), so it would take place at tumblr. Accounts are free, and you could even just make a new blog purely for your contributions. Basically the premise is that a challenge is given, the artists have two weeks to complete that challenge, and as they do, they submit the link of their posted artwork to the challenge blog, which reblogs them. That way, the individual artists get the attention on their posts and blogs.
They're called Sexy Art Challenges because there's no real restriction on content, and I wanted to make it an event for adults who weren't afraid of mature content. So many sites out there are needlessly restrictive on what they'll even allow people for their artistic expression, and to me, that's not what art is about at all: art is about expression, and it's important -- and so rare -- that artists can feel free to express themselves. In some ways, I also try to spread awareness of the fact that those of us who do write stories primarily for adult audiences -- or heaven forfend exclusively adult stories! -- are almost always severely limited in our outlets and opportunities, and usually with arbitrary, vague terms that give themselves to nothing quite so much as a witch hunt mentality.
In any case, I'd like to see if there's any interest here! I always love to use challenges and sketch suggestions for warm-ups, and with a good challenge, it can lead to new people discovering work and creators. It's also, for many, a chance to get outside of the usual comfort zone, which just as often traps us in bad habits or, at times, can keep us from really stretching and learning.
So if you're interested, just let me know! We can always cross-post some of the images here (as long as they're within the rules of the Tapastic site, since it's slightly less permissive than tumblr) and post the challenges to make sure people are aware of them. I'm interested in making 2017 a much better year...and a more creative one!","['Sounds interesting! =) Got any examples of what kind of prompts/challenges you used to post, so we have some idea of what to expect?', ""Hey I would be interested, I've been trying to put a little more time into doing art outside of comics, which pretty much didn't happen at all this year and last year x.x\nI don't really draw adult art outside of commissions so it would be a change of pace, though I don't expect I'll be making anything too exciting ^^;; I'm very cheese cake artist, I more enjoy images that tease you and don't show you everything."", ""\n\nAnnaLandin:\nSounds interesting! =) Got any examples of what kind of prompts/challenges you used to post, so we have some idea of what to expect?\nAbsolutely! It was a looonnng time ago though, so everybody I still keep up with has gone through tremendous stylistic developments since then, myself included! The archive is here52, so check it out if you like but, of course, be warned that it's all pretty much NSFW. There isn't anything too explicit as I recall, but it is unquestionably for mature audiences only!\nWe unfortunately didn't have a very long run before RL interfered and, even after spreading out the deadlines to month-long ones, eventually the challenges stopped from lack of participation. I wanted to prevent that this time, so I'm seeking interest before I get it started. \n\nkurapikasuki:\nI'm very cheese cake artist, I more enjoy images that tease you and don't show you everything.\nThat's totally fine! As it says in the FAQ4, it's just a challenge that gives you the freedom to explore as much as you want in that direction, but doesn't require you to be any particular level.\nI'm glad to see some interest!

The reason why I\'d like the art to be posted on tumblr is for primarily two reasons: first, because tumblr\'s rules are much more permissive than Tapastic\'s, so artists will be less restricted and feel a greater freedom to be expressive; second, because image uploading isn\'t working for a lot of people (myself included) on the Tapastic forums, so we\'d have to post them somewhere else anyway, and having a post on tumblr makes it easier to use the image URLs here.\nThere\'s a FAQ page4 that should answer most questions, and I\'ve revised it a little bit to reflect what I wanted to do this time around. It may take a couple of rounds of the challenge to really get it in ship shape, but I think we\'ve got a lot of promise here!\nWould you all prefer doing the first challenge on 15 January and have the deadline be 30 January, or just dive right in on New Year\'s and have the deadline be 15 January? There\'s usually a ""rest week"" between challenges, so it doesn\'t get too frantic. We could even just do one challenge per month at first, if you\'d rather. It\'s really up to all of you! I have plenty of prompts ready.\nLet me know your thoughts and I\'ll get cracking.  ', ""As long as there's a second announcement or a kind of reminder (I do have a series I work on, and school). Then I would love to post a submission, is there a limit I'm allowed to post or is it just one per person?"", ""Oh yes, there certainly will be! My idea is this for timing:\nFirst announcementFollowed by 1 week to workReminderFollowed by 1 week + 1-2 days to workDeadline\nThat way, we'll have 2 weeks plus a day or two flexibility for those who lost track of time anyway."", ""I'm always up for drawing smexy art, so count me in!

I think I'm going to post the first challenge Monday or Tuesday, but I'll give people about three weeks instead of two, plus a little grace period.

444,Tapsters vote on Topwebcomic (Full) - December 2016,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello friendly friends,
Holiday time is approaching.Cold wind is blowing, Christmas lights are twinkling ... and we're still cosy inside, voting!
Time has come to launch the brand new TWC topic for December.This time with a slight variation. It'll have spots limited to 16 voters in total.I might open more if needed.
EDIT: Sorry we're full! Watch out for cancellations or openings.Also check out @jonufele's alternative list5 with userfriendly web interface.Looks very promising! 
Why doing that when we had so many responses?I think having a smaller list would avoid voters getting discouraged by the process.I also think this will encourage active voters to participate and in the end be more efficient.
I'll be following on the stats very closely to see if that restriction is worth it.
If you're new, here's a reminder...This is a follow up thread of the older topic ""Crank your rank up"" that you can find below!http://forums.tapastic.com/t/tapsters-vote-on-topwebcomic-crank-your-rank-up/99072
So what is it about? Quick reminder. You might know Topwebcomic3 which displays a banner from your comic in a huge list. By getting votes every day you reach a higher rank and potentially get more exposure.
What I'm suggesting here is to build up a Tapastic solidarity and exchange votes on a daily basis for the whole month.
I would start a new topic every month, to keep it fresh and members active.That's the reason why we're back for this round in a brand new thread.
Just post your Twc link below and vote for the whole list everyday this month!
If you participated before just mention you want in and I'll take care of the rest!I'm sure you'll see your stats fly high in no time!
Let's climb that ladder up together!

447,Holiday Collab 2016 [And how you can participate],Events | Challenges,[],"Holiday Collab 2016 Community Submissions! XD
The theme this year are holiday cards, either from a holiday celebrated in the series or a holiday the creator celebrates, to send the readers well wishes and cheer. The lovable Tapastic mascot is traversing each of the 54 series to collect these cards so they can be delivered with care. What crazy obstacles will the mascot face? What stories will unfurl? Be sure to check each day to get the full adventure.
We have a hub series on the main site at this link50, where all the collab episodes will be posted after the 25th and I'll include all artwork submitted here at the tail end of the hub series with links back to your comic series.

Already, there's been several inquiries of how to participate and join in. This so awesome! Yes! I can't imagine a better way to spread cheer and good vibe in a time where it feels like it's needed most.
It'd be fantastic to see this year's collab go viral and possibly rival the water bucket strip from this last April Fools' Day. XD
This year's theme is holiday postcards, all holidays are appreciated. It can be a holiday unique to your comic series or a holiday you celebrate in real life. You can have your comic characters writing a holiday postcard to a friend's comic series, or it can be a meaningful postcard pertaining to events unfolding in your series, or it can be fun and meta with a strip about the comic creator writing a card to their readers. Anything goes! If you're having fun with it, you're doing it right.
Things to include to make it consistent with the event:

a full shot of your postcard
the Tapastic Mascot collecting it at the end
a line at the end recommending readers try a series you think deserves some more attention

Feel free to share you finished episodes here in this thread. After the 25th of Dec, I'll collect all the episode shared here and include it at the end of the hub series with links back to your series (like what we did for last year's collab). We'll keep the holiday going a few days long \o/
Any questions, feel free to ask. X3

For participating, this year is pretty locked in and next year... ugh goodness, no idea if I\'m doing it again but hit me up sometime around August and I\'ll let you know if there\'s another one or possibly who else is hosting it. [It\'s so much work XuX]\nBut, we are encouraging others outside the collab to join in. Perhaps spreading cheery holiday card episodes will go viral on Tapastic and we\'ll forget the craziness of 2016 for a few days.\nBasically, cards can be either a holiday specific to your series or an end of the year holiday you personally celebrate [doesn\'t have to be just Christmas this year, all holidays are appreciated].

However I want data.  Instead of speculating I want to back (or abandon) my opinions with hard information.  Using nokogiri in Ruby it is relatively easy to scrape information (views, subscribers, what is currently on the page) from the html, however with all the loading of pages would strike me as potentially resource intensive on your servers. A drop in the bucket compared to overall traffic, but it doesn't need to use that bandwidth.

456,Let’s make a WITCH playlist! (for prizes),Events | Challenges,[],"I'm working on a project that is witch-related. Now seems a better time than ever! But I need your help. I've exhausted all the best 8tracks witch playlists I know, and I've hit a point where I seem to keep running through the same tracks, again and again. That's where you come in! (Don't worry, keep reading -- there are prizes to be had!)
What I'm looking for:
I'm looking for something to get me in the headspace to depict witches when they're at their best. I want to celebrate their separation from mainstream society, their determination of their existences and command of cosmic forces, and their complexity; witches are impossible to pin down and should never be taken for granted. At the same time, I don't want to forget the witch as a being of the night. I want to take advantage of those old legends and images, which are iconic. This witch has to have darkness to reflect the primal energy of nature.
Most of the comic is going to be a highly-stylized and modern gothic feel, dark urban fantasy, with elements of horror and comedy to punctuate it.

I'd like a playlist, minimum 13 songs. It doesn't have to be on 8tracks.com, but it does have to be somewhere I can access it and listen to it!
I'm especially interested in playlists with a feeling of an aesthetic or a soundscape: paint the images you wish to convey, with sound!
If you're a fan of series such as American Horror Story or Salem, you can always be inspired by their complex depiction of witches in different times and extremely stylized aesthetic.

What I'm not looking for:
I've encountered some things a little too often in my listening, and there are a few things that either I don't find inspiring, or I just don't particularly care for. It's nothing against them (or you if you like them), it's just that I don't think they're what I need right now. If you would be so kind, please avoid:

the songs ""I Put A Spell On You"" and ""O Death"".
Lorde and Florence + the Machine.
edgy covers of old or traditional songs.

The Prizes!
I'm offering a full color piece of up to two characters for my favorite playlist! And that's not all -- I'm also going to do a sketch for everyone who so much as assembles a playlist for me and posts it here, of up to two characters of their choice! I've done this in another topic2, so check it out if you want to see the sketches you'll get!
The Particulars
The contest is open from 11 November to 21 November. That's ten days to get your playlists perfected!
Thanks so much for reading, and I look forward to seeing what you share!","['DUUUUUUDE i love witches and im hecka excited for yer comic now cuz it sounds awesome. im not super good with music but this sounds like a cool playlist to have floatin around so ill look for some songs anyway!', ""You have made my day.

Tapsters vote on Topwebcomic. Crank your rank up! (CLOSED)
Hello people,    I am sure a lot of you guys are on Topwebcomics! I must say I am too. And we would all want to see our banner higher on that list!    Then, Let's help eachother out and vote everyday for a list of fellow Tapastic creators. I assure you this is all legal and only artist solidarity.    How does it work: - Post here the name of your comic and the link to your topwebcomic voting page. - I'll add you to the list below - You would then take a few minutes everyday to vote for all the co...




So what is it about? Quick reminder. You might know Topwebcomic12 which displays a banner from your comic in a huge list. By getting votes every day you reach a higher rank and potentially get more exposure.
What I'm suggesting here is to build up a Tapastic solidarity and exchange votes on a daily basis for the whole month.
I would start a new topic every month, to keep it fresh and members active.That's the reason why we're back for this round in a brand new thread.
Just post your Twc link below and vote for the whole list everyday this month!
If you participated before just mention you want in and I'll take care of the rest!I'm sure you'll see your stats fly high in no time!

I'm in this  again pls! :DDDDBe Brave3"", ""Oh thank you, this really helps!  Seeing those examples helps too, cuz I tend to overdo it on how much work I put into stuff that's supposed to just be simple and for fun so doing it once an update with just little things like that sounds way more doable.

458,Tapactivity 2! Where In The World…?,Events | Challenges,[],"Dear Tapastic fellows! ( please think a way to cleverly merge those words ), reading through some forum threads, I realized the amazing diversity of origins for all of us! Having artists and readers from all over the world feels really awesome, kinda overwhelming isn't it?  
That's why this second Tapactivity is focused on getting to know each other's origin story! Of course, if you don't feel comfortable sharing this kind of info, you can use the characters and world from your series too! This way you can also develop a little background and lore for your comic 
Of course, you still can participate on Tapactivity 18, this doesn't mean it's closed! So go ahead if you haven't done that one yet!  
INSTRUCTIONS: right-click / save the image below (a transparent PNG), and open it on your favourite drawing software. If you are a traditional artist, just draw on your favourite medium, scan it and then photoshop it on the image below.When it's ready, post it as a reply to this thread, including a link to your series and your guest's series!

459,Tapastic Battle Royale Art Trade Sign-ups,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone! Jonny Aleksey (creator of The J-Man Web Series3 & The Valve Web Series) here. I do art trade type events every so often in the forums, which you can see here:
Alternate Universe 20156
Monster Mash 2015 (for Halloween)2
Secret Admirer 2016 (for Valentine's Day)6
Cosplay 20166
Based on a vote from the last art trade, this one will be Battle Royale, where two characters will be pit into a death battle.
BTW, Halloween is approaching and @efdvorsky is hosting their own trade for the occasion. If you've liked my trades you should check out their's here.9 
Now on to the rules for Battle Royale:
Like all my previous trades, the way it works is that a participant will random get another's character and make an image with both their's and their own characters. As you've probably guessed, the two characters will be fighting. Whether it's with fists, kicks, guns, robots, whatever; they must be fighting for their life.
You can make your pic as graphic as you want (it's the internet. We don't need to censor ourselves.). However, there is one major rule: It must be a fair fight.
Tapastic is vast website with hundreds of different genres and tones. But this means that not everyone is on par with everyone else like the Marvel Universe. So to make sure no one feels left out, both combatants must be equals. The best way to do this is to give the ""normal"" character something from your universe that gives them an edge.
EX:  - Iron Man's Hulkbuster Armor to fight the Hulk - Batman's Armor from The Dark Knight Returns to fight Superman
That being said, you can have a clear winner if you want. Personally, I think it would be best to keep it ambiguous. But if you do have a winner, don't make it look easy. Give them battle damage. Have them limb. Bleed. Make it look like it took all they had to win.
Beside that, go insane. And remember, we're all equals. 
Sign Ups:
Signing up is simple. All you have to do is comment below with:

Your name (with link)
Your comic (with link)
Character model (preferably colored)
Any info you think would be useful for the fight (powers, weakness, fighting styles, etc)

Timeline:
Sign ups start NOW!
The final day to sign up is Oct 8th. You should get your person the following day.
The deadline for your pic is Nov 11th
The gallery should be up by Nov 13th
And, of course, I'll be participating with my J-Man from The J-Man Web Series3: 
Good fighting, everyone!
The Combatants List:
1.)Name: Jonny Aleksey3Comic: The J-Man Web SeriesCharacter: The J-ManInfo: He can lift about 15 tons, run up to 120 mph, some regenerative powers, extremely flexible, durable, and agile. He is very aware of his environment and has used it to use advantage. However, he has no training or fighting style, which could leave him open to fighters who understand the human body and how to counter attacks. 
2.)Name: WakaXO1 Comic: Neon RabbitCharacter: Dakota HoltInfo: Her power is teleportation, she relies on strategy to win fights rather than strength or weapons.
3.)Name: wnqsComic: The cat, the Vine and the VictoryCharacter: TarowInfo: Left-handed swordswoman, skilled as a mercenary and tough, but still young and learning her family's trade. Would fight to the death for her 'princess'.
4.)Name: Uzuki CheverieComic: Time Gate: Reaper1Character: Uzuki KasaharaInfo: Melee fighter with aura-reading and aura-manipulating abilities (auras are the magical essence of the soul in the Time Gate universe, much like chakra/mana/etc.) As of right now in the story, she's primarily a close range hand-to-hand fighter; the only weapons she uses are knives. Very little physical defense, can go a little crazy at times if you really push her buttons . . . you really don't want that to happen. She's been a murderer since she was a child. Trust me on this.
5.)Name: Kuroe Lee1Comic: After Hours3Character: Kurumi AoiInfo: Just an average Japanese high-schooler, green skirt and black tights with standard loafers. Top-notch kendo practitioner, but prefers to stick with strategies that she's used to, so she's kinda weak to more pragmatic fighters.
6.)Name: ElPsyCongroo1Comic: Knights3Character: Jun KishiInfo: She's been trained in martial arts since she was little. She wields dual broadswords (think Zuko as the Blue Spirit) but they're also uzis. Because it's badass. (Think RWBY, Final Fantasy, gunswords etc) Check out chapter 2 of my comic to see her in action.
7.)Name: Greg DicksonComic: Don't Be A Hero2Character: GeminiInfo:  Gemini is like a jack-of-all-trades with her clawed ball and chain device, Valhalla. Gemini can attach Valhalla to her opponents to vaporize them into essence, which contains their powers that she can use for herself. She stores Valhalla in the palm of her bionic arm [the ball can shrink and grow, kind of like a pokeball] and she can shoot it at her foes (the claws grip her opponent, it activates on a few second timer, then BAM! End of opponent). She also absorbs the fighting knowledge of her opponents to become proficient in their arts. She doesn't have that many abilities yet in the comic, but she has two so far: Spears & Duplicate 
8.)Name: Aspie GamerComic: Life of an Aspie2Character: SusanInfo: Since the real Susan plays lots of video games, she should be an unarmed fighter primarily relying on her fists and kicks. Referencing Super Smash Bros for a bit, her fighting style should be closest to either Captain Falcon or the Mii Brawler.
9.)Name: Elgenar1Comic: Po's Adventure11Character: PoInfo: A ""Piphet"" who possesses a high level of agility and an even higher level of durability. Never been outside his native environment, but can adapt to others quickly. Top speed of 40 MPH on foot. Solely a hand-to-hand fighter, he does not possess a fighing style but uses his speed and agility to probe for visible signs of weakness. When nearing death, will turn feral, gaining strength and speed several times over, but acting only on instinct.
10.)Name: AFroggatt/Kyle K.C.1Comic: Arkian1Character: EveInfo: She's incredibly tough. Not she-hulk tough, but still strong. She is adept with hand-to-hand as well as melee and ranged. The two latter ones would be with anything shiny and white, futuristic with lots of lazers and glowy bits. There is a very slight chance she could channel the divine power of Triberus, but that's so unlikely, it's borderline non-canonical. Triberus seldom intervenes.
11.)Name: Philip Miller1Comic: Requiem for a Grieving Hero1Character: WittorfInfo: Wittorf is a mage who fights defensively. Using a conductors rod to summon musical instruments that in turn cast spells. At his strongest he conducts an orchestra of beautiful death. Wittorf is not trained to endure long battles and pulls back on women. He will do everything in his power to not hurt children but men are fair game. Wittorf is a ladies man and even if he would rather talk a lady up he is not foolish as to let his guard down in combat
12.)Name: JrejComic: Shades Of Men1Character: LevInfo: He's a grumpy hobo living in the streets of Paris. He usually doesn't speak much and avoids social interaction. However when faced with trouble, his inner rage takes over and it ends badly. He is known to take down several men by himself, changing pace suddenly, with raw uncontrolled moves. In the action he shows no fear.
13.)Name: Zac Garmon/Dream Coat GuyComic: Freak of Nature2Character: Freak of Nature/BenInfo: Ben contains a powerful source of blue energy called Exorcism, a power used to ward off evil and heal others, and appears in the form of an ethereal, blue aura that engulfs the user, and can be used as a source of power or ammunition as Ben has discovered. Including his Exorcism, Ben has a high amount of durability, though whether or not this is the exorcism in action or not is unknown, and because he is a cyborg he has inhuman strength and speed. For weapons, Ben has a pair of crimson magnums that he powers with exorcism to fire at his opponents in rounds. However, while Ben has quite a huge amount of potential, his abilities come short currently thanks to his oblivious nature and tendency not to think, leading him to rush in without fully thinking or forming a strategy.
14.)Name: Mike1Comic: Abducted1Character: Asher KlineInfo: STRENGTHS:Asher is the son of a retired lightweight boxing champion. His father began teaching him boxing at an early age, but Asher only recently started to implement what he learned. Since he's so small, his fighting revolves around evasion tactics and counter punches. He practically dodges and pokes at his opponents with jabs until he spots and opening. He recently discovered that he is an Esper and has telekinetic powers. This allows him to move and lift incredibly heavy objects with his mind. He can also create a telekinetic shield strong enough to withstand a hit from a train and can be deployed fast enough to stop automatic weapon fire.
WEAKNESSES:Asher is incredibly timid and will freeze up when terrified. His esper abilities also take a toll on his body, causing nose bleeds and extreme overuse will cause him to pass out completely.At this point in the story he doesn't have complete control over his telekinesis nor does he know the full extent of his abilities. This can be a problem because he doesn't know how long he can use his powers before losing consciousness.
15.)Name: William J BowlesComic: Outcast Kingdom3Character: HildaInfo: Hilda has enhanced strength and durability (not to Superman levels or anything. She can't lift a car over her head, but she could probably flip it over.) She also has armor plates attached to her that provide some additional protection. She is experienced in hand-to-hand combat and the use of a variety of weapons, but is not disciplined or formally trained. Headstrong and short tempered.","['Heck ya, this theme is right up my alley!Name: WakaXO My comic; Neon RabbitCharacter; Dakota Holt Info: Her power is teleportation, she relies on strategy to win fights rather than strength or weapons.[Edit] I forgot to mention, she can also throw objects (anything from a small toy to a car).

End of opponent).  She also absorbs the fighting knowledge of her opponents to become proficient in their arts.  She doesn't have that many abilities yet in the comic, but she has two so far.\n1 - Spear: A chain exits from one side of Valhalla with a glowing green spearhead attached.  The chain stiffens into a handle, with the ball on the back end of the chain, and the spear on the front.  She can fight regularly with it.  She can loosen the slack on the chain and wield it like a bladed whip, and she can even throw it, making it resemble a green arrow of doom.\n2- Duoblicate: I guess it's a little bit of a spoiler, but by my next page, I'll be hinting on it anyways.  She can clone herself once, giving herself an extra teammate on the battlefield.  Two is always better than one!\nGemini also possesses a gauntlet and platform boots that she can magnetize by thought (well, the ribbons in her hair allow her to form a telepathic communication with her own technology), allowing her to grip, walk on metal surfaces with ease, as well as using her gauntlet to pull in metal objects from a distance (sometimes disarming foes), as well as shooting metal objects forward with incredible force, which is how she fires Valhalla at opponents.\nGemini's passive strengths is that she's a cunning strategist, and has excellent acrobatics and stamina.  Weaknesses?  She's doesn't possess extreme strength or durability like many heroes (well, with these abilities anyway).  She's also a little overconfident in herself, which occasionally makes her fumble with mistakes. .\nReally, she's more in line with a Megaman/Cardcaptor Sakura-style fighter, selecting her abilities carefully to get at a leg up on her opponents."", 'Sign me up!

462,My Drawtober 2016 Journey,Events | Challenges,[],"I recently participated in Drawtober. I posted all of my drawings on twitter @shadosassins. I feel proud that I was able to successfully get a drawing done everyday for the second year in a row. I now hope that my improvements, however great or small, start to translate to my comics. (Though next year I might try only environments and backgrounds since it is an area I can greatly improve at. Anyways I wanted to share my journey with you here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3y-MjTxbnGgwLx49zFFXMT3s-cmBJe6d5
If participated in Drawtober, Inktober, or whatever October-themed drawing challenge I'd be interested to know how you did.","[""I was doing really well, but then got swamped with job hunting, birthday happening, and parental visitation.  For mine I wasn't really focusing on anything in particular, I was just trying to get myself to get back to drawing daily again.  Here's a couple of the things I did for it: \n  "", ""I understand what you mean. It's amazing how something that sounds so simple as drawing daily can be difficult when life calls."", ""Right??  You're like hey this drawing only took an hour or so, I can totally find an hour to do this stuff every day, but then nope. At least I was drawing stuff most days it just wasn't for the monthly thing so I guess it's not a complete loss."", ""I love drawing challenges! This year has been full of them. In May, I participated In Wizard War 2016. Later, In September, I participated in the Dungeon Degenerates Monster Drawing Club1. I had a lot of fun with both of those but I had, by the end of each month, fallen off shedule. October was a success, however. I used Craig Gleason's Season of the Bad Guys Club1 list, and was able to finish every drawing on time with no buffer! For November, I'll be participating in the Goblyns Grotto1 challenge, but I haven't started yet. Oh well.You can click on any of those links to see what I drew in that month!

464,2016 Secret Santa MAYBE?,Events | Challenges,[],"Heya people. I'm JJ, creator of Beautiful Lies4. Been on hiatus for a bit, sorry, but anyway
 I've been very busy lately but somehow it occurred to me that I set up the Secret Santa from last year and was wondering if we should do it again. 
Here is the original 2015 SECRET SANTA13
Here is the overview of what we will be doing:- Each person will sign up, telling us who they want to be drawn (and how if they have a preference)- People will be randomly assigned to each other and have a month or two to complete their projects- When finished, you send me the project and I will give them to everyone- After the event, you have the option of posting it in the forum and revealing who;s work you did
Give me some ""yes"" and I'll set it up again. Also, feel free to ask questions","['Yes.\nThis sounds great, and a good way to get to know some folks and see some art. Count me IN!', ""heck yeah, I'd be in! "", ""I'm all ears to this. Yes!"", 'Oooo yes sounds like a blast B)', ""Count me in! I've only done a Secret Santa once (and that was kind of a disaster), so this would be fun!"", ""I would love to participate, I participated in the Halloween Tap event and it was super fun!  And I wasn't around last year during the holidays."", 'All of my yes! I was already hoping someone would start a secret santa event!   Count me in!', 'Hell yeah! This is my first christmas here, and id love to get involved with this!', 'Absolutely! Love me some Secret Santa.', ""Yeys, happy to have some responses. Check out the link I put up if you wanna see how it went last year. It won't be too much different though I made add some changes based on Secret Santa survey.\nI know it sounds early to discuss this but we need plenty of time to work on the projects, yes?"", ""Yes!

465,Tapastic’s Secret Santa! [all assignments given out!],Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone! im glad to announce that Tapastic's Secret Santa is now OPEN for signups!!**Signups are Until December 2 **

hohoho.png2480x2480 417 KB
 
For those who don't Know what a secret santa is
What is a Secret santa?
Secret is basically a christmas event where you give a gift to a person and receive one from another person. the catch is, you don't know who you're giving it to and you don't know who's giving the gift to you! its a fun little christmas event that people can join to have fun and make new friends with!
**That's Cool! how does it work? **
Its really simple really! first things first, you have to signup for the secret santa by commenting on this topic! just state that your joining the secret santa and give your own little request to what you like!
example:""i want to join! for my request i would really like a drawing of a charmander""
after the signups. all participants will be given the person they will make a secret santa for through PM. in which they will be given a time to draw their target's request. (by all means, do not reveal who you are a secret santa to. half the suprise and fun is in the mystery of secret santas!)
after the deadline has been reached. i will post a new thread on dec 25 (or somewhere from the 24th-26) showcasing everyone's gifts and whom they were made for! viola! opening present time! the secret santa can now reveal who made what for who after the presents have been opened!
sounds interesting so far! great! you should join 
but im not a good artist D:
it doesn't matter! everyone loves getting gifts! so even just a simple sketch, draft, or doodle will go a long way! its the thought that counts!
**what happens if somebody doesn't submit his secret santa (intentional or not) **
well first off, please try your best to submit your entry! as i said earlier, it doesnt have to be as grand and well done to your recipient in order to make them happy! and besides, it might give you bad name to be the grinch that put down christmas  
but if ever there was an unfortunate incident like that, there will be such a thing as gift elves who will compensate by doing your request for you! who are the gift elves? actually, aside from me, i actually need some people to be gift elves just in case such incidents happen. don't worry, you'll only need to do extra work if such thigns happen.
with being said if anyone wants to be a volunteer gift elf please do say so in your post it will be a great help for me and others (especially since im handling this event on my own DX)
if you have any other questions, feel free to ask them! i don't mind!
and wilth all that said and done! i declare the SS event open! hope the lot of you are interested! and i hope this event will be a success! lets make this one awesome!","[""I'd like to join.

466,(TRICK OR TREAT PROMO) Your Tapas Media doorstep is right HERE for Halloween!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey all,
Halloween is just around the corner and we know the question EVERYONE is asking themselves: ""How in the world do we trick-or-treat at Tapas Media this year? San Francisco is SO FAR AWAAAAYYYYY.""
Well good news! This year our doorstep is RIGHT HERE; this very thread.
So! on Oct 31st (PST) make sure to stop by and say ""Trick-or-Treeeeeeat"" (or a simple ""Trick-or-Treat"" will do too).
And for those that do, they'll receive TREATS in the form of TAPAS COINS in their Tapas app account (give us a day or two to process plz).
How many coins you ask? Great question.
As with Halloween everywhere, the early birds usually get the most and best treats. Those that come later usually get the treats no one else wanted  . So try to get here early if you can.
But we CAN say that at least ONE lucky trick-or-treater will receive a ONE THOUSAND Coin treat! Will an illustration of you in your costume saying ""Trick-or-Treat"" help you be the one?? It certainly wouldn't hurt. But if we see you coming back twice you better be dressed as something different.

468,Inktober 2016 on Tapastic,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello World!
Autumn has come and It's time to think about Inktober.
If you don't know already it was created by Mr Jake Parker12.It's a challenge over the whole month in which you should post on social media an inked sketch every day in October.
 
It's a great way to sharpen your drawing skills and hit the drawing table by using traditional inking. (Digital inking is fine if you want too...) 
If you do participate, don't hesitate to post your drawings here for everyone to see! I'd love to see what you come up with!
Last year I launch a series called Surviving The Holiday16 where I posted a page a day. It was quite a challenge finding the right story structure to fit the event.
I'm still thinking about this year and might do a cooperative event with one of my friends. We would be drawing a page every other day, building off from each other, writing the story as we go. Could be a good exercise.
EDIT: I ended up making a new short story for Survivng The Holiday called Road Trip Mayhem! Always fun. 
What's your plan for Inktober?","['I hoping to do the extra page update a day thing again this year.', ""Oh that's great. Working on your main series is always a smart move!I like working on shorter stories too. It's nice to draw without thinking about long term developement. Just keeping it simple for once!"", ""I barely draw on paper and not much of a fan of inking. I think for this October I'll  be doing a spooky animation instead :b"", 'as much as I would LOVE to participate in Inktober, the main thing at the top of my list is to finish my webcomic.', ""I didn't know that there was a NaNoWriMo equivalent for authors! I definitely want to try it. I'll probably end up doing shots of my OC's or snippets of fan art. Chances are, 99% of it will be Harley Quinn-esqe. I've done something like this in the past. The photography is crap, but this should be a decent representation of my idea. "", ""Oh that's really cool! That's a good idea! Fan art works quite well for the event. I see a lot of that!Harley Quinn is very trendy right now. Such a cool character. It's gonna be great!\n@indagold I mostly draw on tablet too but it's nice to go back to traditional once in a while.I actually realized how better I got over time.\n@Shanny8 I know the feeling. I'd love to get more pages done on my comic. I realized that I shouldn't work too hard on my main series. I would reach my creative limit on the project and be closer to the burn out. I tend to plan for the distance. A one month project like this really changes my mind and gets the ideas coming. Keeps it fun!"", ""i've been drawing on the computer since I was 6, I guess traditional art just isn't my thing haha..."", ""@Jrej I'm almost finished with my series- buffer wise. I wouldnt mind getting back to bristol & ink myself, but I cant/wont ink a pic a day AND work on my comic- so the comic is priority."", ""Ooh, I think I'll give it a shot. Ink is always fun and I could use the practice. Hm, I'll probably draw a lot of ocs, but I want to work on drawing environments and stuff too!"", ""I'm going to attempt to do a random, hopefully decent quality, ink sketch everyday.  They'll probably be a mix of photo studies, style studies, environment sketches, stuff like that.  It'll be a good opportunity to learn some stuff while goofing off, as well as use my long forgotten brush and calligraphy pens."", ""As usual, I'm aiming for an inked pic every second day in October. I'll try to do quality over quantity (also, I need some time to work on the next chapter of my comic). If any of the inks turn out good, I might bring them to my part of the table I share at Comic Con Stockholm, and try to sell 'em =)I'll probably assemble a list of characters I want to draw, so we'll see..!"", ""I started trying to do it last year,  but between making a comic and working I just didn't have time. Maybe this year though!"", ""It's an opportunity to draw so ething different. Environement is definitely a must.Could be fun drawing from real life for that.\n@Bloomer Oh a brush... I have to try one of those! I plan on going for bold inking pen. I heard brushes are hard to master but give amazing result. A more organic vibe I guess...\n@jennula Every second day sounds great. You definitely don't wanna rush these. I probably have an hour per day in the morning to do this, so can't put that much detail into it. I hope to better the quality by starting a little earlier. \n@mjmassey I was lucky to survive it last year because I had time. This year I wanna start early to get a week of buffer. That's needed for more complex artwork. I could still wing an inked sketch in a couple minutes but that's not the point, right? ....Hehe (Totally gonna do that!)"", ""\n\nJrej:\nOh a brush... I have to try one of those! I plan on going for bold inking pen. I heard brushes are hard to master but give amazing result. A more organic vibe I guess...\nIt takes a bit of practice to get the hang of them, but they aren't too bad once you do, you just gotta know how to work line pressure... without a computer tablet.  I think the last time I used brush pens was in high school, I did a spoof cover for a now dropped project.  The style was meant to parody 70's anime. Ahh~ Good times."", ""It'll be Inktober and straight to NaNoWriMo for me. This month has just been me planning stuff out so I have time to do both :3"", ""I want to give it a shot this year, it will be the first time I've ever done it.  I wasn't thinking of doing a specific theme but I'll probably end up doing a crap ton of fanart. ^^;"", 'I did it last year for the first time, it was good timing for when I started my instagram haha!

Each month an art style is selected based on votes tallied from the previous month.  Then people make art in that style and post the results here along with a suggestion for next month's style.  You can submit artwork after the deadline (oct 31) but you must vote before then.  
Last month was Art Nouveau and you can check it out the awesome art people did in the link above.  You can even submit artwork on last month's thread so long as it's Art Nouveau.
This month will be pixel art.  Here's some stuff to get you started:

Also, our judges are all folks very much worth getting to know! Read more about them and where to follow them here.14
Finally, help us promote the event on Twitter by using the hashtag #eiwAwards -- the event will culminate in December and January with a podcast award ceremony, giving us plenty of time to build a great buzz for the webcomic community!

Does a webcomic that has published the first 22 pages of a 50-page chapter count, or does it not count since the chapter isn\'t finished yet?Does a webcomic that has published the last 22 pages of a 50-page chapter count, or does it not count since the chapter didn\'t begin in 2016?

*Everyone will get a credit with a link to their pages (can be tapastic, facebook, devart, whatever).
*I can only ship to: US, Canada, Germany, UK, EU. I might be able to ship to other places if you want to pay shipping. (But I'm poor, so sorry I can only ship to affordable places)
*Entries can be in color, BW, in comic form, whatever. Also, I'd avoid it needing a NSFW tag. If you are concerned, just message me.

The tables are free, we get lots of space, and there is a ton of foot traffic for the small space. The kicker is that it is promotion only. We aren't allowed to sell anything.
With this in mind, I want to use it to drive traffic to our webcomic and online store. So, what should I bring?
Should I bring comic books as a display? Would people think they are free? Or be afraid to touch them?
Last year we did coloring pages and some small 4x6 flyers. I gave away some left over sticker rejects from the last big show we were at. (Stuff I couldn't sell, because of misprinting or whatever)

479,September Monthly Art Style Challenge: Art Nouveau,Events | Challenges,[],"I've been thinking lately that while making my webcomic I don't have a lot of time to experiment with vastly different styles of art.  So I thought of an interesting idea for a monthly challenge to keep them creative juices juicy.
Basically, you would submit a work of art in a specific style in the thread below.  It can be fan art, an OC from your webcomic, whatever - the only restriction being that it should be in the specified art style.  Along with your artwork you should add a suggestion for what the next month's art style should be.  The style for the next month would then be decided either by how many people advocated for it or by lottery if its a tie.  Styles can be specific to an artist or a general aesthetic (like steampunk).  ""Anime"" might not be a very helpful description of a style - especially since so many people might already consider their work to be within that category.  ""Ghibli"" or ""Trigger"" might be a better one, in contrast.
For the first month we're doing art nouveau
Leave your submissions below along with a style  for next month by September 22.

Remember to have fun =]

480,Fanart Contest?,Events | Challenges,[],"So we are just a few pages away from starting chapter 6 of Goblins of Razard5 and I thought it might be fun to do a fanart contest.

I would also have an episode where I post everyone's art and links to their pages. (All in one episode as to not spam my followers)

481,October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month: Lets Draw Some Slogans to Help Spread Awareness,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello Tapastic community. Aspie Gamer here. As September draws to a close, its that time of year again. No, not Halloween though that is plenty fun and is a good excuse to watch horror movies back to back. No, not Inktober though that's a fun event for artists of all ages and skill levels and is certainly someting I plan on participating in this year. What I'm talking about is that its once again Breast Cancer Awareness Month and I decided now is a good time as any to try my hand at creating an event here in the forums. From Oct. 1st until the end of Halloween, I think it would be pretty cool if as many people here as possible came up with cool breast cancer slogans to help spread awareness of the disease. If you have social media accounts, (who doesn't these days?) don't be shy about showing your slogan to the greater internet. Social media in general is a great way to spread awareness about anything. Or if you have a comic here on Tapastic, feel free to present it there. Its up to you. To help stir up some inspiration, here's a breast cancer awareness slogan I made last year using two OC's from my comic Life of an Aspie1
 
Anyway, if you feel like contributing to this event, here are three rules.
You MUST have pink somewhere in your drawing. It doesn't have to be a pink shirt. It could be a pink band, pink hair, pink hat, PINK the music artist (preferably sporting something that is actually the color pink.) etc.Keep it classy. If your girl is topless, that's fine, just don't show the nipples. Maybe depict a topless woman who had to have a breast removed due to breast cancer but have her arms covering the naughty bits? Now if you are drawing a guy, (yes we do on occasion get breast cancer) obviously the no nipples rule doesn't matter.Have fun. The point of this event is to help spread breast cancer awareness through art. You are doing this because it feels good to help out.",[],0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

484,Halloween activity on Tapastic perhaps? (Tapasween),Events | Challenges,[],"It's never too early for Halloween, my friends, and I think it would be really fun to have a group activity this year if possible!
The topic in mind is simple: Your series' character(s) dressed up as (a) character(s) of another series you read on this site. 
How does this work?
You give a little support and shout out to something you love to read, they get something to enjoy with you.
So on Halloween Day/Night, we would simply post drawings of the results. (It doesn't have a formal name yet, it can be Tapasween for all we want.)
How would we select the comics?
We'll have a formal list of participants on this topic where, like a secret santa, you get assigned one comic, and draw your character dressed as this selection. However, the thing is, it's Halloween! You can add your twist, and if you'd like to add more of your characters in your final drawing (dressed as characters from other comics you read that aren't on this list) that's fine too! Maybe next year they'll join. They'll appreciate it regardless, I'm sure! But keep the chosen character as the focus.) 
It's encouraged, really, that you give a little love to the comics you read even if they aren't on this list. 
Where would this be posted?
Most likely we can keep things organized on this topic, and we'll post it on our comic titled Tapasween or whatever name we can come up with. In the description, we can post the list to give shout outs to the other people participating. This would also depend on the support and amount of volunteers, but it would stay within a small circle for now. 
UPDATEThe [new] deadline has been changed to September 23rd, This gives everyone a month to prepare after they receive their tapasween buddy. 
Again this is just a little fun activity we can do as a group and we can also share our love for the comics we read, love, and support on this site. This is a spur of the moment thing before I forget so suggestions are more than welcome!

1) Efdvorsky's Cosmic Fish2

You\'ll share the hard work, which will make it easier on both of you, and with someone else to watch your table, you can take bathroom breaks when you need them! Bring water and something to snack on. Gotta keep your energy up throughout the con! And take, like, sandwiches or a lunchbox, not just candy. Your body will thank you for it afterwards. Wear comfortable shoes you don\'t mind standing around in a lot. Stand up as much as possible during the con; this puts you on eye-level with the con-goers, and makes it easier to catch their attention and do your sales-pitch. Network with other artists! Even if you don\'t sell much, you might make new friends, find interesting projects, and that will fill up your time between cons.', 'In about 3 weeks I\'m going to table for the first time ever. I\'ve been wanting to do this for like... 10 years now? But it never happened because I was to chicken to go alone and don\'t have friends who go to cons. But I found some guys from my school who table regularly and I luckily got a spot at their table.\nI keep my expectations as low as possible, to be honest. Of course I\'d love to at least break even with my expenses for prints and stuff, but I mainly go there for the experience and to meet new people.I\'ll bring prints of the first chapter of my comic, buttons, prints, but also a little bit of fan art, like self cut Pokemon stickers and keychains. I also plan on offering commissions on the spot, I\'m curious how that\'ll go.Also I\'ll print a lot of business cards and something fun people can grab for free, don\'t know what exactley yet. Maybe miniprints or bookmarks or something like that.\nSo... I don\'t know if I\'m ""ready"" ready, because I\'m bad at selling myself and my art. I just know that I really want to do this and finally took action.', 'I am planing to submit a vending table request at my local Con in 2017. I was excited for that since day 1 but that was cause I love this con and worked it for years. I think it all depends on what you goal is at the con. I would assume selling the book but I see vendor tables at cons especually the first time or two you sell there as more advertisment. I do not expect to make back the money I put into the table my first time. But I do get the feeling I will be able to promote my series to local comic book readers and anime fans ^.^\nSo in terms of emotionally ready I would say prepare yourself to advertise more than sell. Or get to know other creators at the booths. Having a web of local creator friends can help you learn things you did not know.\nThere is a group that has been at the con every year for the last 3 years and whenever their comic is brough up most people in the area know it as the comic that is sold at the con. Since I believe that is the only con they sell it at and they always release the new stuff there.', ""I shared a table with a friend the first time, and I only had some original sketches on little cards.I didn't have prints or books or anything. Some hand made flyers for my webcomic. That's it! And you know what? It was a blast. I think I made back just what I needed to pay my friend for the spot on her table. And maybe enough money for a candy bar. Haha.. And as time went on and the more conventions I go to and vend, I've improved and done much better. Every year better than the last.\nYou dont need to have a huge display and thousands of items to sell. Everyone starts small. Have a few things on your table. Do some sketch commissions. Make friends with your neighbors. Go to panels. Have fun. That's the best way to start! "", 'This is pretty inspiring, for someone who wants to table next year. ', ""Here's some of my thoughts on tabling, having done conventions as a craft artist and a print/comic artist for about 4 years now:\nFirst of all, consider starting at smaller conventions and art shows. There are often local events where you can get a table for under $50, and you won't have to account for all the extra costs like travel and hotel. That right there will take a lot of stress out of your first tabling experience! \nAlso, you probably won't make a lot of money at your first con. If you can break even, awesome! But you might not, hence why it's good to start small. If you do make profit, huzzah! You can put that toward your next show.\nThere's a lot of variables at a con that you can't control, so focus on what you can: Your product, your presentation, and your salesmanship. Ideally you want to have your stuff in the ballpark of other AA artists in terms of quality, and a presentation that stands out to passerbys (so ideally a vertical display people can see from afar-- avoiding flat table syndrome.) But I think the biggest component of this is gonna be you.\nI've seen people with fantastic artwork but crappy sales because they kept their head down all weekend and didn't engage with people (I've even seen artists sleep under their tables @_@;). Even if your artwork doesn't measure up to others, even if you couldn't afford a nice display... if you're friendly and engaging, and you greet everyone who approaches your table, you'll do all right. At the very least, people will remember you for talking to them.\nAnd unique to comic artists: Develop a compelling pitch! If you're selling comics, people are going to ask you what your comic is about. You need to be able to tell them in like... 10 seconds tops. Develop a logline/elevator pitch, and save the more detailed one for if they seem interested and want to know more. Many times, I've asked a person what their comic is about, and they launch into a long complex retelling of the plot... and I'm totally lost.I have pretty bad anxiety, so I hate getting this question--- which is why I developed a short go-to pitch for when people ask what my comic's about. That way I can use it somewhat reflexively instead of letting my brain go into panic mode, resulting in the aforementioned rambling plot retelling. That said, this is probably the hardest part about selling a comic to someone who isn't familiar with your work, but if you can nail it down, you're gonna have a much easier time."", 'Ok so this is super helpful as I want to get a table at a con super bad ~~Its like my dream  ---I do have a question about what to bring for your table though regarding baskets, shelves, tablecloths and other things what do you bring to spruce up your table ?', ""I always bring a black table cloth (actually its a twin bed size black sheet, because it was cheaper than a real table cloth). I have a magazine rack that holds my comics and sketch covers. Then I have a photographers banner stand that holds all my prints up behind me. It was very expensive to buy, but its made of aluminum so its light weight and easy to carry. I've seen many artists to the same thing with PVC pipe and just spray paint it black. It's heavy and you have to rebuild everything for every con, but its really really inexpensive. (I did PVC for many cons for this reason) I also sometimes use black cardboard and pin/tape charms, pins, keychains, stickers and other junk I've sold over the years, and stand it up using a little table easel thing (Dollar General sells them, $1/ea, or Michaels also sells them for $4/ea or so). \nI have a black photo box I use to put mini prints out that folks can finger through (the thought is if they touch it they will want to buy it). I have a big 11x17 portfolio I also put out on the table that has prints and originals in it that people can flip through while they stand at my table.  \nHere is a great collection of pictures and ideas of other people's tables:\n\n\n      www.pinterest.com\n    4\n\n\n\nArtist Alley Tables and Display Ideas\nFind and save recipes, parenting hacks, style inspiration and other ideas to try.\n\n\n\n"", ""Almost 2 decades ago I had just started my creator owned comic...I only had one book, and me and a couple of friends got together and got a table at a con- that's how soon I ran out and did a con.\n2 years ago, I decided to pick up the pencil again and start back making comics. I gave myself at least a couple of years to get my stuff done before I want to a con; my first con was in February...since then I've done at least 2 more shows. It really depends on how you feel- if you feel you're ready to do it, then give it a shot. The worst that could happen is that you lose money in print costs & table fees; you could end up selling a lot and meet some awesome people.\nI just go, try to have fun, sell books/prints, & meet people.\n@scullpanda I have a tablecloth that fits most 6 ft tables, a banner with my studio logo & main feature comic on it. Just recently for MomoCon I bought some plastic/acrylic magazine stands that I could put my books in, and I have a portfolio book that I showcase my prints that I sell. Technically, you dont have to have the stands; I started out spacing my comics on the table itself. I got my banner done through Vistaprint- they had a sale on printing banners, but if you're starting out you can go to a print store(like Staples or Fedex office) and see if you can get an oversized print on paper to use as a banner(beforehand you wanna look at the con's table policies in regards to banners). Also post your prices, and invest in a cell phone card reader(DEF will need one! You can get one through Paypal; minimum cost- $15). Oh yeah- BUSINESS CARDS with your contact info(website address and/or an e-mail address).\nI just keep my setup simple- this is a pic of my setup at MomoCon...\n"", ""I can pretty much second what @AnnaLandin and @Michelle has already told you, those are some ace advice!\nStart off with a cheap table, or share it with a buddy. If it's your first con, it's awesome with a table buddy, you can help each other when the other needs to go to the bathroom etc =)\nPractise on your sale pitch. I'm still practising and adding/subtracting to my own pitch. It's okay to be nervous and don't get it right at first, there are more chances to make that perfect pitch <3\nBring a table cloth that makes your stuff stand out. Black/white is always a good and safe choice though, and usually better than just the table. I have a turquoise table cloth for my books that are pink =)\nThis is a matter of personal taste, and if you can't that's fine, but I find it's easier to start talking to customers if I stand up rather than sit down (I'm kind of short, so it's easier to get in some kind of eye level if I stand up). You can always alternate between standing and sitting too.\nBring water and some snacks. Water is awesome.\nAs people has said, if it's your first con and you're not well-known, you might not sell awesomely, but eventually people will recognize you if you go to more cons =) \nAnd something I had to learn last weekend, it's okay to be disappointed! I went for the second time to a convention and I did a lot worse than last year - I barely covered my table, which felt really really crappy and I was really down and started comparing myself to people that sold better etc. I felt horrible for feeling like that, but it's ok! As long as I come back, turn it around and try to get better, it's okay to feel a little crappy! =)"", '@jennula It\'s cool. I havent done ""ooh, ahh"" jaw-dropping numbers; for the most I\'ve made my table fees back and then maybe some of the print fees, but it does let me know that there are people out there who like and want my book and art.\nAside from my books I\'m still trying to learn what sells, and how to better prepare myself mentally for each con. I just try to stay positive & keep an open mind going into each show. I kinda felt bummed that I didnt do bigger numbers than I did at MomoCon(it was almost 30,000 people), but I had to take into account that this was my 1st year there and most of the people werent familiar with me or my work. So if the table fees stay the same, I may sign up to do MomoCon next year( I REALLY had a great time there!). I guess I could open things up a bit and take on commissions as well...', '\n\njennula:\nAnd something I had to learn last weekend, it\'s okay to be disappointed! I went for the second time to a convention and I did a lot worse than last year - I barely covered my table, which felt really really crappy and I was really down and started comparing myself to people that sold better etc.\nThis is really important to keep in mind too. When asking the general ""How were sales?"", one person\'s ""great!"" is another person\'s ""meh"" and vice versa.When I table as my fashion accessory shop, my partner and I make more profit than we do when we\'re just selling comics and original prints, so the idea of ""good sales"" can fluctuate depending on the kind of stuff you\'re offering and how your price it. Unless you were to break down and seriously analyze other people\'s sales, comparing your sales to theirs isn\'t an accurate measure.', 'Im tabling with my mom who is a print maker and bookbinder she also makes ornate boxes and paper']",9/11/2016 0:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So what is it about? Quick reminder. You might know Topwebcomic23 which displays a banner from your comic in a huge list. By getting votes every day you reach a higher rank and potentially get more exposure.
What I'm suggesting here is to build up a Tapastic solidarity and exchange votes on a daily basis for the whole month.
I would start a new topic every month, to keep it fresh and members active.So we're back for this new round.
Just post your Twc link below and vote for the whole list everyday this month!

BANNER_Support.png1880x720 1.65 MB
 Hey everyone!
So as some of you know, I was super sick these past two weeks... Fever dreams, body aches, mild vomi- you know what, I'll spare you the details. I posted this a while back thinking I'd be better last week. But today was my first day back at Tapastic HQ and I'm feeling a lot better (still phlegm-y but I've got a spit bucket so never fear!). 
So here's the plan:
CREATOR LIVESTREAM this FRIDAY (6/12) from 4:00 to 5:00 PM PDT. 
I have a handful of topics to cover this Friday including some updates to the Creator Guide to Tapastic, Ad Revenue updates (important ground rules), and a quick preview of some things we're working on. 
Here's what I need from you: 
QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS! 
I noticed that we had a little difficulty getting questions from the chat because @feyuca's drawings were too beautiful! So yeah, leave a question in this thread and we'll answer it and give you a quick shout out. I just want to make sure we (the staff) are able to think of some really good answers and also make sure there isn't any awkward silences 
Thanks!

498,Farewell to Bleach,Events | Challenges,[],"Most people on this website that read shonen jump manga or watch anime would know that today one of the big three of the shonen jump industry which is bleach comes to an end today, just last year Naruto came to an end and to say the truth it didn't touch me that much, I felt rather relieved at the thought that I can finally only focus on my favorite manga Bleach and today the main story finally comes to an end, I remember always thinking bout how I started watching Bleach when I was in my 4th year of highschool, at that time the only thing that mattered to me was being a bully and getting into trouble with my boys, those days were really rough and I enjoyed it but at a time I started getting bored seeing as the only shows I was interested in at that point was Naruto, shows on national geographic wild and action movies and there wasn't much to do at school since I had good grades and didn't have to try too hard to get a B or an A in my major subjects like Biology, Maths n English so at that time I smuggled my phone to school since I was a boarder and as I was browsing through Naruto amvs I saw an anime there with art that just immediately dragged me into it with its beauty and as I checked its name I saw that it was called bleach, I remember laughing really hard and thinking it was some kinda joke till I finally saw their logo and thought to myself that the author really does what he wants in the show and watching it would feel more interesting since Naruto seems to never do things that I would never expect(they usually do the anime clichés like good guys should never lose) and I wasn't disappointed as I watch bleach since the first fight I watched was the main character Ichigo fighting Grimmjow an espada but at that time I used to call them demons since I wasn't totally into the series by then and in that fight I had never seen a main character get his butt whooped so hard, I mean the bad guy gave him a good 5minutes of relentless soccer punches to the teeth before ichigo could even touch the ground and finally I felt like I had found my number one show.Before I knew it I got back to my childhood hobby which was drawing( i stopped drawing around my 3rd year of highschool cuz people said it was childish n all) and I also started to have better relationships with other people, the rate I was bullied by my seniors reduced and the rate at which I bullied others also reduced and it came at a good time because that's when my friends tried to introduce me to drugs and since that time I wasn't bored anymore and had something to do, I ended up staying clean from drugs throughout my highschool and till today. And bleach seems to have a way to get you to interact healthily with people(bad people especially) because till today even though I didn't follow through with all the peer pressure during highschool, I can still interact easily with my friends and total strangers I don't even know where they came from.So since today such a life changing series is about to end, I just wanna say thank you to Kubo Tite  for the several years of entertainment and morals I gained during my time watching the show, also people shouldn't get me wrong, I'm not one of those anime freaks or nerds as they call them, I have a life that I live and anime, manga and comics are the part that I use to show off my creativity whenever academics and logic seems to be getting dull.","['It would be pretty coolIf you put better spacing between your words', ""Good God, Morty, it's a wall of text!!\nWhat I think of all those mangas ending\n\nNow Fairy Tail and One Piece\n"", ""YAY! Bleach is gone!\nSPOILERS\nSorry, but I liked Bleach up until the point where Ichigo lost his powers.  It really should have ended there, and that's where I basically dropped it.  From that point on, the plot kept getting dumber and dumber, and I can't believe the things that my good friend kept telling me that kept happening as the series went on.  I did check back on it once to see how dumb it got, and my god...I just had to stop reading.  My brain cells couldn't take the assault.  It really felt like the creator was just extending the story just for the sake of it to make more money.  With Naruto, as long as it got, I could at least tell that it was leading up to a definitive ending, but with Bleach, I never felt like there was a concrete end goal in sight to strive for.  \nThe end of the arc I mentioned would have been perfect.  Ichigo saves his friends, but loses his shinigami powers, says goodbye to Rukia who started this whole chain of events, and goes to live on his life as a normal human, and all is well.  It would have been such a nice, simple ending.  There's no way I'm slogging through the rest of it though to see what kind of ending is in store.  Didn't I hear that the ending was even cut short from what he originally wanted to do too?\n@mrjonzap I actually heard that One Piece is only 65% through it's story.  And I couldn't stand Fairy Tail.  Naruto, One Piece, and to that arc of Bleach that I mentioned, I could tolerate...but Fairy Tail...UGH..."", ""Geeze, talk about raining on a parade guys. :'D On a friendlier note, I totally get ya. I lost interest in Bleach years ago but back in middle school it was one of the big ones for me. Naruto was sorta what got me into finally watching subs online (because I couldn't wait for the new episodes on  Toonami anymore), but Bleach is what got me hooked on anime. It was past due to end in my opinion, but it's still sort of bitter sweet to see another one of the big ones to come to an end. It's kind of closing a chapter on a lot of people's childhoods."", ""I always liked his art style but I'm not gonna lie, his characters personalities and motivations are vague at best and super bland at worst.  It did go on for a stretch too long.  The earliest arcs were definitely the best.  I feel like a lot of early characters from then were totally forgotten then suddenly brought back to the forefront in that last chapter.  \nWhatever happened to Kon?  Kubo was like:\n\nI think Kubo should stick to either character design work or try to improve his writing."", ""@Greg_Dickson yeah Shonen Jump made him end the series early for some reason. I wanted to like Bleach because I think the characters designs are REALLY cool!! BUT the story, holy fuck the story! I got so bored with it, it's the perfect Mary Sue story, no one can be stronger than MC because MC is MC and MC is important. There were strong characters but Strawberry was always 1% stronger, which made him the strongest, so BORING! I honestly could not stand it.\nFairy Tail is just too... idiotic?? Fucking annoying characters and the power of friendship, fuck outta here with that shit! I get it that it's geared for younger audiences, but come on!"", ""@Riko oh don't get me wrong, I was very much into Bleach when it started.  It didn't get me hooked on anime, but I was hooked on it.  But it depends on the quality of the overall product that makes me feel bittersweet.  I felt bittersweet about Naruto because I thought it was consistently better until the end, aside from a few minor quibbles I had with it.  But I'm totally aware that some people thought it dropped in quality until it's end and ended up hating it, and I'm fine with that.  But Bleach's quality made me drop the series twice.  I respect early Bleach, kind of like how people respect the early seasons of The Simpsons.  But for a lot of people, if they were told The Simpsons was ending, they would cheer to the heavens.  While that show does hold a special place in many people's hearts, many people will say it dipped in quality severely and just kept going and going (and you can tell the creators are just in it for the money by that point).  That's just how I feel about Bleach.\n@mrjonzap The fact that no one could be stronger than Ichigo, always makes me think about that episode of South Park (Good Times With Weapons), where Cartman says that his superpower is having all of the superpowers he wants.  It's extremely lame to have a character like that.  And Fairy Tail's characters always won their battles because of friendship!  It drove me nuts and I just had to stahp!"", '@Greg_Dickson haha that was a good episode because that is such a Cartman thing to do! But yeah, OP MCs are just cancer to a story, they don\'t let anyone else grow up and develop. Should\'ve been called ""Strawberry Does the Thing"" instead of Bleach', ""So does this mean the those Kubo memes are going to end? Anyway, I've always found it interesting that Bleach is considered the top three shounen manga, outside of Japan. In Japan, it's been a mediocre manga much of the time.\nI've always felt Bleach wasted it's side characters only because Kubo kept adding new characters whenever he written himself in a corner. I guess Kubo is going to take a break for a while, I think he really needs it."", ""It's about time that manga ended!\nI'm sorry but in my opinion, the series was complete trash that should have ended loooong ago."", ""I never got into BleachMaybe I'll start that soon\nHaven't heard anything particularly good about the series\nBut if it's anything like NarutoThen it'll lose it's charm over time"", ""If you read the last arc of bleach the big bad was a villain that I thought would end up actually winning, his power is to transform the future and can even rewrite his future death as long as he considers the future he sees as a possibility and Ichigo couldn't take him on at all, not even Aizen could take him."", 'Another long running shonen comes to an end. It\'s always weird to see some series that have lasted such a long time and been around since you were a kid go (even if I didn\'t read them) At the same time I really glad that shonen series GET an ending, and don\'t turn into what North American comics turn their super hero franchises into ><\nI unfortunately wasn\'t a big fan of Bleach (Hunter x Hunter and One Piece are more my thing), I just couldn\'t get into it and there were just a lot of things that annoyed me about it that made it just not fun for me to read. I\'m very story orientated, so the poor story directions, predictability, lack of interested in characters and characters roles being short lived and forgotten was very noticeable for me. As a result I have not bothered to read the series for years.\nBUT it was actually still kind of fun to see how everything rounded out in the end (a friend of mine was showing me clips from the manga and such of how it ended) Though the \'Time skip lets see everyone\'s kids"" endings are getting really old for me.', 'All because of shounen jump rushed bleach to an imperfect end. While they are doing that they are going to drag out one piece since its their big hitter.', 'I am guessing that somehow Strawberry and friends found an impossible way to fool him and kill him even though he was the most powerful being in existence (practically), and then Strawberry did some bullshit again, even though he\'s ""not the most powerful"" (yeah right), and killed him when the most powerful of the soul reapers couldn\'t defeat him. MMMh, yeah, OKAY!\nAnd the prize for poor writing goes to!... Kubo Tite!\nSeriously, you can\'t write a character like that and then just kill him ?????? Doesn\'t he KNOW how he\'s going to die and then change the result? Like, how stupid? I ain\'t even sorry, I just can\'t stand the story, it\'s so stupid. Awesome character design, horrible plot.', ""Bleach was part of my weekly manga routine. Kubo is an amazing artist, but as many have pointed out, dude didn't really know how to write stories. Not consistently any way. The Soul Society arc was masterful, the Pendulum Swings back stories for the Vaizard was also pretty cool. Aside from that it Bleach was a pretty dull series with some serious pacing issues. \nI stuck with it sort of by habit and I can't say I'm especially blown away by the ending. It seemed like a DBZ/Naruto cut and paste. Everyone had the sex and the babies and the circle of life and so forth.\nStill, even with all its flaws. Bleach has a special place in my heart. I'd say that the first part of that series still made it all worth it. ^_^"", '\n\nGreg_Dickson:\n@mrjonzap I actually heard that One Piece is only 65% through it\'s story.  And I couldn\'t stand Fairy Tail.  Naruto, One Piece, and to that arc of Bleach that I mentioned, I could tolerate...but Fairy Tail...UGH...\nOne Piece is still one of my fav comics/manga ever. Oda is a bloody legend! I can\'t believe the series is able to maintain such a level of quality and charm for such a long period of time. And the imagination on that guy! And his art continues to improve over the years. I\'d urge anyone to just stop and look at the detail of his characters and environments. Not to mention his action panels! \nErm, I kinda geeked out there. I really meant to join the bandwagon of ""I can\'t stand Fairy Tail"". The art in it is good, but derivative. Script and character motivations (as far as I\'ve read) are basically non-existent. I stuck with it far longer than I should\'ve... ', ""I actually really like One Piece too.

499,Your OC modelled in clay! Shades Of Men 4 Year Anniversary,Events | Challenges,[]," 
It's been 4 years since I posted the very first Shades Of Men page. I started on my own website at first but added all to Tapastic in 2015.

500,"Homecoming, Thank you Tapastic",Events | Challenges,[],"The Tapastic Staff are wonderful people and aspiring entrepreneurs. Enough said.
But, I'd like to thank Tapastic personally for the postitive impact they have had upon my life. Junior High was not an easy time for me. I wasn't sure what I was going to do in a new school or how I was going to get there. 
Initially I discovered Tapastic when I was reading Strays by Samantha Whitten, a comic I saw my mom reading one day. On the main site, there was a link which said ""Published on Tapastic"" being a link follower, I jumped at the opportunity and clicked the link. Now at the time (according to the Terms of Service) I was not old enough ro make an account on Tapastic, but that didn't stop me from finding some awesome comics on the front page. Back then there were what I call Tapastics Classics. Pary Shah's Unstoppable1, KJ Tower's A, Wave's ERA, Hayel/Chocodevil's Holy Alice1, and nerepi's The Reaper and the Girl1. +more, probably.
There were a few others but they went on Tapastics old Premium program and since they I havent been able to find them. One was called Salty Rain, I believe.
Back then I believe TAPASTICS front page to have essentially the best reads from Tapastic all the time. Over the years it has shifted and to be honest, it's not easy to say if it has been a good shift or a bad. I only prefer the past, that doesn't make it worse though.
The front page and all the beautiful comics were what kept me alive and happy throughout most of my rather contained Grade Seven. In all seriousness, there were hardly and days when the comic I wanted to read failed to upload. Back then the support program also helped keep my favorite authors publishing.
*** What I would like to give to Tapastic is a comic like the ones I read years ago. Ones that never failed to update and always had promising art and coherent storylines. ***
In addition, anyone who has been a long time Tapastic user, I would you to share your stories with Tapastic and let them know what an Amazing site they have created.",[],0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

504,SUMMER OF TAPAS! (Beach Episode Prompt!),Events | Challenges,[],"Surf's up, Tapas Artists!
Honestly, I feel like things have kind of slowed down around here, what with everyone on holidays, and everybody scrambling around with Pokemon Go through the last couple of weeks. If you're like me, (too broke to go anywhere and having substandard phone) you're probably reaching a bit for entertainment.
So here's what I came up with: The fine artists of Tapas are gonna star in their own collaborative art piece, analogous to a beach episode!
The idea is to make a portrait of all participating tapas artists hanging out, and having fun at a beach somewhere. It should inspire a sense of carefree, fun-lovingness, and a fellowship of all of us who make the community here what it is. So bust out some swimsuit designs, because it's gonna be a Summer of water-fights, shack-foods, and maybe some accidental hand-touching, woo!
I have a template provided below, featuring a very quick portrait of myself: 
Those who would wish to join would simply take the image into their preferred artist program, and add themselves in whatever kind of fashion they'd wish, so long as you don't start gratuitously overlap people that they can't be recognizable. (Also, don't forget to export it as a transparent .png or .psd file)
If you wish to work off-template, that's good as well!
Just be sure to put a copy of the picture here, or provide a link to it! If this generates enough interest, we'll start up a hashtag on twitter, so we can pass it around and spread the joy!","[""Protip because we used to do these all the time: it's a lot easier to just ask for the characters and organize them yourself into the collab piece, because it'll save from people accidentally missing other posts or losing the source file or whatever. So all the artists would be responsible for providing their character(s) and you (or a specific individual you choose) would put them all into the final piece. That's just my two cents from someone who's done these a million times lol  It's always easier to do it with one person compiling it than 10+ different people."", ""I wanna participate! But I don't wanna be the only one haha XP"", 'so i just make a portrait of myself, and you stick it into your image?', ""Good tip! Duly noted.\nOf course, this is predicated on the assumption we're all going to be using the exact same template. There's probably other people who might feel motivated to make one or two up of their own for their closer friends, or as an open invitational. Honestly, I'd be thrilled if people took this and went crazy with it.\nMaybe there should be a guideline for people who want to circulate an open template? So they can moderate submissions?"", ""That's pretty much the idea. Think of it like everybody coming in for a photo, or a candid picture of everyone together.

506,Tapastic Cosplay Art Trade Sign Up,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone! Jonny Aleksey1 (creator of The J-Man Web Series1 & The Valve Web Series) here. About a year ago I started doing small annual art event trades on the forums. We've tackled love, monsters, and even the infinite. Now it's time to tackle the most dangerous of challenges...........COSPLAY!
First, please have a look through my previous trade galleries to get an idea of how these are like and to give some love to the people who participated.
Alternate Universe 20153Monster Mash 20156Valentine's Day Secret Admire 20169
Now, on to this one.
This trade will be similar to my Valentine's one. Everyone who pulls in will be given another's name/character randomly to make an image from. This time, however, you will be taking your character and having them wear a costume of the character you get. Or in essence, your character will cosplay as their's.
 
To sign up, all you have to do is post below your:

Name
Comic and Character Name (with link)
Reference pic of the character you want to use

This is the timeline for the event:

Deadline to sign up: July 7th

Deadline to submit your piece to me: July 28th

Date the Gallery will be up on the forum: July 30th


When making your image please make sure it is a PNG or JPEG and fits Tap's 940px limit. Don't forget to sign it! To submit it to me, you can either send a message to my Tap forum profile5 or email it to my gmail ""jonnyalekseywashere@gmail.com"". I prefer sending it through the Tap forums but if you use email, make sure to name it ""Tap Cosplay - (your name)"". Also, it would really help if you send me a private message on my Tap profile1 letting me know you have sent it to me, as I check on my main Tap more then the forums. 
Have a great day and good luck on your awesome!

Thank you for your kind words ;w;<3 Love the expression on Zack's face ^^  "", ""Your art is really good especially with your proportions and body structure, it reminds me on anime but on the other hand the ice that is around his face seems like it is encroaching into his eye since you didn't shade below the eye unless your main character is ice itself and not an ice manipulator but leaving that behind I'm really stunned by the artHere's mine from my comic THE LAST SAMURAI2, he is the main character, his name is Zack Wandaz "", 'I really like the pose and how much movement there is in the picture. Also I like how you put a new speech bubbel for every new word. It really makes me read it in an other way. More exhausted and seriously. Interesting way of doing it. Maybe something I´ll try myself. I like that it is traditional art and that it is made in pencil. Maybe more background would have been nice but it is still a wonderful picture that makes me curious about your story. I will check it out : ) \nHere is the first page of my comic Magic Adviso1r with my main character Lizzy Vinter ^_^\n ', ""Your work has a unique style to it although it feels like shading/lighting/environment needs a lot of work. I think if there was some depth to the backgrounds they would stand out. They all fall flat. The second panel sorta works because there is a sense of perspective. Maybe look up shading/lighting techniques for backgrounds and how to incorporate it into a flatter minimalist approach where it may work. \nI'm uploading new concept art for a comic that's in the works. My current comics i'm uploading are old. It's very mixed media. "", ""In both the images you've provided there's a strong sense of tone from your excellent choice of lighting, color usage and staging. Am I right in guessing that the backgrounds are 3D generated? You've done well to make the spaces real and detailed without going overboard on information. I'd also say that what I think is the 2D element of the fox in the first image is sitting in the 3D image fairly harmoniously. Great use of bringing light in to blend the two mediums together. Without providing a single word I can already see that there's a story here. If I had any criticism, it would be that the body of the fox could be pushed in either two directions: a. More towards a real fox or b. more anthropomorphized. At the moment, the arms and hips need a bit more form, although it's slight, really. Love the compositions and am intrigued by the second image. It reminds me of something from a Lucasarts game...like it could of been a set for Grim Fandango. Very cool. Can't wait to see more.\nHere's the most recent page from my webcomic Gateway City2:\n  "", 'Edit : sorry, didn\'t see the rule thoroughly before o_OFor @russell_m_ols: i think your art is very great! I love how you do the background, the shading and your anatomy pretty good!But the lady in the bottom (with white hair), her head slightly look a little bit strange, maybe because her hair look more fuller to left.But you\'re really greatt! I hope i can shade my art like you didSorry for my bad english :""))\nPleasee judge my art >_<Recently i feel depressed because i can not draw anatomy. My anatomy drawings are so stiff. Any advice perhaps? :"")This is a meme of my webcomic Kyun and Hana >v<  \nAnd this is an upcoming page of  Kyun and Hana  ', ""I guess I'll judge the last two since one seems to have been skipped. \n@russell_m_ols your page is simply stunning! It's full of atmosphere and the lighting and colours are great. If I had to find a flaw, which it is hard to do, I would say that the purple patch at the bottom of the stairs in panel 2 doesn't quite gel with the rest of the tones. That's being super picky though. \n@melindasavenia I think that your anatomy is pretty good! If only I could draw so well! The First Pic in particular looks full of movement and activity which creates a fun atmosphere and makes me want to get to know the characters. You are right though that some of the poses do look a little bit stiff. The sleeping girl particularly. Its something to do with her shoulders, maybe if she was lying totally flat with her head turned to the side instead? \nHere is my, somewhat simplistic in comparison, offering: the latest strip from my comic All Fingers and Thumbs. I would love to know what people think. Any ways it can be improved? you might have to click the link to see it clearly as it looks a little pixelated here.\n""]",7/27/2016 13:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,Nineteen feared dead in Japan After Knife Attack,Events | Challenges,[],"Omigosh! We never hear about anything that bad coming out of Japan aside from the 2011 earthquake. I don't think anybody will make that comment, but if anybody does, Number 1, guns I hear are strictly controlled in Japan and Number 2, Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. Compare that to America where every week you hear about yet another mass shooting or gun related death. i.e the recent cop killings here in the States.
EDIT: For better context, the killer knifed 19 physically disabled people which is why the number is so high.
EDIT 2: Thanks to @heterodont for informing me about how gun laws in the land of the rising sun actually work.
EDIT 3: For anybody who feels this is out of place for a Tapastic topic, I posted this not to gain attention, but because 1. its shocking to hear something as disgusting as this and it not taking place somewhere in America for once. and 2. because Asperger's/Autism technically qualifies as a mental disability, it disgusts me all the more that somebody would have that big a chip on their shoulder towards people who didn't ask to be physically or mentally disabled. 
News article link12","[""19 people dead from a KNIFE ATTACK!?That's one skilled killer xD\nBut in all seriousness, if this was a terrorist attack, this would be the third one this week O_O"", ""\n\nshatterjure:\n19 people dead from a KNIFE ATTACK!?That's one skilled killer xD\nIt was a home for disabled people. It's not like they could get up and run.Worst case scenario, hence the high number of deaths."", ""Oh, i didn't read that part. (i ussualy just read the title)Welp sounds horrid I_I"", 'This is news is so terrible and the fact that the killer said he wanted ""to get rid of the disabled"" makes it worst.', ""My thoughts and heart go out to the victims and their families. Let's be sure to keep the comments respectful of the situation."", ""Guns are actually extremely difficult to get in Japan, you're only allowed to use one type of gun and you're only allowed to use them for hunting for sport.  Rigorous tests as well as passing a written test that only happens once every month - and once you get the license, you have to store the bullets separately from the gun itself as well as give the police detailed information of where the bullets and gun are stored.\nBesides that, this is really heartbreaking :(! It's sad to hear that people still think people who are disabled can't live lives like the rest of the population and either think that they're either lesser than everyone else or that they're suffering."", 'They stabbed 19 disabled people?! What the Hell!', ""everyday a little bit of my soul dies, humans have never been nice to one another but lately it just seems the whole planet is going crazy. it's bad enough to end up disabled and have to live with those struggles and added problems, but then to be killed this way , it's beyond comprehension"", ""Yeah, I don't know what's going on but these days seems like a miracle when we have two days without horrible news. May them rest in peace."", 'Yes, the keywords here are ""seem"" and ""news"".\nNowadays due to the increase of media reportage, the near immediate updates on crimes, everything seems so much nearer and more intense. This in turn makes it easy to fear that the next terrorism attack is at one\'s doorstep and that the world is ready for the apocalypse. Apparently for example in Europe the total amount of terrorism deaths even got lower over the last twenty years, even if we hear about atrocious attacks every day now: http://www.watson.ch/imgdb/0c5f/Qx,A,0,0,610,475,254,197,101,79/87928435704069951\nThis doesn\'t make the crimes any less awful of course but it is important to remember that life goes on. It\'s best to stay strong and not let fear rule.So please everyone, don\'t let parts of your souls die, but rather be the rock that holds against the deeds of lost ones.I think we can get there eventually even if that\'s naive.', 'Truly horrible news 🙁', ""...Ok but why did I need to know about this? Horrific things are happening 24/7. Anyone wanna report on some good news maybe? Something informative? I saw a tumblr post compiling a ton of news from 2016 that were good. Advancements in medicine, good deeds and so on. I should find that post later. \nPoint is, humans latch onto negatives because self-preservation instincts/caution and the media uses that. Most of the time it's all about shocking people. The world isn't getting any worse - we get information way faster and from way more places and in way bigger quantities.\nI don't mean to come across as insensitive... But I'm just confused by why this topic exists."", ""It's not like there are more murders, there's just more media. I think it's also important to note that the facility he attacked was his former place of work, suggesting had likely been set off by something in the workplace (This is not to say he wasn't under any influence or in a healthy state). Certainly guns make it much easier for this type of attacker to commit this sort of crime, however I do not think Japan's crime rate reflects the amount of people who would commit mass murders if they had the means. That number is likely close worldwide. Comparing Japan's low crime rate to Americas high mass murder rate is the exact type of wording that insinuates panic. This is for the same reason that you can't just lump terrorist attackers with murderers, serial killers, and spree-killers. These are extremely different types of crimes (which are collectively at an all-time low). While in Japan there may be very low homicide and theft rates, suicide and sexual assault rates are at an all time high -- it would not be accurate to then compare that rating to America's in order to imply that one country is safer than another. So I don't know what else there is to draw from this comparison."", 'Some people are deeply affected by what\'s going on, and I don\'t see anything wrong with wanting to talk about it with fellow creators. \nIt\'s one thing to remind people that the world isn\'t getting worse, that there\'s plenty of positive things happening. But let\'s not make people feel bad for talking about what they want to talk about. It\'s not like we have a rule saying ""don\'t talk about tragic news reports."" \nI mean, I\'d be bothered if people were just using the forums as a news dumping ground (that kinda seems like... taking advantage of real life tragedies to get attention or something?), but I don\'t think that\'s the case here.', 'Yeah, I understand that. Really, I do! Same as I can understand broaching a heavy topic to a stranger (what was it... was it just called the stranger effect? the bus effect?). But at the same time I can\'t help but think ""why"". Can\'t put my finger on what is so... puzzling. I guess in my mind, It would make more sense to talk about news that have affected you with your friends. Or, like, if the event brought some specific thoughts for the op to discuss and build on that would be particular to a forum for comic creators and readers... I kind of expected the topic to then go on to be about how we portray tragic events and mass-murder in our stories, for example. I guess the topic just felt really out of place to me <\'D', ""There have been plenty of other non-comic topics, so why not this one? \nThen there's the fact that some people don't see this community as a place full of strangers. They may feel it offers them just the right balance of camaraderie and distance to feel comfortable talking about this type of stuff. \n\n\n\nzetina:\nI kind of expected the topic to then go on to be about how we portray tragic events and mass-murder in our stories, for example.\nThat honestly might have bothered me, because it kinda feels like taking advantage of a tragedy to get attention XD; (unless it was specifically about how to portray such events without seeming insensitive?)"", 'My heart goes to the victims and their families.', ""@Savannah My thoughts exactly. \n @aronthemason Agreed. The world is shitty enough. People like that guy don't need to add to it.\n@zetina Relax. You didn't offend. I posted this because its rare to hear about a mass killing in a country where crime rates are far, far lower than the United States where at least once a month, the news is all over some lunatic who shot up a public venue be it the Orlando shooter at that LGBT nightclub here recently or even the news of cops being picked off at random all across the country in response to those dirty cops who shot and killed an innocent black man in Louisiana not even bothering to talk to him much less arrest him so he could be brought in for questioning even though again, he wasn't technically doing anything wrong, some homeless guy merely thought he was."", ""This story personally hits home for me. Being that my fiance is disabled, it really struck a chord with me when I first found out about it. I don't really have much else to say about this other than I pray for the families of the victims.""]",7/25/2016 18:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

511,It’s After Hours’s first anniversary (soon)! Um … help?,Events | Challenges,[],"Er, hi there! My comic, Kurumi's After Hours1, will be turning one year old on July 16! Yay! It's not really much, but having seen my series through for that long sure feels like a massive accomplishment for me! I thought I should make it somehow a bit special, and if possible, I can use your help, by drawing guest strips or guest art for us!
I hope to gather some to post on my series by July 16. In return, I'll credit you and link people to your comic (wherever it's hosted). I don't have a really large readership (172 subs at the time of writing) to showcase your work to, but it still would be nice if you'll lend a hand nonetheless. Please?  
If your answer is yes, thanks a million! Here are the details.

For guest comics, my strip has a simple, four-panel, gag-a-day format (you may opt not to emulate the look of the panel frames, or even to follow a four-panel style). As for plot, what plot? The comic's practically all about puns and character skits. Sometimes generic relatable situations. The three main characters are pretty simple and archetypal, and they're here:
 
Kurumi (leftmost) is the protagonist, a relatively normal high school student. Mostly there for the fanservice. Snarky but friendly, especially doting on her two best friends, though she tends to have tsundere moments toward Mashiro for kicks.
Nagi (center) is outwardly prim and proper, but has a hidden murderously obsessive streak toward her ""senpai,"" Kurumi.
Mashiro (rightmost) is Kurumi's hopeless suitor. Loves to tell terrible puns. Often the receiving end of jokes.
Virtually anything goes with the jokes you want to tell using these characters, as long as they're not NSFW (you can have your own characters appear in the comics if you so prefer!). If you're still unsure about the feel of the comic, you may take a look through the link above.
Buuuut if you're too busy to draw a comic but still want to help, you can submit some guest art of any of the characters. Whatever style, whatever format, it's all okay!
So, uh, I know I'm really asking a lot of you, but thank you for dropping by nonetheless. You may PM me or post in this thread until July 16  .Again, so many thanks!

Tapsters vote on Topwebcomic. Crank your rank up! (CLOSED)
Hello people,    I am sure a lot of you guys are on Topwebcomics! I must say I am too. And we would all want to see our banner higher on that list!    Then, Let's help eachother out and vote everyday for a list of fellow Tapastic creators. I assure you this is all legal and only artist solidarity.    How does it work: - Post here the name of your comic and the link to your topwebcomic voting page. - I'll add you to the list below - You would then take a few minutes everyday to vote for all the co...




So what is it about? Quick reminder. You might know Topwebcomic which displays a banner from your comic in a huge list. By getting votes every day you reach a higher rank and potentially get more exposure.
What I'm suggesting here is to build up a Tapastic solidarity and exchange votes on a daily basis for the whole month of June.
I would start a new topic every month, to keep it fresh and members active.
Just post your Twc link below and vote for the whole list everyday in June! I'm sure you'll see your stats fly high in no time!

518,Valentine’s Day Secret Admire 2016 Gallery,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone! Jonny Aleksey (creator of Jonny Web Series & The Valve Web Series) here. So this Valentine's Day I hosted a little art trade here in the forums. I hosted a couple of other events too, which you can find here:
Alternate Universes1
Monster Mash (for Halloween)2
This Valentine's event, though, might be my most successful so far with 20 images made. The idea behind this trade was that everyone participating would get another's character. They would that make an image of their own character giving that character a Valentine's gift (based on the info given by the creator).
So without further a due, here are everyone's pics:
Now, while I think everyone did a fantastic job I think some star points should go to Mar Mai and Legendriders96 for going above and beyond and making min-comics for their secret loves:
Mar Mai's (The Dragon Tutor) epic for Zannen (IMAGICA=verse1). So big I had to crop it into 4 parts (Sorry if there's some stretching going on):  
Legendriders96's (Legend Riders: Legacy of Leneira) lil' ol comic (read right to left) for Riko (City of Blank1): 

Before we go into chronological order from when participates signed up I just want to showcase Joanne Kwan's, William J. Bowles', and Kallehmomo's images because by shear luck they somehow got interconnected with each other. Everything was random mind you, so this was pure coincidence.
Joanne Kwan's (Heavy Horns) gift for Kallehmomo (Life of a Homeschooler):
 
Kallehmomo's (Life of a Homeschooler) gift for William J. Bowles (Outcast Kingdom1):
 
William J. Bowles' (Outcast Kingdom1) gift for Joanne Kwan (Heavy Horns):
 
Now, on to chronological order:
Tanisha's (Model Student1) gift for Calconstantine (Sunweaver):
 
Nika's (Love Debut!) gift for Legendriders96  (Legend Riders: Legacy of Leneira):

Stellamari's (Goldlocks Agency for Superheroes1) gift for Shiorisaku (Star Watcher1) comes with a little message: 
""Dear Mutt,
I hope you will like my favourite star-gazing spot as much as I do. Happy Valentine Day, puppy.
Mina.""
 
ErithEl's (Burning Bright) gift for Jrej (Shades of Men1):
 
S.A.'s (Wingless: The Dovecote Princess1) ""gift"" for Schaefges (A Legend (of some sort)):
 
Deslim's (The Little Things) gift for ErithEl (Burning Bright):
 
Cielle's (Reus) gift for Stellamari (Goldlocks Agency for Superheroes1):
 
Jrej's (Shades of Men1) gift for Team Oops (Oops Comic Adventure1):
 
Riko's (City of Blank1) gift for S.A. (Wingless: The Dovecote Princess1):
 
Team Oops' (Oops Comic Adventure1) gift for Annabel (Polyphemus): 
 
Annabel's (Polyphemus) gift for Tanisha  (Model Student1):
 
Moon Dreamer's (Tsukiko: the moon child's wish) gift for Mar Mai (The Dragon Tutor):
 
Shiorisaku's (Star Watcher1) gift for Cielle (Reus):
 
Schaefges' (A Legend (of some sort)) gift for Nika (Love Debut!):
 
Zannen's (IMAGICA=verse1) gift for Moon Dreamer (Tsukiko: the moon child's wish):
 
Well, that's it for Valentine's Day. Whether your with your significant other, your friends, or your cat, a great way to celebrate the day of love is to read everyone's comics here. They all worked really hard to make these presents and it would be wonderful if you showed the same level of gratitude with your readership. Thank you to all my lovlies that made this the most awesome art trade I've hosted yet.
Speaking of trades, I have lots of ideas for more themed events like this. And whether you've done one of my trades before or would like to start, you can help me pick my next one. Here are your two choices:
Cosplay Event:
To people who have participated in my Monster Mash2 last Halloween, this is similar. Basically, I will have five different media types and which ever you get you would draw your character(s) cosplaying as your favorite franchise from that media form. Here would be the categories:

Live Action Movie/TV
Animated  Movie/TV
Printed Comic
Webcomic
Video Game

Comic Jam Event:
This event is based somewhat on both the Tapastic Winterfest Event and SVA's Cartooning Club. So in this trade everyone would get someone else's character, similar to this event. You would then write/draw a one page/5-6 panel comic with both your's and their characters. It would end on a cliffhanger of sorts. Then, you or I (haven't thought it through yet) would give it to the person you got and they would finish it.
This one might be a little complex, but I though it would be fun to see how people would end comics with their characters that they didn't write themselves.
So write in the comments which event you'd like to see. Keep in mind that because of thesis, webcomics, and conventions; I might not start this event until probably near the end of April or mid-May. This is mostly just for me to see what you guys would rather do. 
Once again, I hope you all have a fantastic Heart Day!","[""Aww these are so cute! Thanks for sharing everyone's art!

522,Alien OC competition,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi guys! I want to host a competition for my series Mercenary Gu https://tapastic.com/episode/3295566 . The competition is simple, choose one of the factions or races I've listed in this thread http://forums.tapastic.com/t/what-alien-races-do-you-want-to-appear-in-my-comics/11438/79 (be sure to scroll all the way down to see all the races) and create your own OC based on it. Show art and give a basic bio of the character(try your best to think creatively based on the information given/or lack their of given info about the race/faction you choose. 
If you win that character you created will have a minor role in the next issue (and a slightly bigger role in a future issue) AS WELL as a cameo of your OC from your series appearing in the background.
There will be two winners, one is chosen by me and another is based on a community vote. 
*Remember the races HAVE TO be either human or on of the alien races I've created (even the alien races I didn't jot info down for is good too) the OC can even be a mixed race if you want. I prefer if you use one of the alien races but human is still ok.Examples of my comic series

1) Creator makes a 10x10 grid. Each box is numbered, from 1 to 100.
2) Every time Creator completes a task relating to their goal (e.g. a comic page), they fill out one box, starting from box #1.
3) Anyone who wishes to support Creator can claim a number. Let's say you claim #10. (Some Creators may wish to keep it between friends though, so ask before claiming!)
4) When Creator has completed 10 tasks and reaches box #10, then you have to give them a gift -- e.g. a sketch of their character. 
This is mine: 
Normally I'm uncomfortable receiving fanart for ANY reason other than ""I love your character,"" but here, I feel okay since I'll be earning it.

However, I wasn't quite satisfied with how I performed back then, so I do another OC-drawing thread to see how much I've improved since last time.

@marfivemai and I are doing something crazy over on Picarto right now!
A Quick Draw Mutli-Livestream Event!

We'll have separate manga studio files open and both of us will be drawing a combination of the all audience's requests as they shout them out in the chatroom (audience participation will be key!). 
For example, the audience members give us poodles, ice cream, and tank. Mar Mai would draw her version of all those elements combined in an image and I'd draw mine. We have about 5 to 10 minutes per quick draw and the audience chooses a winner per round. All for fun though. XD

532,We’re Tabling Tapastic @ SacAnime Gives Back,Events | Challenges,[],"SacAnime will be hosting their first ever charity convention, ""SacAnime Gives Back"" on May 15, with the proceeds supporting WEAVE.  In the spirit of helping others that the convention embodies, Golden Plume Comics will be volunteer hosting a Tapastic approved table in Artist's Alley.  Our goal will be to promote Tapastic as the premier webcomic platform for both readers and creators and help drive new traffic to the app and website.  Additionally, we would like to feature FOUR different creators at the Tapastic table.  Yes, this will be totally free promotion for your webcomic.  Interested?  Read on.
Table Details:
FOUR creators will be featured at our assigned 6' table.  The table theme will be simple and elegant, with mostly blacks and whites.  Two* table fliers will be available for free for attendees to take home. ""Flier One"" will feature the four table creators and is open to any entry that meets the following minimums:
(1) The comic must have a color cover available printable at 8.5"" x 11"".(2) The comic must have at least 10 pages available printable at 8.5"" x 11"".(3) The comic must have at least 30 subscribers.
If your comic meets all of these prerequisites, entry requires only a reply to this thread.  There is no cost to enter.  Closing date to enter is Monday May 2, 11:59 am PST.  ONE ""Best of Show"" chosen by us and THREE ""Random Draw"" creator entries will have their comics available on the Tapastic table in printed form and will be featured on ""Flier One"".  The table printing will consist of your color cover printed on 60# paper and tucked inside the front of a clear face 3-ring binder.  At least 10 but not more than 20 pages will be printed and placed inside each binder in clear protective page sleeves for maximum presentation value.  This will allow convention attendees to browse your comic in person.  By entering you are only granting us limited permission to print and display your comic during the convention.  Afterwards all papers will be shredded and all related files deleted.
 (Image: Tapastic Table “Flier One”, true size 5.5” x 8.5”, 100# glossy)
Our lead writer T.R. Racki will be at the table and will be knowledgeable in each of the featured comics should there be questions asked by attendees. Hopefully all of the featured creators will gain an appreciable number of new subscribers.
Local Tapastic readers and creators are encouraged to come stop by the table and say hi to T.R. He will have a smartphone on hand for lots of picture taking and will Tweet the action throughout the day on @PlumeComics5.  Free Crowned! covers will also be available if you wish to come by and take one home.
Relevant updates to this event and a final written summary of the day will be posted below as they come available.
*(""Flier Two"" is closed entry featuring four Tapastic manga creators.)
Why Do This?:
Some may be thinking, ""Why promote Tapastic?  Why feature someone else?""  Simple.  The beauty of the Tapastic platform is that everyone wins when it grows.  More readers means more subscribers for everyone, more ad revenue for all, more Patreon supporters, etc.  Most comics are a fast read.  When readers finish and have to wait for the next episode, most likely they will go reading another creator's work while they wait.  Win-win!  
Imagine if every creator promoted not just themselves but two other Tapastic comics?  It would be ""pay-it-forward"" on steroids.  We would love to see the development of a group of TVACs (Tapastic Volunteer Ambassador Creators) who table and/or planel at their local conventions.  With just a few hundred TVACs, the worldwide comic convention scene would have a global Tapastic presence and reach millions more potential readers.  Wouldn't that be awesome?! 
Draw on.
Respectfully,Golden Plume Comics

541,All Star Fighters Tapastic! [Sign up thread],Events | Challenges,[],"It's finally here? It's finally here! After all this time All Star Fighters is ready to start accepting sign ups!
Just what is Tapastic All Stars?Basically Tapastic All Stars is a simple battle engine that runs automatically designed to pit characters against one another. People can submit a character from their Tapastic hosted comic to fight (one entry only per person), backgrounds are also required so if you feel inclined then feel free to also submit a background - and yes, you can submit a background without submitting a character, just access sign up and you'll have the option. For more information or to see previously answered questions check out the expressions of interest thread11.
A prototype battle can be seen here31 (a blank screen means its downloading)
How does it work?Each battle (currently no set schedule but tentatively twice a day) a new battle will be posted decided randomly. Each character will start with 2 hearts and a maximum capacity of 3. For every battle won a heart will be stolen from the opponent, with any additional hearts over 3 lost to the void. When a person runs out hearts, thats it, they're out!
What do I need to do to create a character?Basically what I need to know is general information about your character (information will be gathered in the follow up questionnaire sent out to applicants), draw some requested keyframes/profile picture of your character, and you're all set! Everything you need to know will be sent to you so please don't start drawing things to submit in advance.
To sign up just click this link19. Registrations will be accepted up until the end of April. Follow up questionnaires may be sent out before then.
If you have any questions feel free to leave them below or e-mail allstarfigherstapastic@starryday.net","['When will the fighters need to be finished and/or will more be added afterwords?', ""Hey Jacen, I'll be sending out a follow up questionnaire for people signing up  the end of April is just for submissions."", ""Of course I'm in!

545,Wrong universre (RESET),Events | Challenges,[],"Hi there!If you are new in this topic then all you need to know is that the series wrong universe is a comic that envelops around visiting others people comic. 3http://tapastic.com/series/WrongUniverse8RESETSo you might be wondering why the reset in the title? Well, its because the original topic is to old for me to edit and the organization back then was terrible and im here to fix this.... hopefully. I just want to make sure that this project doesnt get stranded just because one of the creators forgot that he was suppose to start it and was impossible to communicate with....STORYMaffi and Dex are two room mates. They have been working on a prototype that will allow them to travel between universes. While they travel around mr.jon (the cat) i will toy around with their home beacon and turn it off. After some time they try to get back home they realise that the beacon has been shut down and are unable to go back .So they travel through random worlds in hope to get back into their own.
IMPORTANT STUFF
1  If you want to be included just comment down below and i will add you to the list. 
2   Characters of visited comic's will be added to series banner once the page will be uploaded.
3 IMPORTANT! Those who had read this before (on my old topic) know that this comic was supposed to be about collaboration and that we were supposed to work together on skype or hangouts. However due to the fact i barely have time for even drawing so i am unable to fulfill what i promised so you will mostly have to work on the page alone. Im not saying that i wont be in contact but i will definitely not have time for drawing the page with you. ALSO make sure to send me the script or scratch of the comic before you draw it. Because from my past experience , i know that i might sometiems want to fix how my characters will say certain things. And we dont want those changes to affect your work greatly so make sure to send it in the early stage of making . This also goes for the storyline as we want to keep that intact and so it would make sense.4 Whats going to happen in your universe is up to you!  Note that each visit will be one page and 20 panels max to not so it wont take forever to visit each comic.
SUPERP IMPORTANCE (not really)I will need all of you who are willing to participate in this to tell me where you want to be in the comic. If you want to be visited in the middle of the series , end or at the very beginning.Btw , i will not be picking comics at random. That was a terrible idea i had  on my previous post.
5 I want to have some kind of update schedule for this like weekly updates or something like that.So for the sake of us both, add me on skype ,steam or hangouts. Because otherwise it might be pain to contact one another and get it done on time. My skype: Frufrarek My steam: FrufrarekMy Google+: maffi.kraciuk@gmail.com
If you have a question just comment down below or send them on maffi.kraciuk@gmail.com and i will answer them.
Here is the list of creators who want to take a part of this!  Please let me know where you want to appear in the series. c:
Begining: @Toad_Sta_OvnMiddle or something@APM@Jrej@rainbowolfe @cylmill
End: no one so far","[""Cool. Nice to see you again Maffi. I'm down for being a part of your crossover comic."", ""I'd love to be a part of this! Could be cool having your characters visit the modern world in Paris1 and meet up my homeless characters.\nAny story arch you want to follow?Event that should happen in specific episodes?I see more potential than just a gag a day strip!"", 'Alright nice, i will make sure to add you to the list. Also,  when do you want to show up in the series? At the begining , middlem or at the end of it?', 'Sweet, I will be making sure to add you to the list! Also, when do you want to show up in the series? \nAnd yeah, this series has some potential thats why i want to keep a good eye on it ', ';DDDDD Me please! Thank you!', 'Alright,  just tell me when you want to appear in the series c:', ""Oh, it's great idea! I would like to participate too! I don't know when appear in your series, in the middle maybe? I have two series, The Sky Travelers is still in the prologue, then I think it isn't the time to do this. I think it'll be better with Team Trouble (has a limited space, but a lot of characters)."", 'I am not sure at what point I should jump in. From you the interaction my characters could have I think it would be kind of a slower pace. Probably in the middle then...\nMaybe we should gather all participants first, decide on an arch to follow and construct the right order from that. I would see your characters collecting items or having side kick characters along the way...', ""I'd love to join the series ((again, haha)). I can join anytime in the middle o3o\nQuestion, if we have multiple series, can we be in it multiple times?"", ""I'm thinking at the beginning so that its done and out of the way."", ""Oh! ehm,since my comic's just starting and the plot's not even quart-way done,I'd love to do it in the middle part of your series if I may,sir! ;>"", ""This is like Quantum Leap, I like it! Though my comic  is recently going through a chapter 1 revamp, I'd be interested! The old chapter is up on here!\nEdit: Guess I can't discretely redact this. Oops, I did not realize I would be drawing the updates by myself. Personally it sounds a bit iffy to me."", ""I would love to join up on the hype train! Elemental is full of strange and different creatures that my characters have never seen before, so it might take a while for them to realize yours don't belong in their world!

550,Peace Campaign 2016 ((LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS/ARTISTS)),Events | Challenges,[],"Hello Everyone! We're We Got Jams!
""We Got Jams?"" Yes, our name is We Got Jams! Because we got a special kind of jam. Peace Jams! Which brings us to our topic now. There are two admins for We Got Jams. We are collaborating to make a comic that promotes peace, love, equality, and anything that spreads a positive message. (Kinda like how you spread jam on bread. The jam being peace and the bread being the world!) So, Peace Jams! 
This comic will be open for anyone to submit their positive message! The people who submit comics will be credited of course.
Admin Noglastiaa came up with the idea because she felt that it needed to be done. Last year was full of such bad and horrible events and 2016 should not be left in such a shadow, but rather a clean slate. She talked with Admin Chibi and they both decided to make this project happen. This is where the comic comes into play! 
How This Will Work
Submit your idea to us! How? Send a private message to any account: We Got Jams Joint Account38Admin Noglastiaa's Account6Admin Chibi's Account9or submit your ideas to our email!peacejamsubmissions@gmail.com
Things to include with your submission:

A description that you wish to include at the bottom of your comic
A link to a song you may want to play with the comic
Your name and a link to your profile (you can ask to be anonymous)

These are optional, so if you don’t want to include any of these, please tell us in the message you send! 
SOME GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW

NSFW; if it is crucial to the story you are trying to tell, it will be accepted. However, we will not accept comics that include nudity, cuss words, or comics that insult, degrade, or purposefully attack any living being. 
If a comic has a more serious theme, it will be tagged as NSFW and will be given a trigger warning banner. Helping each other through hard times by sharing your own stories is welcome. Sometimes people need to know they are not alone and things do get betterFor example, if the comic shows a person who self harmed, but in the end they were able to move on. We accept those themes as long as it has a happy ending/moral.
Different opinions and views are welcome. Hatred is not. Rude comments are not.Not everyone will have the same opinions and we understand that. But that does not mean we have to be mean. Everyone's opinion matters but you should be able to show it in a kind and educated manner!

Keep in mind that all submissions will be reviewed before they are posted on the comic. Be warned that any comics breaking these guidelines will be rejected and the artist may be asked to fix it. (We'd really rather not do that so please follow all the guidelines! :D) 
=========================================
Here are some ideas/examples of what you can include in your comic

A comic about your favorite inspirational quote
A comic that has your favorite uplifting song lyrics
Or maybe even a simple comic just telling others to smile because they are beautiful
The comic can also be specific to a cause such as:: LGBTQ positive, anti-misogyny or family oriented messages.
It could just be something kind and positive that generally appeals to the masses such as being a better person or taking care of the environment.

The bottom line is, the comic is what YOU want to spread to others! So artists are free in choosing what kind of message they want to spread to others! (As long as it follows the guidelines, of course)
*If you do decide to make a comic that uses other people's words (quotes, song lyrics, poetry, etc.) please be sure to include where you got it from in your description. Ex: “The only lasting beauty is the beauty of the heart.” This quote is by Rumi.*
=========================================
EVERYONE (offsite or onsite) is welcome to join in on spreading the message of peace and happiness!If you're interested in participating, please let us know. Also if you've got any ideas or suggestions to make this project a success, we're more than happy to hear them!

551,April Fools Comics on Tapastic,Events | Challenges,[],"HALT:  Before reading forward, go through your reading list FIRST!
waitingDone?  Good.  Chances are, you probably came across one or more creators with an April Fool's comic with a striking resemblance to the lines below:
Person 1:  *Walks through door (Greeting).*Bucket of liquid splashes onto individual that was planted on top of doorPerson 2:   April Fools!Person 1:  That was extremely unoriginal.Person 2:  Maybe...I am the fool.
 
Apparently, there was a plan of multiple creators (many who have popular series) to release the same comic punchline.  On top of that, they're jointly bashing each other in the comments, claiming others have stolen their idea. 
EDIT:  Dorkly writes a piece on it, with details of its link to Reddit.


Jacen:
Dorkly did a page on it, this joke is bigger than just Tapastic... http://www.dorkly.com/post/77685/april-fools-webcomics?ref=homepage
Here's another article from @fishscribbles on the Verge about a Facebook group and dude behind this:http://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/4/1/11345654/why-did-webcomic-artists-all-post-the-same-comic-today-making-fools13
There's a list of all creators participating in this building in the comments of https://tapastic.com/episode/31711716 and I thought I'd relay the list.

553,Wrong universe *updated V.8 STARTING,Events | Challenges,[],"Hi there!If you are new in this topic then all you need to know is that the series wrong universe is a comic that envelops around visiting others people comic. http://tapastic.com/series/Wrong-universe27STORYMaffi and Dex are two room mates. They have been working on a prototype that will allow them to travel between universes. While they travel around mr.jon (the cat) i will toy around with their home beacon and turn it off. After some time they try to get back home they realise that the beacon has been shut down and are unable to go back .So they travel through random worlds in hope to get back into their own.
Regarding Wrong Universe artwork. Anyone who's participating in this can send me an artwork of his/her universe. That is to say, Landscape ,characters and scraped stuff.  Ofc it has to be something that is related to this project. After sending me it and with my approval(which i will most likely approve in 99% cases) I will post it there and put a link in the description to the creators page. Just so people can get more audience for their comic ^^
IMPORTANT STUFF
1  If you want to be included just comment down below and i will add you to the list. 
2   Characters of visited comic's will be added to series banner once the page will be uploaded.
3 IMPORTANT! Those who had read this before know that this comic was supposed to be about collaboration and that we were supposed to work together on skype or hangouts. However due to the fact i barely have time for even drawing so i am unable to fulfill what i promised so you will mostly have to work on the page alone. Im not saying that i wont be in contact but i will definitely not have time for drawing the page with you. 4 Whats going to happen in your universe is up to you! Once this comic will reach your world we might have to tweak it a bit to to have connection to the overall story line of this series. Note that each visit will be one page and 20 panels max to not so it wont take forever to visit each comic.
SUPERP IMPORTANCE (not really)I will need all of you who are willing to participate in this to tell me where you want to be in the comic. If you want to be visited in the middle of the series , end or at the very beginning.Otherwise i will go picking comics to visit that are in the list at random.
If you have a question just comment down below or send them on maffi.kraciuk@gmail.com and i will answer them.
List of people who will be visited in this comic.  (note that this is not the exact order as i have yet to get info where you when you want to be visited)

554,Post the Events you’re attending! Network & Promote,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey guys,I noticed there are a few specific conventions posted on the forums, but I thought it would be cool to include them all in one thread, so Tapastic users all over the world can see any local events near them that others are attending.
So whether you are attending or presenting your work, feel free to post anything from the next big ComicCon trip you're planning, to any smaller local events in your area.
I guess to start things off...I'll be sharing a table with Rob White of Versus and SurrealsVille, presenting my business Ink Lion Arts1 and my comic #Villainous, at WynterCon 03 in Eastbourne, East Sussex, UK, on 1st & 2nd October 2016.

567,Lets Draw: A Drawing Contest!,Events | Challenges,[],"So I have seen a couple of creators do these, but I haven't seen much on the forums, so I said WHY NOT!
Below you will find a picture of a cute little alien, nothing too complex. (also, just to be clear, the giant black think is his/her eye, not mouth. I realized that it might look like a mouth right after i inked it!)
The rules are simple:

All designs should be submitted by Sunday at noon (PST)(can change)
In the spirit of tapastic, lets keep the pictures SFW. Now i don't mean that I'll have some ban hammer or whatever, but keep it reasonable.
You can do anything to the picture, as long as the alien is still apart of the subject. The reason why I say this because I know all of you can create beautiful pictures of you space cat with a tiny alien sitting in the far corner, almost never to be seen. Thats not the point of this. The point of this is so that we can see how we all approach the same project with different out comes, because its fun!

Now done with the talk, heres the picture: (if this is too big, i can resize it, but i think its good)
On sunday, i will look over at all the designs and choose the winner. The prize for the winner gets to name this little guy, for future drawing contests!
If you guys have any ideas or would like to see more of this, just drop a word! I can change the picture any if this is just too little, so your imput would be helpful for me.

570,Valentine’s Day Secret Admirer Art Trade,Events | Challenges,[],"Deadline has past! No more submissions please!
Hello everyone! Jonny Aleksey (creator of Jonny Web Series & The Valve Web Series1) here. Hope you all had a wonderful holiday season this December. If you're unaware I did two art event-type-things this year, and you can check out the galleries for them here:
Alternate Universes5
Monster Mash (for Halloween)2
Now as Valentine's Day approaches, it's time for another. This trade is similar to a Secret Santa, BUT WITH A TWIST! In the spirit of love, all participates will get (in secret) another participate's character. Then, you will draw your own character giving that character a valentine's gift (both should be in the image). Get it, YOUR character is their valentine! The gift can be anything from chocolates to flowers to world conquest. It's up to you. 

Valentine's-Tapastic-Template.png940x1410 227 KB

*Your gift should be something they would like (hence the ""'Likes"" section)
*Though I drew a perfect romance above, that doesn't mean you have to. Your character or their's could react differently depending on their personalities. They could be sad. They could be angry. They could be snobbish. Most likely, they will be sarcastic. I suggest looking through their comics to get a good idea of who the character is and how they'd react. And keep your character in mind too. Maybe they hate giving gifts. They have to, of course. That's the law!
How to Sign Up!:

Link to your Tapastic profile
Link to your comic
Post a reference image of what character you'd like to use (preferably in color)
(Optional) Give a quick blurb of who your character is and what kinds of gifts they'd like.

Deadlines and where to send it:
Sign up deadline: January 22nd 
Expect  to get a private message of who you got sometime between January 23rd and 25th.
When you are done, please email it me at jonnyalekseywashere@gmail.com, or send me a link to it in dropbox at my Tapastic profile.2 If you send by email make sure to title it ""Valentine's Day Secret Admire (your name)""
You will get your pictures on, when else? Valentine's Day! So try to send it to me before February 14th. 
Update: If we end with an odd number of participates, I may need someone to do more then one image. If you're willing to do a second image for someone, please write so in your submission. Whoever is will have a ""Cool for Doubling"" under their list section. Please ignore this, as it's most for me, so I can remember.
Good luck to everyone involved and I'm sure your images will be...................lovely! (sorry)

His personality is a little complicated. He's kind of a smart ass, but he's got a heart of gold.

His favorite color is purple.Traits:He is tallish (in the 5'11"" to 6 ft range) and slender with black/very dark purple hair and golden eyes. Overall, he is not that interested in romance, but he does have a somewhat flirty personality (and boy does he use it to his advantage).

571,Jump Plus x MediBang Manga Contest,Events | Challenges,[],"Just came across this and knew I had to post it here. 
So essentially, Medibang and Jump + are running a Manga Contest open to creators in and outside of Japan. Entrees from outside japan will be translated and submitted as long as they are written in: English, Korean, or Chinese (simplified and traditional).
The entry period is from 12/17/15 to 03/17/2016.
Grand Prize: 1 million yen, publication in Jump + , and feedback from editors.Second Place: 300,000 yen , publication in Jump + , and feedback from editors.Third Place: 100,000 yen, and feedback from editors. 
※The possibility of no winners being chosen exists.※Entries that don't win may also receive feedback from editors.
Note -You do need to have a MediBang account to enter. See website on how cash winnings are handled.
IF YOU WIN AND AGREE TO SHUEISHA'S CONTRACT, THEN SHUEISHA WILL OWN YOUR STORY
For more info - https://medibang.com/jumpplus/99
So, what do you guys think? Anyone else thinking about entering?","['You beat me to announcing this..Though, I might enter.', ""Only saw it about 10 minutes ago, myself \nThe prospect of getting your work examined by a pro really is tempting.\nThat, and the fact that cash prizes like that, even though I don't see myself winning them, will do wonders on the mind of any college student in the US \nBetween this and the manga magazine17, my winter vacation is looking VERY busy right about now..."", ""I saw this contest yesterday. I hope they make more editions after this one. I really wish to participate and all, but I have way too many things to do until March and I won't be able to do anything. \nAnyway, you can also participate in the Silent Manga Audition, I'll leave a link to the official website here: http://www.manga-audition.com/21"", ""Jump is known for having very terrible copyright terms for those who enter the contest, so I'm hesitant to suggest this to friends without giving it a thorough read through."", ""Interesting. I hadn't heard about this before. Come to think of it, I'm having a hard time finding copyright information pertaining to the submissions."", ""a comic finished, undder 50 page, before Thurs Mar 17th 2016\nthat's not easy..."", 'Wow, what do you mean by that? Care to share..?', ""I imagine the terms for actually entering the contest are whatever the default terms for Medibang's site are. They should really have the terms for the winners up as well, though."", 'when they say ""under 50 pages"", how short do you think it can be? Are 15 or 20 pages enough?I don\'t know if I\'ll have time for that but I\'d like to try anyway.', ""If you research about the Japan based version of the contest, they have a lot more detailed information about this.

There's a few other things I think I'll add to the official submissions that have been suggested too. I'm also hoping webcomic artists really take advantage of putting their ad for their comic into the magazine.

Just don\'t get discouraged by any comments you may receive, the community there is a bit weird... I tried tagging one of the comics I had posted there before with the contest tag just to try it out and received one of the most hilarious comments I had ever seen XD Haha, it\'s too hilarious not to share it (hopefully the author will forgive me):\nyour work is not manga. why are you submitting to a contest your work doesn\'t apply to? your artwork is amazing without a doubt but have some respect for manga and submit something that fits SHONEN JUMP.\nWell, now I\'m totally tempted to submit all of my Trivia from Nature comics there just to irk this person  As much of a meek guinea pig as I am, I LOVE teasing people who know best in the world - is there anybody else who can submit their comic that\'s ""not a manga"" in this person\'s view?

574,Creator Dashboard and Support Updates,Events | Challenges,[],"Creators! We've made some updates to the Dashboard to make it easier to find and simpler to navigate. We've also made some improvements to Support Program setup and formatting.
Dashboard
Previously, the Dashboard lived under the Publishing menu (aka the upload cloud icon on the top bar). Now, everything is consolidated under the Account menu, and rather than a separate Publishing menu the upload button is just that – a button to upload new episodes to your series. If you haven't created a series yet, the upload button will take you to more info about publishing on Tapastic.

Dashboard - Tabs.png1229x513 68.3 KB
 
When you visit the Dashboard you may notice some spiffy new tabs along the top. Everything you knew and loved from the old Dashboard is still there (maybe even a couple things you weren't aware of or couldn't find), it's just a lot more organized. We've also made it easier to find various helpful resources, such as the Comic Creator Guide, Support Program Setup and User Guides, and FAQ, located undre the Help tab.
Please note that you may not see all of the tabs right away – you need at least one series with episodes to see Performance, Ads, and Support, and need to have started an Ad or Support Program before the Revenue tab will appear. 
A number of other small improvements are sprinkled throughout, such as updated Tips and the ability to view daily or monthly performance and revenue stats (previously only 7- or 30-day periods were available).
Support Program
Setting up and formatting a Support Program is now easier than before, thanks to the addition of some new sections and improved guidelines accompanying each part. Rather than mashing everything together and copying and pasting sample HTML to organize everything, Supporter Perks and (optional) Community Goals are now distinct sections with their own titles. Milestone Rewards have also been improved, with big bold titles and separate descriptions. Basically, Support pages should look more consistent and be simpler to set up, which in turn should make it easier for potential supporters to understand your goals and rewards.

Creators with an existing Support page should double check to make sure they're happy with how things look, and to take advantage of the new sections. For example, it's a good idea to move Reward titles into the new ""title"" field, rather than formatting them with HTML tags. Likewise, if you have Community Goals you can move them into the appropriate section. It should only take a couple minutes to upgrade your page... and it's a good excuse to spend a little time checking on your supporters and whether any of your Support Program details could use freshening up!

576,NO-Earth Comics’ Warmage needs some cameos,Events | Challenges,[],"  I tried this on another forum too, but got not a nibble there.  
  I have a 4 page Market scene coming up in Warmage.  Rather than just make up random characters for the background, I thought I would give some other comics a shout out by having some cameos.  If you have a fantasy comic, and you would like to see what your character looks like rendered in the style of Warmage, then post a description and artwork in this thread.  Also, feel free to link to defining page for the character, they might give me some ideas for what the character will be doing in the background.

579,Join in on the Tapastic Winter Fest!,Events | Challenges,[],"You and your characters are invited to join in!
Because it wouldn't be a site wide multidimensional Winter Fest hub world without you and your comic! 
So here's the idea,

Draw you or your character(s) at the Tapastic Winter Fest interacting with a character from another series you love. (Spread the love <3)
OR Draw you or your character(s) witnessing your favorite moment so far in the Tapastic Winter Fest story. (maybe the were key players in the character fumbling delivering the present?)
OR show us what your world booth looks like. What kind of wares would your comic characters be selling and how crazy would the booth design look?

As an added bonus, I'll share each person's awesome Winter Fest pictures on my Extra Fluff series and all my social media platforms with links back to each of your lovely comic series. <3
OR
Here's what I'm working on for you awesome people. At the end of the Tapastic Winter Fest, after all the episodes are posted, all the episodes are going to get collected and released on a new series on the Tapastic Staff13 account, making it easier for readers to read it all together in one series. I'd like to include these extra illustrations at the end, after the episode finale, and include all of you in on it. Would you guys like that instead of posting it in my own Extra series?
Join the Winter Fest madness by adding your own spin to it!

582,❄ Tapastic Winter Fest 2015 - Day 25❄ [FINALE],Events | Challenges,[],"Tapastic Winter Fest 2015 begins!

What is Tapastic Winter Fest 2015, you may ask?
Tapastic Winter Fest is a big comic collaboration event between 25 webcomic creators on Tapastic, that decided to get together and do something crazy for the holiday.
Our idea: To take over the Tapastic website. :dramatic lightning:
No, no, our idea is to have a bit of fun and throw all our comic characters into this multidimensional holiday winter market where readers of the series can enjoy seeing their favorite characters mingle and spread some holiday cheer.
We also hope to introduce readers to new series by having the episodes released in a new series daily and create a more interactive reading experience.
The episodes are set in the Tapastic Mutliverse where all the comic characters from these 25 separate comic series are able to meet and mingle and share wacky antics as they try to deliver a mysterious present to some guy called Tapastic Mascot (never heard of him) by midnight Xmas Eve.
We release a new episode daily, like an advent calendar, all they way till Dec. 25th when a big finale episode will be released. Follow the adventure from start to finish and keep an eye out for hidden Tapastic Mascots in each episode. The readers that can find them all will win a prize!
So with that, LET'S GET STARTED!

583,Tapastic Ad Revenue Program Details!,Events | Challenges,[]," Hey, hi, hello!
We're excited to announce that we're opening up our Ad Revenue Program to eligible creators on May 1st! 
Eligibility is super simple: You'll need to be 18 years or older and must have access to a Paypal account for deposits. That's it. 
Create. Share. Profit. 
We've been working super hard on all the behind the scenes mechanics to make all of this possible and wanted to celebrate this moment with everyone in our community. Peter came up with this great idea to use this service called Thunderclap in order to get the word out to as many readers and creators as possible. 
Thunderclap404 is a service that allows for anyone to contribute their social media (tumblr, twitter or facebook) accounts for a huge synchronized shoutout on the day of our launch.  
Please help us by lending your voice. Together with other creators on Tapastic, we can make our voices be heard. We can't do this without you. 
Thunderclap with Us!We believe that it's important to create a culture around rewarding creators for their hard work. All too often, we see sites take art from creators and repost them, never taking time to credit the original source and never paying out a single penny to the creators.
We want to change that.
We want to create a culture where we encourage readers to be active participants in the creative journey of artists - by directly supporting them. We understand that not everyone can support creators monetarily, but fear not! Just by reading, they'll be helping you out. 
Best of all? We're all in this together. Because we're home to so many creators and so many readers, we can demand better rates for ad revenue. This means that just by being part of the Tapastic community, you'll be helping other creators as well as yourself. 
Together, we're going to do great things. Now help us bring the noise with Thunderclap404.

585,#OnlineComicCon Social Event On Twitter (10.00am PST),Events | Challenges,[],"Hey everyone,
Jamie Me here. Me, #WebComicChat and the podcast group #BlackComicsChat are putting on a special crossover event on Twitter today. It starts at 10.00am, and it's accessible to comic creators (web ofc!), readers and journalists.
 
The event, like #ComicTalk that I run, is a great way to:
 **- Get new readers. - Interact with fellow creators. - Find valuable industry information.**
It would be great to get the Tapastic gang out in force, and hopefully I'll see a few familiar faces. The basics of the event are: I'll post questions starting at 10.00am PST, you tweet your answer while using the #OnlineComicCon hashtag, and then interact with other Twitter users doing the same.
If you follow @JamieMeWrites6 on Twitter you'll get the questions as they happen, and if you have any questions just ask.","[""Well, I'll try to join, it sounds pretty fun though I still don't get used to the form of writting in twitter (I ran out of space to write xD) But sounds fun!"", 'im not too much in twitter, ill try it when i ll be back home XD', 'sounds fun! im there ', ""All you need to do is have an account, answer the tweets from my account and add #OnlineComicCon, but here are some extra tips:\nDon't tag a username as that eats up space (unless you want to give someone a nod).\nIf you go over the tweet amount. Split it into two tweets and add 1/2, 2/2 or whatever. Just make sure you reply with the next part to your own tweet.\nHaving images ready for question one to show your comic is always a plus.\nOther than that...

First of all i want to say thanks for this great site.I was host in webtoon.comIn my opinion tapastic is lot better, but webtoon.com more popular in my country because of language choice.So i suggest tapastic use this feature too, I believe tapastic will be more popular if there is languages option.
I see that tapastic have translate feature, but i think different comic databases based on language will be more attractive to local readers. So they can directly search for comics in their local language

We've been hard at working building out the next generation of our mobile apps but still found time to sneak in this pretty cool site update. 
 
For creators, if you click on your profile icon and select ""Dashboard"" from the dropdown menu, you'll be able to access a list of your series. From there, go ahead and click on the pencil icon (edit) for any series you'd like to add a custom ad banner to.

It will appear directly below the episode next to the comment section. 
You can add any link you'd like and are not limited to only linking to crowdfunding platforms. Got a personal site you'd like to link to? How about a fellow creator who has an awesome series that's not getting enough love? Or maybe you want to start building out your social media presence. We wanted to make sure that this ad could be utilized in a wide variety of ways to fit the needs of every creator. 
We just released this update and it seems like everything went pretty smoothly except for a few minutes of laggy down time, which no one noticed. 
 
Well... almost no one...
Anyway, we also patched the bug that wasn't allowing creators to delete series. 
We've also upgraded our servers so that the site should be operating at a slightly faster speed. 
Looking forward to seeing what everyone comes up with for the custom banner ad! Feel free to show them off in this topic

I'd reach out again in a similar way, and make it so creators could contact me if they were interested. If for some reason this didn't happen one week I'd choose something trending on either Tapastic or Webtoon.\n-how long does it usually run?\nFor just an hour. This Sunday #JamieMeReads will be on for an hour, and then #ComicTalk is after for an hour too. This won't happen again likely as I'm just trying to test the new #JamieMeReads idea.\nApologies for the wall of text, but here is a breakdown of how it will work.\nAt the start time a tweet will be sent out with a link to the selected webcomic. People will then have 20 minutes to read the webcomic, and tweet'a'long as they do.\n20 minutes later another tweet will be sent out with another webcomic, and users will again read and tweet'a'long.\nFor the last twenty minutes I'm going to ask users to give feedback on the 40 minutes, suggest anything they feel will improve the event and then #ComicTalk will start at the start of the next hour.\nPhew, sorry about that. Ha ha, I wanted to get it down in writing as best as possible.

603,Grassblades Christmas giveaway!,Events | Challenges,[],"In celebration of the upcoming holiday, I'm doing a Christmas-giveaway! 
Giveaway-contents:
GrassbladesPart1-coverv4.png800x1131 795 KB
 1.) Signed copy of the Grassblades-booklet I’ve been selling at cons! I will scribble pictures in it on request! 
 
Masa-Akane-butterfly.png800x1131 637 KB
 2.) Two Grassblades-themed postcard prints - these are A5-sized, and of lovely quality! You will get them signed, either on the front or the back, as per request. [One of two available prints shown - there will be no tumblr-url on the actual print]

Christmas-giveaway-charms.png800x530 272 KB
 3.) Acrylic charms! Printed by the excellent people over at Zap! Creatives, these are lovely, high quality charms printed on black acrylic. 

Grassblades-bookmarkSmall.png306x1000 526 KB
 4.) Bookmarks! Laminated to be extra durable, one small bookmark and one larger bookmark - for larger books!

bonus-art.png3000x2000 564 KB
 5.) A piece of original art! You can request any character - or creature, or random image of your choice! - and I will draw it just for you! 
Rules:
1) This giveaway is only open to backers on Patreon! So to qualify for a chance to get all of this, you need to sign up as a backer on my Patreon-campaign3. 
2.) This giveaway is for backers of ALL LEVELSAll backers of all levels are eligible for this giveaway! You can get all of this shiny stuff for as little as 1 USD/month! And, of course, backing at 1 USD/month nets you access to sketchposts and extra comics if you choose to stick around! 
3.) You must be charged for the month of November.You’ll only qualify if you are charged for the month of November, because I'm trying to avoit pledge-baiting behaviour. As soon as backers have been charged, I will draw a random name from a virtual hat, and start putting the package together. Patreon-charges are processed early in the month, around the 2nd-4th. 
4.) Giveaway-packages will be sent out in early December! As soon as the charges are done processing, I’ll draw a winner and contact them for necessary details - like shipping addresses and what they want me to draw on that piece of original art. As soon as that’s done, I’ll put all of it in the mail. 
I estimate the shipping to be December 7th at the latest, and fingers crossed, it will all arrive before Christmas. 
.For several reasons, this giveaway will be restricted to Patreon-backers only. With the Support Program ending at the end of the month, and because international shipping does cost quite a bit of money, I am not able to open this up to everyone. At some point, I'm hoping to do an open giveaway where ALL readers are eligible, but right now, that is not feasible. 
Also, I want to thank my backers for sticking with me, which they have done through many hiccups and long months of both the build-up and posting of Grassblades. Without them, Grassblades as a project would not be the same. <3 ","['Bumping this up for residents of different time-zones - Grassblades giveaway!

In your browser's address bar, type in http://tapastic.com/episode/6

At the end of that URL type in any number from 1 to 200000 [I think tapastic is only at 158441 currently so save those high number till a month or so ]
Read whatever random comic episode you land on. [If there's no episode let us know and try again]

And tell us about it here! (More than it's good please, tell us why it's good  )
Please include a link so we can check it out too.


To kick it off, I chose number 146287And got a comic called Simple Stupid4, episode 9 ""How kid play tag now""
The episode I landed on is a nice gag strip. I enjoyed the humor of it and so I don't ruin the joke I won't explain it further, but know I ""liked"" it 
The art style is very simple but suits the purposes of the comic, I definitely recommend checking it out. It's also a series with only 7 subs so let's help show they some love.

Also feel free to do this as many times as you like. ","['oh my god i love this lol this is such a neat idea for a game xD\nI just found a classic Awkward Andy strip, titled ""Jitters""4 (oh boy . . . Awkward Andy . . . that\'s way back in Tapastic\'s history lol) and it\'s actually pretty funny. It hasn\'t been updated in a couple years, which is unfortunate, but the strip I found is still pretty chuckle worthy lol', 'Great idea!\nI came across the comic Smile More by Guy Paterson, specifically an episode called ""Blowing Bubbles"". The artwork is whimsical, with bright colors and cute characters. It seems to be a one-off strip-style comic, specifically kid-friendly. I\'d call it incredibly pleasant. ', 'Bad luck for me, I ending up landing on an episode that was just a black picture with the words ""episode 23"" on it……\nLet\'s try this again…I got a strip from the comic Pullcat http://tapastic.com/episode/444292I get the reference, although since it\'s an old comic it\'s a bit dated as a result. I like the work in the body language, the pose of the right character in particular is expressive.', ""I ran across a comic entitled The Zombies that Ate Britain. There's a couple of people dressed as Batman and Robin and talk of pizza and it looks like first zombie showed up but it doesn't appear the artist continued the story.\nhttp://tapastic.com/episode/265775"", 'http://tapastic.com/episode/426395\nStarpunch Girl fanart! ', 'I got an adorable collection of images called tako days by tomtom.  http://tapastic.com/episode/53852', ""Oooh, nice idea!\nI picked 2314, and I landed on a comic called Project Jikoku1, on The Price Paid for Prophecy2, page 27. This placed me smack-dab in the middle of what seems to be a flashback - a pretty dramatic one, too, promising intergalactic war and family conflicts at the same time! It's drawn in a pretty old-school manga style, in nicely toned black and white, if you're into that kind of thing. "", 'Ahhhh, those are so cute!', 'http://tapastic.com/episode/172832  I dont watch breaking bad but i thought this was humorous XD \nnice idea!', 'Well, that17 was short... o_O', ""Out of the 150000 + episodes on Tapastic that's the one you found?! Lol that's hilarious. XD"", 'I tried the roulete method and found this page of Groovy, Kinda.

609,Looking for ad-banners to appear IN my comic,Events | Challenges,[],"Heya
My latest comic takes place at a rugby match and has several advertising hoardings in the background. Instead of making up general adverts I thought it would be cool to advertise real webcomics on them. It will be totally free as the size and visibility of the ads will vary depending on how far along the pitch they appear, but I will include links to any comics I feature in the text below the comic. Most of these adverts should appear in three of the comic's panels.
So if you have a rectangular landscape banner ad that's not too wide and would like to appear, let me know. My example banner's proportions are approximately 3x1 so that would be ideal, but wider is okay, as most banners are. The criteria are that the banner must be SFW (although the comic doesn't have to be, but let me know if it is NSFW so I can warn people in the text below).
I'm mainly imagining putting up banners that you already have prepared for adverts, as I wouldn't want people to spend too long on them and then find their advert at the far end of the stand.
I include below the request I posted on twitter so you have an idea for how it would look. The comic itself will be a combination of sci-fi and (obviously) sporting themes... Oh, and I intend to post it next Monday 26th (on my main site, a week late on Tapastic) so would need any banners by the end of Saturday ideally.

I think I originally said the Tapastic post would appear next week but it seems my Tapastic posts have just caught up with my main site, so it should appear tomorrow.\nI'll include shrunk copies of the banners below the comic on my main site linking to your sites, so even if your banner is in the distance in the comic, people can still find you.\nThanks again. I'm looking forward to posting it!"", ""oh ! that's awesome ! thank you !

612,Happy Asexual Awareness Week!,Events | Challenges,[],"Hey folks! It's that time of year again--Asexual Awareness week! As an ace person, it's always exciting to find comics with ace characters in them.  But I don't exactly have a list of these comics 0x0 So to celebrate AAW this year, I thought it would be fun to find all the comics with ace characters! But that's hard to do alone, so if you know of any, list 'em here!The ones I know of with outed ace MCs:Supernormal Step6Heroes of Thantopolis3Questionable Content3Lackadaisy6Numb3Jupiter2Ignition Zero1Shades of A3Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures1Horizontal Process1

Please add to my list of comics (on Tapastic or elsewhere) with Ace characters! I know there must be more! 
p.s. In case you don't know what asexuality is, here's a comic that explains it16! Neato, eh?
p.p.s. I've read most of the tapastic comics, but I haven't read every comic on this list! Some of these comics may contain mature content. </ caveat>
p.p.p.s. there are lots of one-shot comics that discuss asexuality, (which is great!), but these are the on-going comics with ace characters. If you are interested in finding all those one-shot goodies though, here's a tumblr1 that aims to do just that!

I know there's already Inktober and Drawlloween is supposed to be a month long event but this bright spark idea just hit me now.  I've been seeing the Drawlloween event on other art sites and thought it would be fun to start the tradition here as well  I've already seen the thread where we can zombify our characters that's also a grand idea but I though this would be fun too.
Sooooo basically creators can post artwork of their characters with a dark/halloween theme.  It can be any character they wish but it would be nice if it were a character from their comic so we get to know more comics and creators and get to see amazing artworks.  Sooooo let the spooookinesss BEGIN!!!
This is an old drawing I did for halloween just to start off. I'll be posting another artwork with the characters of my comic next time

For those of you who are curious about it but don't feel like drawing one yourself - check out the website and find people and venues! I'm planning on doing a live stream, maybe on Periscope (?) so that people can participate in one way or another. (Will link it here later, when I know how it's going down)
Are you joining in? It's good to have some sort of contact with other people, especially during the toughest hours during the night/early morning. ","[""I really, really want to! I've done it a couple of times - once together with other people - and it is a blast. Unfortunately, I've got stuff I need to do on the 3rd/4th, so I have to settle for some really intense storyboarding instead of the full-on 24 hour comic. \nBut for anyone who is hesitant about trying for the first time - I really recommend it, especially if you can find a bunch of people to do it together with. There is a big difference between doing it solo and sitting together with a group, drawing for 24 hours straight."", ""I've tried participating in this before but I could never hit the 24 page count in 24 hours.

Like... instead of a full on comic make more of a graphic novel or 24 illustrations for a text or something?You'll get it down, I'm sure! (Just been thinking a lot about variants for this thing in general :D)"", ""Oh, don't worry! 2011 I made my own version that wasn't quite following the rules, but hey, in comics there are no rules I've heard! So I was working for 10 days straight and still decided to do the 24hcd so I made it in all the spare time I had during those 10 days. It was highly influenced by work, I must add  I tried not to think about the comic while I wasn't actually drawing, and it worked out ok in the end."", ""I haven't been able to participate in this for years (health is not well enough for it)\nBut I want to at least do SOMETHING on that day. Maybe I'll cut down the page count to arthritis speeds and see if I can do 6 pages or something?\nOr maybe try for a 24 hour stream, or 24 hangout with other people drawing comics?"", ""@kurapikasuki Yeah, doing SOMETHING when there's an event on is always fun - for Free Comic Book Day, I did a 9-hour stream of me working on comics, because I didn't have time to finish a comic specifically for that day. \nThe 24 hour stream sounds fun, though!

623,Secret Santa Idea for 2015,Events | Challenges,[],"Nothing helps more to improve one's skill than practicing and a great and fun way of getting some practice in would be doing a Secret Santa.

People who sign up choose which of their characters they want to be drawn.
Each person is given a secret santa and has a given time period to complete it (month or two)
When finished, you can just message your secret santa and yours will message you.

If you like it or you have questions, let me know. I think it would be a fun idea.

Nice to meet you everyone on Tapastic!This is basically a copy-pasta from my webcomic's orignal site Pokemmo.thewebcomic.com
But if you would like the Tapastic site: Pokemmo - The Webcomic13 
Copy pasta:Orginal link: Deviantart linkHey everyone! Infinite here, creator of Pokemmo - The webcomic.We're still getting started with the story, but in the mean time we'll be needing more TRAINERS!Yup, we need character designs. You can have the chance to be in the story!
Please note, not every submission will be in the story. We will be judging on how descriptive your character is and creativity of your character.We are not judging how good your art is, but we prefer it if you could keep it as neat as possible. Traditional artists may join!
Read below for requirements:.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.
Requirements:
1.) Must have this application filled out-The download files for the .psd are in the download button on deviantart while the .png file can be found here: .png file site1
2.) Be following Pokemmo - the webcomic! (Not required but I would love it if you did!)
3.) Submit entry HERE: Submission site-I will not accept it if it's COMMENTED HERE or NOTED to me on deviantart.

.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.::.Common questions:
What pokemon can we use or cannot use?-Since this is based off the GAME Pokemmo.eu, you can find the list of currently available pokemon here: Pokemmo's Held Items and Pokemon LocationsWe will be checking if all your pokemon are eligable!
Do we need all 6 slots filled?-That's up to you. Remember we are judging on creativity. If you have an all uber dragon team or something, your chances will probabbly be slim.
What is the level cap?-There is no level needed! Just simply put the name/nickname of your pokemon.
What is Trainer Type?-Breeder, Twins, Aroma lady, Daycare, etc. Any kind of trainer will do.
Can we be apart of Team Rocket?-Ahaha, yes!
Do we need a story? Or character information?-A story isn't needed, but if you want to give in character descriptions (like in rp groups) then there's a box in the submission form that you can enter your information there at.
Any more questions feel free to ask!","[""Hey hun, most of the links you've posted dont work.

641,Tapastic Skype Group,Events | Challenges,[],"SO I had a lovely Skype chat with a few other folks here from Tapastic, and it gave me the idea of having an actual Skype group for Tapastic readers/artists/etc. as I don't think there is one.

642,Outcast Kingdom 1st birthday: Monster Zodiac!,Events | Challenges,[],"My comic, Outcast Kingdom2, just turned 1 year old! party noisesIn celebration, here's a little something for you all: The Monster Zodiac! (part 1 of 2)
Note: This is not meant to represent any sort of canonical astrology in the world of Outcast Kingdom, nor is it meant to necessarily represent how those monsters act. It's just a re-imagining of our horoscope signs but with the sorts of creatures found in Outcast Kingdom instead of the classic signs. Just for fun.
(if you want to know which one corresponds to you, either pick which ever sounds like you, or find the one of the matching element / modality to your real-life sign.)
WITCHElement: WaterModality: CardinalPros: Caring, adaptable, responsive, wise, intuitiveCons: Clingy, secretive, obsessive, manipulativeThose born under the sign of the Witch have an affinity for nature and the spiritual, and avoid excessive materialism. They value knowledge over wealth, pets over possessions, and family over business. They tend to be kind and compassionate, and wise beyond their years. However, they tend to keep secrets-- even from family and loved ones. If you are not part of something they are interested in, they are unlikely to share it with you. If you know someone of this sign that you are not on good terms with, be weary of any gifts they may give you-- that kindness may be a trick, as they can be cunning and spiteful when at their worst.
HORSEMANElement: FireModality: FixedPros: Loyal, confident, ambitious, encouraging, strong-willedCons: Over zealous, pretentious, stubbornThose born under the sign of the Horseman are pro-active and disciplined. They are focused, trustworthy, and determined. However, they tend to solve everything they can by head strong physical force. They are fiercely loyal, even when it may be a good idea to question that loyalty. They also can have trouble expressing themselves sometimes, so if you have a friend of this sign, you may need to be patient with them.
ZOMBIEElement: EarthModality: MutablePros: Patient, serving, uncomplicated, cooperativeCons: Unthinking, cold, tactless, unobservantThose born under the sign of the Zombie tend to be the “slow and steady” type, and will usually take a long time to do well a job that others would do in haste. They tend to work together well with others of like-minded behavior, working in groups for maximum effect. They rarely consider themselves too good for a job, and are content to work simple jobs. However, they don't often think things through, and will likely keep trying to push a stuck door open instead of considering the possibility that it may need to be pulled.
VAMPIREElement: AirModality: CardinalPros: Diplomatic, graceful, social, charismatic, passionateCons: Unforgiving, indulgent, manipulative, egocentric, proudThose born under the sign of the Vampire are born leaders. They have the grace and social prowess to impress business contacts and win favors from friends. They tend to be clever, charming, and wise. However they can be self-centered, and take unfair advantage of their friendships. If you have a friend of this sign, you may have to learn to say no to him-- no matter how hard that may be. But do not bruise his ego, for they can be proud, and do not forgive easily.
GHOSTElement: WaterModality: FixedPros: Empathetic, wise, gracefulCons: Emotional, dramatic, cold, prone to depression.Those born under the sign of the Ghost often seem mature for their age-- for better and worse. They can be calm, cool, and wise. They are patient, though somewhat introverted. Though rarely cheerful, they are happy just to be at peace in a quiet room. Perhaps reading an old book. However, they can be cold, overly dramatic, and tend to play the martyr. They can be extremely nostalgic, becoming attached to a thing or place-- always holding onto the object, or refusing to leave the place they are obsessed with. They can become racked with guilt, needing help from friends to forgive themselves.
HUMANElement: FireModality: MutablePros: Generous, idealistic, hard-working, inventive, progressive, cooperativeCons: Careless, irresponsible, superficial, reckless, self-righteousThose born under the sign of the Human are industrious and hard working. They dream big and strive to achieve those dreams at any cost. They form strong bonds of friendship with anyone they have common grounds with-- be it family ties, a shared interest, or sharing a home town. However, they can be careless in their pursuits, unaware of consequences. They can also be judgmental of others, and exhibit a 'holier-than-thou' attitude, and want to be recognized for any good that they do.

Where do you fit in all this? Does your equivalent sign sound like you? Does another one? If your sign isn't up yet, I'll post the other six within a couple of days... once I think of a good one for the air/mutable (Gemini equivalent).
As an Aquarius, mine isn't up yet either. Though I can be a bit of a Ghost sometimes. Just a bit.

648,HoT’s Tapastic Anniversary thanks YOU!,Events | Challenges,[],"Today, August the 13th, is my webcomic Heroes of Thantopolis's9 1 year anniversary of posting on Tapastic! WOO!It's been a slow climb to the audience the comic has now, and along the way I've been buoyed and encouraged by a group of positive and friendly frequent commenters. You guys make my update days! I love hearing from you and interacting with you. Sure, sometimes I can tease and be oblique, and I do love a random comment roleplay or discussion thread, but reading your comments is fuel to the fire of me being excited to work on my comic every day, and especially share it here on Tapastic! This site has truly been a great opportunity for me and my comic, and so many of my friends and their comics, to reach a wider and engaged audience. 
So to celebrate 1 year, 118 episodes and over 3 thousand comments on HoT, I drew ghost characters for a handful of the star frequent commenters! You guys are the ones who comment on nearly every page, engage me in interesting discussions and are the ones I've gotten to know on the site. HoT wouldn't be what it is without you!When designing a ghost character, I took inspiration from your username, your icon, and/or from conversations we've had! If you're curious as to why I designed it this way or that, feel free to ask. (some people I couldn't find their forum usernames/I can only mention 10 users in a post - use ctrl + F to search your username. I also spelled some people's names wrong on the image, forgive me!)

651,Colors Comic Community: Lets Figure What Were Doing EXACTLY (CLOSED FOR NOW),Events | Challenges,[],"HEY GUYS! First i would like to say thank you for those who replied to my messages. I did them late that night so I hope they were coherent ! If you are seeing this simply because of the thread, then feel free to stick around and be apart of what we are trying to accomplish.
Ok now to the nitty-gritty.

=== The Inspiration to Colors Comic Community
For the past month or so, i have been preparing myself for cartooning and art, and i was searching for art/cartoonist communities and i had a hard time finding any. So i decided that once i get my own cartoon up, i should work on making my own community.
So here i was, thinking about what it could be, and during that same time my brother was making a music video for a song called ""Colors"" by Trocadero (you can listen to the song here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Jy-E0_st82) and so naturally i heard the song many times. In the song, one of the lines goes ""When we're together, colors don't matter much to us"" and that line is what inspired me the most.
Ever since then, i have had ideas of Colors (that is what i will be referring to instead of saying ""Colors Comic Community"" a thousand times) and what i would like it to be. Eventually, i decided that the main motif would be people having fun with paintballs/water balloons. Because wouldn't that be fun? I would like Colors to be associated with the idea of paint globs and splashes and having our characters in our separate series having fun coloring each other with these globs (because ""When we're together, colors don't matter much to us"" )
That kind of mentality and idea is what helped me set the foundation of what i would like to see colors become, somewhere fun and carefree. 

===Our Goals
 When coming up with Colors Comic Community, I have planed for it to become two things:
First, I would want it to be a place where a creator can advertise his/her series. I realize that people are very busy and can't always do things for the fun of it. So anything that they are apart of will have a link in the description to there series (kind of like a credits section). I also hope that readers could see Colors and find creators through Colors.
Second, I would like it to be a place where creators can come together and draw together. Obviously we all love drawing and cartooning so Colors will focus on getting people to do that together. I want Colors to be a stress reliever for people, so if there is ever a deadline, it will be one discussed with the creator(s) prior to the start of the project. 
I believe that these two concepts should be happening almost simultaneously (there is one exception that will be addressed). Colors should be advertising creators while still keeping a sense of fun and ""togetherness"" amongst the members.

===The Series Published Under Colors
Colors will have 4-5 series that it will publish (at first):
1.) This series will be a simple introduction to Colors. It will address things like what we are/do, how to join (easy, be a cartoonist and just ask to join, we could also have a simple thing asking them to agree to the code-of-conduct just so that they know what is expected) and the code of conduct (will be addressed later). It should be inviting and encourage the readers to check out the creators that they find under Colors. I feel that this is self-explanatory to why it'd be good.
2.)The second series will be dedicated to cartoonists advertising each of their series. Each series will have one page reserved to them, and it can be updated once a month. On that page, they can post anything to promote their series, its really just up to them on what it will be. The reason why this would be a good idea to have is because people need a reason to be apart of the community. Free advertising would be a great incentive to join us, because not everyone has time to just throw around. We should consider the fact that a person might join, throw in their free advertising, and then never be active again. As a response, we should say that a member must be active once every month (is that too short of a time?) to stay a member (along with their free advertisement). Being active doesn't have to be posting cartoons and pictures all the time, it could be as little as contributing to ideas, supporting other creators, or the putting their own personal touch to cartoons/pictures that are put up on the page.
3.) Here is probably one of the main series for Colors. This one is still in development on what exactly it will be, and it is something i would like to specifically address in the comments with you guys. But what I am thinking is that we create a character that symbolizes what Colors is and this person interacts with the different cartoonists characters. I'm not sure if it should be something that has a loose plot and the artists get to define what specifically happens (ie we tell the artist that ""person 1 gets from point A to point B with the helps of persons 2,3, and 4,"" then the artist chooses how this happens) or if it should have a very defined plot and artists artists fill in the holes. This comic is meant to bring many artists together and have a large spectrum of talents contribute to one story. This is when a cartoonist gets involved with the story, we would set up a schedule/deadline for what ever they end up doing. DISCLAIMER: You don't have to contribute to this story to be apart of Colors (but it will be encouraged). 
Also, i'd like to consider the possibility of not every cartoonist apart of this story should be doing everything in one little section. If a cartoonist would like to contribute, but they don't have a lot of time on their hands, they could offer to color, draw the scenery, etc. It might make it easier for people to be apart of it if they didn't have the responsibility of making dialogue, drawing and finalizing the characters, coloring, environment, etc. Also, one cartoonist can be as much, or as little, involved in it as they would want to. If they want to help in every strip, then awesome! If they just want to help once, thats also dope! Each cartoonist that contributed to each page will be included in the description with a link to their profile page.Again, i would like to revisit this.
4.) This last series would spotlight any project made by two or more artists. This is something that should be included because it would be another way for an artist to advertise themselves while still being connected and participating with other creators. The creators would be encouraged, and asked, to post the creation with their subscribers so that, in turn, they will be advertising both Colors and the other artists involved in the piece. As a result, the two creators will have just shared their fan-bases with each other, opening them both up to more readers.
5.) FAQ series? This could just be incorporated in the first series.
If you have an idea of another series you think could work, please, don't hesitate to say so. Im all ears!

===How Will Colors Comic Community run?
In the Description of Colors (the profile description) will include a small bit to cover who we are, our email for publishing, and the admins (maybe). Also, it will say that questions, comments, and concerns about Colors should be sent through PM (so that we can split the jobs a bit easier). If a question is asked and we feel that it is important, well post it on the wall (and possibly a FAQ series)
=Publishing Art
1.) Email system: Since it would be a terrible idea to let every member have access to Colors account, a creator wanting to publish their piece will email Colors (i haven't set an email yet, but i will) with all of the information and pictures needed (and wanted) to publish it, a long with which series to post it to. Then we would simply transfer everything over.
=Responsibilities of Admins
As much as i would like Colors to be more community driven rather than leader driven, there will be the need of admins to make sure everything is running smoothly. Hopefully, this will only take a small team of only a few people (especially at first). These people will have the username and password to Colors so that they may use the account for their purposes. The admins will have power over running Colors, and they will be asked to do a minimum of one these things.
1.) Forum threads: Having a strong presence in the forums will do greatly for getting more creators to get interested in what we are trying to accomplish. Here, we could start threads on the forums to invite people to our community. We could use it to start mini-events hosted by Colors. Also talking to others on different threads to create a presence around people. The admins apart of this won't have to be spending hours upon hours on the forums, but if they could post a new thread maybe once every week or two, that would help a ton.
2.) Code of Conduct: Everyone is encouraged to report something that could go against our Code of Conduct (see below) and the admins in charge of this area will asses the situation and either reprimand, suspend, or ban the person from being a member of Colors. Unfortunately, if it is a reader that is going against our code, all that we can do is reprimand them (unless they are breaking a Tapastic rule) (i will be apart of this)
3.) Publishing Content: I do believe i will be able to take care of this for the most part, but i may ask someone for help if I know i will be away, or some unexpected even happens. But basically, creators will email Colors the content that they wish to publish. Then this admin will simply copy/paste the information into the publishing operation.
4.) Community Q and A: If readers or creators have any questions, these admins will be the ones to answer them. I don't expect there to be too many questions once we get things rolling, but incase there are, we should have one or two people be prepared to answer them (i will also be apart of this)
5.) Community Presence: Much like the forum threads, these admins will simply be there to talk with people on our walls and comments. Any of the admins can be apart of this, as long as they are friendly and supportive to the community.
I know this does seem like a lot of things to do, but really, none of them will take up too much time. The two that i can see being most time consuming would be the Forums and Community Presence. Both of those shouldn't be taken to large scales anyways, and if there are even four or five admins, this should be no problem.

===Code of Conduct
Im the type of person who assumes that people aren't jerks, so this is going to be weird for me, and feel free to add to this if there is stuff i miss.
1.) No Spamming: If you are found spamming, you will be suspended, and possibly banned, from being a member at Colors.
2.) Don't blatantly say that some ones art/comic/etc is bad. If you disagree or think that you could help them improve as a cartoonist, by all means, give them ADVICE. Don't be rude and destructive, be nice and constructive!
3.) Don't advertise when inappropriate. The appropriate times to advertise is the series specifically for advertising and when credited for helping out on a project in the credits. If a person feels that there could be another time appropriate, they would have to talk to one of the admins.
4.) This one should be obvious, but follow Tapastic's rules, we don't want to get reprimanded by them.
5.) If you are an admin, and you are found breaking these rules, you will be put up for a suspension and possibly a ban from being an admin and member of Colors.

=== What need to happen to get started
Before we get Colors rolling, there will be multiple things that WILL need to happen.DISCLAIMER: You don't have to be an admin to participate in the following activites.
==Thumb Nails, Banners, and Profile picture
With each series we will need a thumbnail and a banner. For each of these, i was thing that we could all contribute in a way to the different things. For example, in one of the series' banner, we could have the colors logo in the center with our characters on each side throwing paint globs across at each other. This type of brainstorming can come after we have discussed the issues and ideas above.
== First Series Intro
This will be a mini project that doesn't require every one to be apart. Probably three people could work together on this together but more are welcome. If anyone is interested in this after we have talked, then contact me and we'll get things rolling.
== Pre-Launch Advertisement
Now with this, i don't want to make anyone advertise if they don't want to, and i don't plan on asking anyone to do it again but it would help a lot if we got word spread around through forums and to your subscribers pre-launch and when it does launch. We don't really need ""hype"" but it would be nice if when we launched, people would already know about Colors and be interested in being apart of it.
== Posible Character Design
With the idea of having some sort of story special to Colors, we would need a character that is special to Colors. Right now, i have not come up with a specific design but what i was thinking was that what ever we do make, it should be simple enough were any cartoonist could get the key features and be able to draw him/her in their own style. I don't want this character to be so complex that someone (like me) couldn't get everything down, but instead have one or two major features that anyone could make him and their own style and that any reader could see it in any style and know who it is. I hope this is making any sense, if not, do say so!
Everything that has been said is up to change. Nothing is permanent so if you got an idea, do tell!
Thank you guys for reading all the way through and helping me out. If this boat is ever going to float, there will be some work need, so i understand if you can't be apart of the setup process. Again thanks! Your guys rock!","[""I'm gonna read the whole thing later, but the very title of the thread has me interested.

I'm pretty interested in it xD"", ""Hey! I was reading through the responsibilities that the admins would have, to try and understand the full scope of what this collective was about, and one of the responsibilities of the admins that caught my eye I feel might need bringing up. The responsibility in particular is number 3, which from my understanding states that the creators in the collective will email you and/or the admins their content, and then you guys publish it. Reason I wanted to bring that up, is that a LOT of creators are very uncomfortable to downright against giving publishing control of their content to someone else. \nAs this collective is quite new, and currently just a fostering idea, the possible negative word of mouth that might go around due to that is not something I imagine you want or need. I would (personally) recommend trying to find some way to connect all of them to the collective WITHOUT you guys being the publishers of everything, as while that may take more upfront work, the amount of people that would want to join, and the overall view of the collective would definitely improve! ^^\n(As an addendum, I feel that the post as a whole is a bit too vague, neither me nor any of my friends are fully sure the content that you're looking for. Is it series like we think, or is it more like art jams? I feel that is something that should definitely be addressed, as if a creator can't understand what the collective is, they lose trust in it as a whole.)"", ""dang, i hadn't thought about there being a problem with publishing, but it totally makes sense. Im afraid to make it an open account where anyone can log on and post because there will be someone who will just mess the entire system. Should we just have people post on the wall of anything that they create together and then maybe spotlight different posts here and there?\nAlso, to address you second thing, i tried to make it more specific but i guess im still pretty vague. Id like to eventually have it where people would feel comfortable to do art jam like stuff (and hopefully host events) but i do realize that people won't feel comfortable just jumping in with random people, so this series will hopefully be a gateway kind of thing, and as people get to know each other we'll then start to really push for art jam style stuff. so yes, art first it will mostly be the series"", ""Making collectives on Tapastic is a bit tedious imo if the account isn't to be shared by all users so they can post their content on their own and manage their series as they wish (which, of course, might come with a bit of troubles if someone tries to log in at the same time as another!) I personally would neither trust nor want someone to post things for me, not unless I've known them for a long enough time to have built trust in them enough to be quite sure they're not also stealing my pages and reposting them under their name on another platform. We sadly can't afford to be naive...\nTime ago, I made this suggestion:\n\nsuggestion_collabs_by_izz_noxfox-d80cajd.gif373x674\n\n...and I would personally rather wait for such functionalities to exist to possibly form a collective on Tapastic, or never do it, I guess. I've been working on my series for over one year and there's no way I'd delete it all and repost it under another account as it would make me lose all the comments I got (and views, likes, shares...) and I'm not sure all of my subscribers would follow easily if it means being forcefully subscribed to all notifications from the group account (which they might not be intrested in).\nI guess you're here thinking more of creating new series, but then again, that means more work for any creator who already has a series to struggle with. Maybe you'd have an easier time finding new creators who'd like to create a universe together and make series based on it? I think people are more likely to join a group if they can get to know the other members first."", ""uhhhmmHello :3 I'm a bit late DX but uhm.. I was wondering If I could join this project? :3"", ""oh sorry miniaome, as you might have guessed, this project hasn't gone anywhere, which is actually ok.\nWhile dreaming up Colors, my main thing was to get creators together and having fun. After being apart of the Tapastic community, i now realize that everything i really want is easily accessible. I really wanted to be alongside of other creators, and Tapastic is already creating this.\nAlso, Colors would be difficult to make with the features that tapastic currently has. Maybe in the future when Tapastic has grown and implemented a few key features, ill revamp this idea. But until then, Colors will go in the dark.\nThanks for your interest anyways!"", 'oowwww :[ What a bummer... ok well thanks anyway > <', 'Am I late? Aww oh well.', 'yeah, i think the biggest issue was publishing. As soon as Tapastic allows multiple cartoonists share a series or something, then ill revamp this idea, because making people let us submit their work would scare a lot of creators.\nSo, for now, its is closed.

652,30 DAY Drawing Challenge,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everyone !A few weeks ago, I made a Q&A. And in the questions, someone (hello monkeysam) asked me how I kept practising drawing. So to help this webfriend to keep motivation to create, to change our minds and to get better, I made a little drawing Challenge !
The goal is not to make awesome stuff, just to have fun through this little challenge and force ourself to create, because we only get better by practising. I do many challenges, and when I end one, I'm so proud that I can’t wait for the next one.
So this time I made one ! One drawing everyday ! And I start the 1st of August ! Will you join me ?

Oh yeah, and I want to see your creations, so you can post it here, also pm me a link with the 30 drawings (or less if you don’t end it) so I don't miss it. I want to make an article with that on my website ! Why not Tag using #NEWCHALLENGE and tag me on twitter or instagram @sow_ay so I can see it. That probably will make my day too.

653,Comic playlist competition!,Events | Challenges,[],"I use playlists in writing and drawing my comic, to help drive ideas and inspiration, and I wondered what songs other people would put together for my comic. so:
what to do:


read the comic12 (as much or little as you think you need to make a playlist)
make the playlist (preferably btwn 30 and 50 minutes, best on 8tracks3 )
link the comic in the description of your playlist
link me to your playlist here!

prizes:

first place: a playlist for their own comic (made by me), and a drawing of their main character
second place: a playlist for their own comic
third place: a drawing of any character they want from whatever series they like

everyones playlists will be favourited by me.
tips:

heres my own playlist1 for inspiration, you can use songs from that playlist as much as you like in your own, but be sure to make it original
if you use a site like 8tracks that allows cover art, cover art will contribute to your chance at winning. hmu if u want panels from the comic w/out speech bubbles. you have permission to  manipulate my art for this. hipstery aesthetic covers that suit are cool too. be creative!

658,Muse: A call to creators,Events | Challenges,[],"Muses are fickle beasts but loyal to their creators...to an extent. 
Hello everyone! Soon I will be releasing a webseries that will not only be a choose-your-own-adventure styled comic for its readers but a possible way for creators to subtly promote themselves while interacting with other creators. 
My goal is to make a comic that not only encourages its readers to participate but fellow creators as well. Whether it be in lending OCs from various series or contributing in drawing the strips! 
The rules are simple - If you wish to take part as a creator you must provide references of your character. - If you wish to contribute drawn strips: Wonderful! But please tell me ahead of time. - If you wish to just be a reader, that's fine too! The comic itself will give directions in how to participate that way.
The plot for the series will start off as so:
Muses are creatures that keep guard of their host's [that's you as a creator!] imagination and everything inside it. They keep the characters in order and the world up-to-snuff. But what happens when one particular muse seems to go rogue and start to not only go imagination-hopping but attempt to destroy the host's imaginative world?  
When one muse's world is erased by this rogue she chases after him and is pulled in to various creator's own worlds and lands in attempt to keep this rogue from causing further destruction. 
So now it is your job as a creator to decide if you are going to aide this muse on her quest or are you just stuck in the sidelines?
To give a bit more clarification; Think of it similar to the game Kingdom hearts. The main character/Muse will be visiting various worlds that can be different comic series here on tapastic [and don't worry, you don't have to be a fantasy series to make things interesting!]. Each creator is allowed one visit to their comic world in this comic and the ability to have their characters interact with the muse. Whether it be helping her or hindering her. As well if the plot sees fit, you can either have a character continue on with the muse or create a muse of your own! But keep in mind the audience plays a very large part in the direction of this story.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!","[""\\owo/ That sounds AWESSSOOMEEE Hades! <3 I think I might like to lend a character for a scene. I'm not sure yet which world I could lend though. :T"", ""oh man i'd love to do a world hop to either of your comics ouo that'd be great fun. \nThe muse wont be hopping in to any comics right off the bat since there will be a small scene before hand to attempt to explain everything xD\n@joannekwanIt is actually  a story I've been sitting on for YEARS but unable to give a life too so this will help with that. ouob and great!

I could lend references or do strips if needed. (assuming the strips wouldn't go above my technical limitations.)"", ""i'm sure we can make something work ouob\n@joannekwanof course! I am very welcome to creator's making their own muses! They can appear as HOWEVER you want them too as well."", ""I'd love to share one of my characters!

664,"Ok tap, let’s play a game",Events | Challenges,[],"I know that as creators the idea of Self Criticism = Self Destructiveness can run a little rampant and tear us apart at our worst moments. 
So, I propose we play a game! 
THERE IS BUT ONE RULE IN THIS GAME. You must NOT become self-destructive to yourself or cause others to become so!
How to play the game: 

List 2 examples of why you love art / writing / comics / making all of the both / etc. 
List 1 criticism about your work. Only one. As well as attempt to suggest a way to fix or work on this criticism. 
List 1 positive thing about your work. It can be a strength / feeling toward your work / response of others to your work.
Link your work to us!! But please, don't use this an excuse to only self promote. :[ That makes us sad. Just a link, not a massive text wall on why we need to read your work. 
List 1 criticism for the poster above you. 
List 1 positive trait to the poster above you. 

I will try and start things off :]

I love creating because I want to tell stories and this kinda is a cheat sheet at getting things out of my head. 
I can draw my own otps kissing face and no one will care cuz it is canon. 8D
A criticism for my work is that I am really bad with hands and sometimes they look like mutant aliens on my poor character's wrists. 
> A way to fix this is to possibly do more hand studies to understand the anatomy and get in more practice, practice practice. 
Positive thing! I put a lot of effort in to expressions. :]

A link to my work is over here!2
For the poster above me:

Although the forum is rather nice, Babi ji seems to be determined to get me to see a love guru but I already feel that I am taken and well cared for by my partner. :[ This is very conflicting to me.
Lovely community here on the forums <3
","[""I love art for it's storytelling and how it can emotionally impact someone without saying (or even reading) a word! A criticism I have about my own work (ink and paint) is that I sometimes have a hard time figuring out shading on clothing. Folds can just get really confusing after looking at them for a while. Sometimes I just go cross eyed! A positive thing about my work is that I have a good understanding of shading the face, which I used to really struggle with. \nHere's a link to the comic I work on, Kamikaze3. \nkamikaze banner.jpg1280x460 117 KB\n \nThe one criticism I have for you @Marchen is that sometimes I feel like your lead, Thal, has the same expression for way too many panels. I get he's worried or scared a lot, and there's only so many expressions you can have for that, but small things can help. We've had the same problem with a few of our scenes, so we try to mix it up by having a character wince, twist their mouth a bit more, or playing with how wide or closed the eyes are. Even pupil size can push things just a bit more. There's points where I feel like your (and our) expressions could go MUCH crazier but still fit in with the story. On the flip side, I adore your color choices and the way you pose bodies! Keep up the awesome work there!! <3 \nThis is a great idea! Looking forward to the results here   "", ""\ni love art because when making art you can zone out, get lost in it, forget all words. and i love comics because theyre so diverse and vibrant and full of brilliant art and a large amount of young and innovative creators.\ni think in my work the speech bubbles arent quite up to scratch, and i should find a program other than sai to do them on\ni believe the characters in my comic are all different and well developed, with very interesting backstories\nheres my comic4\ntheres an awful lot of comic, so ive only read so far up to '3 months later' so far but the only criticism i can find is that the art style for the characters doesnt match up to the backgrounds; the backgrounds have lots of texture and tone, whereas the character drawings remind me more of an american superhero cartoon, not a bad thing, but its a big contrast. maybe try layering a texture over them? its not really a big deal.\nyour character designs are unique and intriguing, the way markesha looks alone makes me want to know more. also, love the backgrounds! (i know the rules said list one, but i already sort of mentioned that one anyway)\n\nim definitely gonna try to catch up with your comic and subscribe once i get there."", 'To me, there are different kinds of art. One of my favorite quotes is something along the lines of ""A painter paints a picture on canvas, a musician paints a picture on silence, and a writer paints a picture on the mind."" In a way I\'m all three, and I love the imagery of the quote, and it\'s one of the reasons I like the creative process. The second reason I like comics is because a picture is worth 1000 words. I love to write, but the descriptive purposes of a single image is more powerful than a whole page. \nOne criticism of my own work it the inconsistency. The grand total of my art experience is 4 high school classes, each teaching something different (intro which covers everything, drawing 1 which covers the basics of pencil sketching, ceramics 1 which covers the basics of manipulating clay, and graphic arts 1 which basically teaches the student how to use a tablet and the software (which was ps cs 4) ). I haven\'t had any real, in depth teachings, so my art style is inconsistent. The best and only way to fix it is practice.\nThe positive thinking about my work is that I feel what shading I do have is well done, as in it doesn\'t seem distracting to me. \nHere\'s my link: http://m.tapastic.com/series/Tales-of-Adestria-Quixel1  (fairly new, only a few pages)\nCriticism: ( for demon house) The shadows seem a little off. Some of them were too hard edged, other were misshapen in some places, and the coloration was sometimes off.\nCompliment: I really liked the expressions. They fit with the tone of the story, and weren\'t too exaggerated. They also gave the characters more personality.', 'Ooo I like this game! I\'ll play ^.^ - One thing I love about art is how amazing it is to see your characters on the screen/page/canvas in front of you when before, it only existed in your mind. Being able to share that with others is beyond cool.  - the second thing I love about the creative process is that it takes you away to another place and yet helps you process the ""real world"". If that\'s not magic, I don\'t know what is ^.^ - One criticism for my work is line of action. I\'ve read tons of articles on how to create flow/movement in art, but I don\'t think I\'ve gotten a handle on it yet. I don\'t think my characters are stiff per se, but I wish they were a bit livelier and expressed themselves through their bodies as well as their words. I think practice will help fix this, as well as experimenting a bit more with my art. I need to do some of those ""arm studies"" and ""leg studies"" and the like. - one positive thing about my work is the environments. I think I do a good job of creating nice backgrounds with interesting colors and details. - Here\'s my comic, Reus1 - focusing of ch 1 pg 1 of Tales of Adestria: Quixel, one criticism I have is the shading. There\'s a shadow underneath Quixel (I assume that\'s his name?), but there isn\'t any shading on his actual body. Since he\'s in a prison cell, it\'s probably pretty dark in there, but the shadow you have suggests there\'s a very bright light directly above him.-compliment: I like how much Quixel moves in the first page. Even though he doesn\'t say much, his body positioning does a good job of expressing what\'s on his mind. ', ""\nArt is like a very intimate and alternative way of processing thoughts, everyday it shows me parts of me that I didn't know they existed at all.\nThe way  I work tends to be hard to deal with cause it's halfway between too unfinished or overly detailed, and tends to look unpolished.\n\nI guess it's a reflection of my personality, and will eventually fix itself once i fix it on everything else.\n\nOn the other way I'm stubborn enough to try as many things as possible and I'm always willing to experiment new things including landscapes and  perspectives. It's my first time drawing so many different things.\nmy comic: THRENODY - The Ynir Saga2\n@Cielle  I think there's too much writing that could be broke down in a friendlier way. my ADHD doesn't allow me to go through such an endless page full of plain writing. Take out what isn't necessary, and what is, you could try to play with it and make it more dynamic.\n\nleave spaces for example\nit makes you focus better on the phrases\nand\n.\n.\n.\nisn't as overwhelming, cause when  broken down in different pages the reader doesn't know how much more writing there is \nOn the positive side: I really like the tiny details that you include (e.g the people sitting in the bar) It makes your drawings so interesting to look at! It really shows the essence of your creative mind! keep it up!  "", ""What I love about art: Art holds a dear place for me because it is a realm to play with ideas and concepts that can teach and inform. It is also a beautiful form of expression to show off the purity of one's soul.\nCons of my work: The obvious chink in my armor right now is text. I wanted to hand write everything but that has proven harder to do than I realized. I will either print out some text to cover what I have done or just grind on the craft until my handwriting improves.\nPros of my work: I like having a blend of realistic anatomy in terms of proportions for the characters and a mildly simplified aspects brought about from anime and other cartoon influences.\nLink: Visceral1\nCons of yartzanaserenad's work: Line work could use a little more polish. The lines could either be a stylized sketchy roughness or clean crisp. Depends on which effect you want to achieve. A little more reference for body proportions would also boost your craftsmanship.  \nPros of yartzanaserenad's work: Elegant use of analogous colors! Camera shots work well to create an even, slow pace for the comic."", ""I love making comics because as a professionally trained video producer, I think more in images than I do text, but as a writer, I have all the stories I just want to bring to life, so comics and graphic novels are the best way I know how to do this. I also just enjoy it because it's a fun form of expression that anyone can do, no matter their talent level.\nMy criticism of my work is that I don't have as much talent was I would like to have. I have very little time to work on my comics although I love them, and I think that's reflected on my work a lot.\nMy positive is that I'm really proud of myself for finally sticking to my comic projects and publishing them each week. There's just something satisfying about seeing your work published on the website after all the blood, sweat, and tears to make it happen.\nMy works: Satu Warriors3 and MuMeme2.\n(the following is my reply for the poster above me, assuming someone who is faster at typing hasn't replied to them already while I was working on this...)\nCriticism for @jessicasurline: The comic you linked to hasn't been updated since December. Don't leave me hanging--I want to see how the story goes.\nPositive: Your story is very interesting so far. I love how much detail you put into each of your drawings. I can tell your art is very important to you and you take your time to do it right. I love your realistic detailing as well."", ""-I like art because it's really fun, plain and simple. I mean that's enough, right?-One criticism about my work I guess is it might be TOO simple? But I always improve everyday and I wake up every day knowing that today, I will get better if only slightly.-I guess one positive thing I can say about my work is that it's very colorful ( For RFI, I make the backgrounds grey to make the characters pop) Others seem to like it, and I really can't complain.- Here's my comic. http://tapastic.com/series/Room-for-Improvement1-lanceredding Your comic looks pretty good, nice style. However, there are a few times where the characters look a bit off. I hope you don't take offense, I'm really sorry if I did."", 'Thanks for the crit @punkarsenic!!

Hosting this small event was fun and I hope everyone who participated enjoyed drawing these pictures and hopefully got out of their comfort zone to improve their own comics.

681,A journey of art and discovery. What do you think?,Events | Challenges,[],"So lately, I've been unsatisfied with my own artwork. It's just not on par with what I've done before, and what I know I'm capable of. I'm just still not very good at comic art, I suppose. That and how long it takes me to do a page.
My solution is to do what I'm calling an ""art journey"".Basically, instead of doing my comic (which is on temporary hiatus), I will be posting multiple pictures of one character-- in each picture will be done in an immitation of a different artist's style. Perhaps by examining those whose work I admire, I may learn something.My purpose in this is to develop a simpler, more unique, and more satisfying drawing style. That way, I'll be able to keep up a more regular schedule, and I'll be able to enjoy what I do much more.
And that's all well and good, but here's where I come to you, o forum folk. I'd like there to be some interactive, even  co-operative element to all this. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.I'm thinking either I'll take requests regarding the art styles to draw in, or if other people want to do something similar, we  an share the results of our journeying.Either way, I will be posting the various drawing I do here.
Well, I'll leave it at that before I go off on a tangent, as I am prone to do ^__^
If you have any thoughts on the matter-- suggestions, recommendations, ideas... feel free to share them.
Take care!","[""Developing a style is really hard, and honestly it'll always be ever-changing. \nI went through the same thing when I started my webtoon3, and I'm absolutely positive it's noticeable that I've been changing and altering (and sometimes struggling with) my style... but through that struggle I've found that it's really helpful in this case to focus on quantity over worrying about quality, as it's just getting used to how you draw and picking out what you like and repeating it. I honestly hate some of the awkward issues in my pages caused by all of this, but I'm not going to delete or alter them because I figure that as long as we as artists are aware of these things, it's not as bad as continuing to make mistakes unknowingly. Those mistakes should be a testament to how much you will improve in the future through motivation.\nYour idea is awesome, as long as you don't give up on your personal element and style! (Not that you would, but you know what I mean.) I hope taking some qualities you like in other styles can help you figure it out a bit more! It's a painful struggle, I can relate. \nI'm collecting fan art of my webtoon, so if you want to draw a character of mine using my (later) pages, I would absolutely love to see it!!"", 'This sounds like an interesting idea. Personally, I think ""style"" is something that develops naturally, and can change over time - and I\'ve always found that comics are a great way to make myself draw on a regular schedule, thus forcing me to practise whatever my style is. And the only way I\'ve gotten faster at drawing comics is, well, drawing comics. \nBut yeah, developing a simpler style might be a good way to get started!\nAside from attempting to imitate the styles of other people, I\'d recommend you do a LOT of anatomy practise (preferably lifedrawing, but photos will do in a pinch) because there is no substitute for learning how to draw characters than to draw from reference. And that goes even if you intend to draw non-human characters - nature is the best character designer there is. Learn the rules, and then stylise based on that. Look at all the best cartoony styles you can think of - no matter how far from ""realism"" they might be, they are all grounded in a solid knowledge of anatomy, colour theory and perspective. \nHappy practising!', ""Style is something constantly evolving to me. Every time I see a new artist I like, I analyze their style and try to absorb it into mine... so, most of the time, my comic isn't very consistent. Hopefully you find something you like and run with it!"", ""This sounds like it be really fun to try, I look forward to seeing your art. I might try it sometime if I can find time outside of thumb nailing.\nDo you know if you'll have a specific favorite style. I'm wanting to go for a style myself where it's realistic enough, but also unrealistic enough that the art doesn't outshine the comic style."", 'Sounds like a awesome idea. But if you want to try different styles and us to reccomend some, maybe it i best to know what you already like.. like genre, or maybe some favorite illustrators of yours.', ""I'm a subscriber, so I won't lie to you... I really want so see where your story is going to lead, and tho I'm sad about the hiatus I totally understand your frustration - if I can call it like that - because sometimes I just feel the same.  I usually think like @AnnaLandin said, I feel doing comics is a great way to improve my drawings and my style. I wish you luck on your journey. (Wow this sounds so epic =o)"", 'I understand what you mean, and that is definitely true, but the problem here is that I\'m not looking back at old drawings and thinking ""oh man, I wasn\'t very good back then"", I\'m looking at pictures I just finished and thinking ""this isn\'t good enough. I\'m not happy with this, but I\'m posting it anyways because I have to"". I\'m very happy that people like my story at all, but I am not enjoying the art I\'m making itself.', ""Oh I'm sorry about that, that's what I meant I was feeling at the time I was posting. I think that's a huge part of learning to fix and create your style, and is of course incredibly frustrating. Are there any specifics or is it hard to point out what exactly you don't like? Because if there are no general specifics, it could be an art block or related to some extra depression (which would be really good to get help for in that case)."", 'Usually, style is something that develops over time. But desperate times call for desperate measures.\nBut yeah, that is true though. Even (if not especially) the best web comics start out looking far less good than they do after months or years of practice.', 'Thank you for your kind words : DI really like Ivan, too. Of course, I like all of them (I wouldn\'t tell their story if I didn\'t), but in different ways.\nThe thing is that I like my regular drawings well enough. I have been drawing for as long as I can remember, and though I\'m not ""pro"", I think I\'m okay. But comics are very different than concept art and character sketches. I don\'t know what it is, but as soon as I start drawing a comic, it\'s like instant meh.But I digress.\nYeah, I\'m going to focus mostly on artists that I think I might be able to learn from. There are a couple that I may want to draw just for fun, but mostly it\'s with a clear(ish) goal in mind.\nYeah, that makes perfect sense.And thanks! I appreciate it : )', 'You develop a style by just drawing everyday. It happens. You don\'t have to force it.\nI feel this journey will not serve you well. Drawing a character in someone else\'s style once or a few times and then moving on to someone else\'s style will not help you learn much. You will only be copying the surface. You will get nothing of what brought this person to that style and their understanding of it.\nIf you want to improve, then go back to the basics. Shapes, shading, anatomy, perspective, figure drawing classes, going to park and/or mall making gesture drawings. Learn and do those things to improve.\nIf you feel the impulse to respond to this post with ""I can\'t do that because..."" Then all it means is you\'re not really serious about spending tine to improve.  You just want to take shortcuts that give the illusion of improvement.\nExcuses will keep an artist down.', ""@KaiLynxNo need to apologize  : )It's not one thing in particular, but a number of things. One of the big ones, however, is that I'm kind of a perfectionist, which means that I take way too long on a picture than I should. This results in my comic pages being late, which makes me feel bad about it. And when I feel rushed to complete things sooner, I start get a little sloppy, but can't take the time to fix it. So it's kind of a cycle.And no, it's not art block, and it's not depression. So don't worry about that. I'm fine, I just feel that my skills haven't increased enough lately, especially when it comes to comics.\n@abbastudiosFirst of all, thank you. I appreciate your honesty, and the time you took to say this.You are definitely right. Just drawing a couple of pictures in a cheep imitation of other, more successful artists won't magically solve my problems, and it certainly won't give me the insight and experiences that brought them to developing their styles. However, like practicing anything new, I'm trying to expose myself to some simpler, more streamlined styles. I've been drawing a certain way all my life and never really learned how to draw without spending a long time on every little thing.But even if that doesn't work... even if I learn nothing from this and gain nothing of value... I want to draw something fun. I'm not having fun drawing my comic the way it is. If it helps, then I can continue my story in a way that will satisfy me. If not, well, I don't know. I'll have to figure that out then.And my regular drawings are fine. I'm not professional or anything, but I am happy with my art. It's just comics that give me trouble for some reason.\nWhatever. I'm just rambling at this point. Sorry.\nAnyways, I appreciate the advice, and I will keep it in mind. But this is something that I want to do, in addition to whatever else I may do to get out of this mess."", 'What is the difference between your regular drawings and comics? Please explain.', ""I'm really not sure, precisely. I think it has something to do with the repetitiveness of drawing a comic-- having to draw the same characters multiple times per page.Also, I tend to take a long time drawing anything. But when drawing a comic, I have to complete pages more quickly, so I end up rushing. Then I make mistakes-- even minor ones, but feel like I don't have the time to get it well enough to satisfy my unrealistic self-expectations. Sometimes I don't even notice the mistakes until it's inked in and it's too late to correct.\nJust to be clear though, I'm not trying to use someone else's style, I'm experimenting in ways to learn to apply my style to a simpler format. Or something like that.\nBut I've been thinking about it, and I may change the parameters of my art journey. I may just do a number of sketches, experimenting by myself instead of doing an imitation of other people's styles. I still plan on studying other artist's work, but not worry about trying do drawings in emulation of their styles.Or something.But I already started on the first one, so I'm going to finish it just for fun (if nothing else).Anyways, I'm still not entirely sure.""]",5/3/2015 23:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

683,Alternate Universe Art Event sign ups,Events | Challenges,[],"The Alternate Universe Event sign ups start today. ""What is this event"" you ask? Well, this event will have you drawing a possible version of your character(s) based on any genre you are given by me. There are five different genres to get, random of course, which are vague enough to keep your picture your own. 
The Five ""Universe"" are:Film Noir: This universe is based on the gritty cop films mostly from the 1930's/1940's. Of course there are modern takes on film noir, so you aren't limited to that time period. Though fedoras and trench coats are fun to draw. The key is in the heavy use of black-n-white. Also most noir's take place in large cities.Fairy Tale/Medieval: A universe based on ye ol tales of dragons and castles. You can either base your drawing on the tales from the Brothers Grimm, or take a more realistic approach and have your character exist in 1400's Europe. These are only two solutions, as you can base you pics on anything medieval-related (like the Lord of the Rings)Steampunk: A popular universe, this genre has late-19th Century technology designs on large ""Hi-tech"" machines like robots and flying ships. These machines consist of large gears and smoke valves and are very much based on the look of the Victorian Era. Browns and Golds are usually used the most here.Dystopian Future: A bad future can be many things. It can be a dictatorship state like 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. It can be a crime ridden future like The Dark Night Returns or Robocop. Or it can be post-apocalyptic like The Terminator or The Last of Us. Or it can even be strictly important to your story, like a main character dying. My advice is to age your characters.Different Culture: This is probably the most tricky. This universe has you draw your character as if it was made from a culture/style not your own. This can be Silver Age (1950's-1970's) American Superhero comics or modern Japanese Anime, or even past civilizations like ancient Greek gods or Egyptian hieroglyphs. You don't need to change your drawing style per-say, but it might help.
In terms of the picture itself, there three ways to make it that I thought up. One way is to make a character turnaround/model sheet, focusing on one character. The second is to make a poster. This way you can include multiple characters and a background. The last method is to take a page from your webcomic and alter it to fit the genre you were given. Keep in mind you might have to change the dialogue to fit the time period of certain genres like Film Noir and Medieval. You should definitely change your character's costumes as this will be the largest change from your main universe. Style wise, you only need to change it if you feel like it.
If you need a visual example, here's my character ""The J"" normal and with the Noir Universe

Now on to signing up. It's simple. If you have 3 or more subs and think you'd like to join, then leave a comment with your name and a link to the comic you''l be using. Also, if your comic already falls under any of the Universe Genres, please state so in your comment so that I don't accidentally give you that genre (otherwise this event will be kinda pointless for you).Sign ups will be held from March 21st to March 28th. After that I'll post what genre each person got on the forum by April 4th. Then you will have all of April to finish the picture. And finally, I'll post the pictures (by genre) on the forum on May 2nd along with links to all comics featured in the event.
When you finish your picture, email it to me at jonnyalekseywashere@gmail.com. Save your images as ""(comic name)-(genre)"", for example mine would be ""Jonny Comic-Noir.png"". Also make sure it's either a JPEG or PNG.

685,4/25 Creator Newletter Ad Revenue,Events | Challenges,[],"Oh!!! Check out this Creator Newletter about Ad Revenue! This sounds very exciting XD___________________________________________________________________________

 Hey, hi, hello!
 We're excited to announce that we're opening up our Ad Revenue Program to eligible creators on May 1st! 
 Eligibility is super simple: You'll need to be 18 years or older and must have access to a Paypal account for deposits. That's it. 
Create. Share. Profit.
 We've been working super hard on all the behind the scenes mechanics to make all of this possible and wanted to celebrate this moment with everyone in our community. Peter came up with this great idea to use this service called Thunderclap25 in order to get the word out to as many readers and creators as possible. 
 Thunderclap25 is a service that allows for anyone to contribute their social media (tumblr, twitter or facebook) accounts for a huge synchronized shoutout on the day of our launch.  
 Please help us by lending your voice. Together with other creators on Tapastic, we can make our voices be heard. We can't do this without you. 
Thunderclap with Us!25
 We believe that it's important to create a culture around rewarding creators for their hard work. All too often, we see sites take art from creators and repost them, never taking time to credit the original source and never paying out a single penny to the creators.
 We want to change that.
 We want to create a culture where we encourage readers to be active participants in the creative journey of artists - by directly supporting them. We understand that not everyone can support creators monetarily, but fear not! Just by reading, they'll be helping you out. 
 Best of all? We're all in this together. Because we're home to so many creators and so many readers, we can demand better rates for ad revenue. This means that just by being part of the Tapastic community, you'll be helping other creators as well as yourself. 
 Together, we're going to do great things. Now help us bring the noise with Thunderclap25. all the best, 2 -Michael from Tapastic","[""I'm so excited for it!  This would allow me to spend more time on my comics!"", ""I just saw that, it's super awesome :o :o"", 'Oh my gosh! This is very awesome!!!!!! XD', ""This looks like it'll be a great addition to Tapastics can't wait to see what happens when it's released "", ""Call me a skeptic, I'm excited for this. I'm just curious what tapastic gets out of it? From what it looks like it'd just be us creators getting a percentage off the ads that were already on our comics? So seems like tapastic would be losing money in that case? Not that I don't think this is great and the message is great, support artists I'm all for that, I'm just curious about the details."", ""@Sketchmazoid: The Ad Revenue program has been in place for a long time, but it was only eligible for comics that made $25/month. Tapastic does take a small percentage from the ad revenue. So let's say you make $5, they might take $1 (it's not 50% but it is a litle bit, maybe a staff member could confirm this? Thanks  )"", ""I tend to think it's more an investment than a loss of money: if creators can get money on Tapastic through ad revenue, they're more likely to come here to publish their comics, which means more episode, more ads, and more ad revenue.\nI find this really nice and I do appreciate the aim of changing the culture. People got so used to webcomics being free that they have a harder time giving a coin to comickers than some other types of artists like musicians. It's high time people realize what time it takes to create webcomics and that some of us are trying to make a living as comic artists =)"", 'http://tapastic.com/faq#what-is-tapastics-commission-ad-rev11 here you go', ""I realize this, but what do they have to gain from it? They had 100% now they're giving us 50% that seems less than beneficial to them. Is all."", ""Yes, they did take 100% before - but it was 100% of a sizeable cake. If they offer 50% of the revenue, they get more creators - who are attracted by the idea that they can get some money out of posting their work on Tapastic - which means that even if they get 50%, it's 50% of a much larger cake, which in final profits means more money for Tapastic.\nAlso, it means people will thing positive things about Tapastic, which means they're more likely to tell other people good things about Tapastic - and a good reputation is worth a lot."", 'Forgive me if im wrong,Ad revenue is..Revenue gain from adverstisement correct?Tapastic have ad here?So far my time here i havent seen any advert at all..', '\n\nratique:\nMy guess is that Tapastic is trying to stay competitive. Line has been stealing a lot of artists and some of my most favorite webcomics lately. The step of sharing add revenue might keep some creators here instead of moving over to other sites exclusively.\nAre you referring to Tapastic comics that are now Line exclusive?', 'This is great news! Offered my little support.', ""I've been waiting for this! Very happy the new ad revenue program is finally being implemented."", ""Same here! It was one of the many factors that got me into joining Tapastic :')"", ""If you have adblock turned on, you can't see them.

Just kidding, I appreciate the questions. \nI'm just curious what tapastic gets out of it?\n\n\nnoxfox:\nI tend to think it's more an investment than a loss of money\nDefinitely! It's more of a long term investment. We want to change the consumer and producer culture regarding digital content. We want to pay creators who work hard in making and sharing their work. We want to help readers have a more active role in our community by empowering them to have an impact on a creator's life. \nBy creating this type of culture, we are able to set new standards for webcomics which in turn help us establish a legitimate industry in the long run. \nThey had 100% now they're giving us 50% that seems less than beneficial to them.\nBut we want to pay you. \nWe want to be a home for a creator's entire career in webcomics. For creators who have never made a comic before, we want to provide  a lower barrier to entry with free hosting and publishing tools. From there we want every creator to see that you can make money by making good art with ad revenue from the moment they join. For creators that continue to publish and are focused on creating a strong fan community, we have the support program. And finally, down the road  for creators who have finished their work, we have Premium. \nNot every creator will follow this path, and not every creator should. But the basic structure is there and we want to continually build more tools and features to help support that. A big piece of that is ad revenue, and it's been a long time coming but it's finally here. \nWe never intended on keeping creators out of the Ad Revenue Program, we wanted to have it open to everyone. There were just behind the scenes logistics that got in the way. \n\nHm... Not really business related, but it feels different when you get paid to do something. It just feels good, regardless of the amount you're making. \nIt's my personal belief that it's not enough for a site like Tapastic to just function. You have to feel good using it. We want to create personal connections between readers and creators. But we also want to create that same connection between everyone and Tapsatic. I want you to look forward to uploading (thumbnails be damned!) and I want you to look forward to coming back. \nWill ad revenue do that? Maybe, but we know that it's a step in a good direction.""]",4/25/2015 4:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Hey hi hello! 
Tapastic is excited to announce our collaboration with Viber, one of the leading messenger apps for iOS and Android. They recently launched a new feature called Public Chats where you can find us featured under Daily Comic Snack. 
You can check us out here: http://chats.viber.com/comicsnack61
We really want to get our reader community involved with this collaboration. Creators put in a lot of work just creating content, so it'd be great to get readers to show them some love. 
We're currently taking applications for a voluntary moderating position. Here's what we'll need:
1) Download the app and join our Public Chat2) A list of your top 10 favorite episodes on Tapastic (any series, any genre)3) Your time zone4) A little bit about yourself and how you got interested in webcomics 
Please e-mail us at hello@tapastic.com with the subject line: LET'S VIBE!
We're also looking for some guest creators to help us moderate and post episodes from time to time so feel free to send us an application too! 
This unique collaboration allows us to showcase Tapastic creators to new and exciting audiences and we hope to bring you even more collaborations with innovative companies. 
Feel free to leave any questions and comments!  ","['Seriously, this is a great way to contribute to the community. If you are passionate about helping comic creators gain a wider audience, please let us know. If you are already spending a lot of time reading on Tapastic, why not press a couple of more buttons and share your favorites with others while helping out creators at the same time?

693,Alt Universe Art Event idea,Events | Challenges,[],"Hello everybody. I have an idea for a Secret Santa-type art event thing. I'm not entirely sure what to call it. Basically, it revolves around one of my favorite things about comics: The MULTIVERSE! So I have five vague ideas for different types of universes: ""Film Noir"", ""Steampunk"", ""Fairy Tales/Medieval"", ""Different Culture"", and ""Dystopian Future"". I will give the participant any one of these ideas, and they will make a version of their character based on that idea. They can make a model turnaround, a poster, or an alternate version of one of their own pages. Then when it's all done I'll upload the pages within each category on the forum.I guess if there are to be rules
 1: The comic must have at least 3-5 subs and a decent amount of content (like 10 pages or something). Just enough to get an understanding of said character/environment.                                              2: No nudity or excessive gore. Let's keep it PG folks.
That's it. If you think you might want to join in then tell me. I'll try to find a good date to start it, though MoCCA Fest might take up a lot of my time. I like my choices but if you have better ideas for alternate universes then tell me (though I didn't chose ""Gender-Bending"" or ""Zombies"" because they seemed too obvious and boring).","[""What about... an animal/hybrid universe o3o\nAlso, I'd like to join this XD"", 'Maybe but I think that could be applied to fairy tale since a lot of mystical creatures are hybrids of animals.

698,How can the Forums be more useful for readers?,Events | Challenges,[],"As you might have noticed, we've added Forums as one of the links in the main menu to increase discoverability. But currently it feels like Forums are mostly for creators. How can we improve this and make the Forums more useful for the readers (non-creators)? Any thoughts/ideas?","['Add an area for readers to post their favourite comics, so people can have an interactional experience of describing why they love a comic! This can also be made into a category for reviews, so people can go into more detail about the pros and cons of a comic and design style. It would also be beneficial for the creators as well. ', 'Hmm maybe a category or a section where readers can discuss comic-specific things, like the plot of a certain comic, story speculations, favorite characters?', 'If I look at the forums from a reader-specific perspective, it looks really creator-exclusive. If I\'m not a creator, there\'s not much that I can relate to on the forums. If I wanted to make a thread about this new show that I watched, I would feel a bit silly posting it on a forum where everyone is serious about seeking help and improvement about comics. It might feel too serious for the average reader to want to contribute. And perhaps also too ""comic-specific"". Looking at it from a different angle- if I\'m only a reader, what would I have to contribute to the forums that isn\'t about making comics? I could only contribute my interest and opinion in things. My knowledge and experience would be limited compared to people who have drawn and written for a lifetime, so I\'ll talk about things that are easy or familiar or ""acceptable""  for me to talk about. I think the forums don\'t really encourage those sort of topics. \nI don\'t know if this would be considered ""useful for readers"", but you could have an ""Off-Topic"" or ""Anything goes"" category that specifically affirms talking about things not necessarily comic related.  Even multiple off-topic categories would be good. I know there is already an ""Uncategorized"" category, but the description of it seems too serious to encourage really non-comic related things. I think a part of the reason why the forums seems to cater mostly to creators is because the categories seem to cater mostly to creators. Naturally, the threads created within them also cater mostly to creators. Also, I noticed that most of the categories don\'t have descriptions on them. They may seem self-explanatory, but it would be better to have clear descriptions of what is encouraged and what isn\'t.  Even better, if those descriptions invite me to post about things I can relate to I would feel much more comfortable to contribute.\nYou could also do a front page Spotlight feature about it to invite everyone to join in.\nI think you\'ve got the helpful/useful part covered- if a reader was experiencing some problem on the website, it\'d be easy to use the forums to ask for assistance. There are clear places for them to do so.\nI hope this helped somewhat.', 'Oh yeah, we love random / misc stuff so feel free to talk about those things! Of course the point would be how to create an atmosphere where people can feel more comfortable talking about random stuff. Another idea that we always talked about was to have forums around comic series, where people can talk about specific comic series in a different fashion from comments (comments would be more about a specific post/episode.) Also, we wanted to use forums to be the primary channel of announcements from the company/service, so we might as well do more of those ', ""\n\novisrock:\nAlso, I noticed that most of the categories don't have descriptions on them. They may seem self-explanatory, but it would be better to have clear descriptions of what is encouraged and what isn't.\nI totally agree with this. Not everything is as clear as you might think it is. I struggled to find a place to put my thoughts multiple times, because as a non-creator, I can't seem to find a category that I can just post my opinions on things.\nI think it is important for readers and creators to interact but the way the forums are now, it is difficult for readers to have an opinion on the topics. We just don't have the expertise that other comic creators do. There isn't much we can contribute with as it stands. \nAs I mentioned earlier, adding a Reviews category would be nice, or a category where we can suggest our favourite comics on Tapastic."", 'They kind of tried this on Ink Blazers, but it was not really successful for how they implemented it.But like have an area were comic creators can make a specific thread for their comic where fans can go and chat with the artist. It would be neat to have this listed with the comic page/site/profile so people reading can see they have one of these threads. \nI want to point this out, It would be like how this avatar/pet site did hangouts ( http://www.kofk.de/viewforum.php?f=172 ) were each user can make one topic for random chatting, something like that.', ""I agree with some of the ideas posted above. Q&A sessions with the more popular artists/writers would go a long way in obtaining more readers in the forums. You should also look at doing articles/interviews as well. A reader suggestion box helps for those looking to recommend comics or things with the tapastic reading experience. And then there's always contests and such.\nPerhaps some end of the year awards voted on by staff, some voted on by creators, and reader's choice?\nThe thing with having a lot of threads and subforums is clutter. With all of the titles available and different tastes/genres, it is very easy to segment the community with a lot of available choices. There is also a language barrier - I understand that a large demographic of users are from Asia, so having a predominantly English forum won't help. Unless you have some sort of universal translator of some kind."", '@Drezz Actually most of our readers come from the English-speaking world.  I like the idea of artists Q&A.', 'Good to know - I must have misunderstood. For some reason I thought there was a larger readership overseas, given the genre of comics on tapastic, some of the sponsored artists and comments that were made initially about the popularity of webtoons in Korea and abroad.', ""Yeah, we were indeed directly inspired by the success of Korean webtoons. But we've built a global platform. About 50% of our readers come from the US and the rest is from all over the world, representing 210 countries."", ""I can't imagine how complicated this would be to implement, or if it's already there and I'm overlooking it, but maybe if there was a way to have forums specifically for conversation and speculation on a particular comic. Maybe someway to expand the comments section as a forum or hub for comments about a comic. Just an easier way for people to speak and engage about their favorite comics along with its creator.

If you would be interested,  please comment or PM me and I'll start a list on this post,  and help match you all up  besides it would be fun to see you or your character in the art style and setting of some of your favorite comics here!  Give a shout out to the series you would love to match up with.

Gives recognition to those who deserve it at least, which is functionally what an award should do!', '@hierogriff  Well i think that you could see Spotlight as a Award, but in some ways new comics or differents comics, may have a difficult chance of being in Spotlight, and they are eclipsed by other comics, you could thing that Spotlight is the ""Mainstream"" awards, and they want to do something like the ""Alternative"" Awards, awards to specific things like ""best Dark fantasy"" or ""best comedy"" or ""best serial series"", so that more comics of specific categories got more recognition, for example lets say you are doing a comic that belongs to an specific genre that dosent have that much fans, but even if its a good comic, people that like that genre are going to have a harder time finding because its not popular, and i think this can help if its done right.And more on the topic to not make this a ""popularity contest"" i think you would need to put a limitation, like a series above X number of subscribers cant win an award or make 2 contest for each category one below X number of subscriber and one above that number', ""How about the same author couldn't win more than one award a year, and the same award more than once ever. The first year may be a bit biased to the popular comics, but subsequent years would focus more on lesser known ones as other comics are eliminated from winning by winning.\nI think a max follower limitation wouldn't work, as it'd need to be changed proportional to increasing tapastic users."", 'the idea that an author couldnt win the same award more than once, and only just one award per year i think its kinda of cool and would work, and also yeah the Max number of followers rule if used would need to change each year ', ""I think the idea of awards would be great, the only thing is I'd like to see it more geared toward helping comics that are lesser known."", ""I agree with @gavacho13. It would only go to the more known comics of tapastic. It'd have to be fair in everyone's eyes! "", ""Maybe there could be certain requirements during different months for voters choice, such as perhaps the comic can only be voted into the category once a year to prevent the same comic being voted for over again. That and perhaps some months there'd be other requirements such as having fewer than X subscribers or having been on tapastic X months, or a combo of both that can help unveil some of those gem in the rough works. (cough cough like Demon's Mirror4 owo. Seriously how do some of these amazing comics go unnoticed?)"", ""Totally agree with that! Those would be some good parameters.\nDemon's Mirror blows my mind, I don't understand the phenomenon either of how it's going unnoticed."", ""Most art shows I have been in have awards. They usually use a panel of 3 judges. One judge is a guest judge, a highly talented and well thought of artist who gives up competing in order to be the guest judge. The 3 judge walk through the floor at different times taking a look at the pieces nominated or entered. They write down scores based on criteria.  Then go back, tally scores and talk amongst themselves to give each other their thoughts on the strongest pieces and why. It's rarely a popularity contest with this formula, at the ones I've been to. I'll try to remember the categories I've seen.

716,R.I.P Chespirito,Events | Challenges,[],"This picture is devoted to the death of Roberto Gomez Bolanos, A.K.A. ""Chespirito.""(As seen in the link below)
http://rayleeman.deviantart.com/art/R-I-P-Chespirito-49765621514
For those of you who don't know who Chespirito is, he is a Mexican comedian who created such shows as ""El Chavo""(The Kid) and ""El Chapulin Colorado.""(The Red Grasshopper), which became popular in there homeland(Latin America) and in several parts of the world, including the U.S and Japan!(No lie!) He even created a sketch show with both of his two popular characters, along with some other characters that became well-known.(An ironically, the show was called his pen name)
If you wanna know more about him, check it out here: www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chespirito2
But please, don't go too hard on this pic, as it is not only devoted to Chespirito's death, but it is also dedicated to Chespirtio himself and his works, as they always made me feel better even at the hardest of times. 
So, all in all, thank you Chespirito, for not only making me laugh and cry, but for everyone else as well! Your works have entertained and inspired an entire generation, especially in your own Homeland, and will continue to do the same for future generations to come. Again, thank you, thank you for everything. 
R.I.P. Chespirito, 1929-2014
You will be missed.","[""He will be indeed missed. His popularity in the Spanish-speaking world wasn't limited to Latin America: in Spain, reruns of El Chavo and El Chapulín were in national television until recently."", ""I grew up watching those shows. I had no idea he passed on. To think of how many times he's made me laugh is incomprehensible. I miss him already.

When I found the tweet from someone who participates to Randomania, when I redo the search a few days later, he disappears from the results.\nIf anything, there might be some Randomania-related tweets that doesn't appear in my search results, because of the poor search engine.\nThat's why, from now on, you must send your tweets with the hashtag (#Randomania) AND my Twitter username (@TheHaris34).

For three reasons.\n1. Lack of participation\nSome of you remembered that the concept of the project was about random stories based on words given by the community. Unfortunately, that\'s the problem. Since I announced Randomania in early September, only three people have participated, including two who are actually close friends of mine. I think the problem is that the concept could only work if the artist already have a popular feedback, while I\'m actually considered as a stranger. Even some friends and subscribers of mine were excited about the project but was rebuffed on the fact to participate by using Twitter. And I tried to share about the project as much as possible to keep abreast of its existence to the mainstream Internet audience. But the only result was, else I was unnoticed, else some troll said to me ""fuck this shit! you suck!"" (I\'m speaking to you, 4chan).\n2. More focus on PullCat and my studies\nI already said that Randomania doesn\'t seem to work was because of my too modest rank as a Internet artist. And I\'ll going to fix that by putting more focus and effort on a comic series that I had already been working on it for a long time : PullCat. I\'ll revise my release schedule in order to release more comics more frequently, I\'ll make the character more present in the social networks, as I\'m thinking about a dedicated Facebook pages and I even have some ideas for PullCat beyond the comics. I also need more time to put more focus on my studies, since I\'m actually in my last year before getting my professional degree.\n3. Lost interest in it\nMainly because of the lack of participation, but sometimes, I wonder myself how I could make this concept work, as I was afraid to think if the result will come as unfunny and even predictable. Even with the words I got from the rare participants, I predicted myself that I would be unsatisfied with the final result. Not that the ideas that people gave me are bad, I mean that I don\'t think they would work together as something funny. Add it the fact that I was counting on people that probably don\'t care about me and my work, giving the impression that I don\'t have ideas. And that\'s why I want to use my own ideas instead of others.\nBut beware! I said that Randomania has been put on hold, not canceled. Maybe one day, I will bring it back when I\'ll gain a supportive audience and interest into making it.

(Know NaNoWrMo (National Novel Writing Month)? This is way more fun!)

Thirty-one days, thirty-one ink drawings. Are you ready?!   INKtober rules:
1) Make a drawing in ink (you can do a pencil under-drawing if you want).
2) Post it IN THIS FORUM POST (or tumblr, Instagram, twitter, facebook, flickr, Pinterest or just pin it on your wall with #inktober and #tapastic.)
3) Repeat (you can do it daily, like me, or go the half-marathon route and post every other day, or just do the 5K and post once a week. Whatever you decide, just be consistent with it. INKtober is about growing and improving and forming positive habits, so the more you’re consistent the better.)

Hopefully this catches someone's eye so we can continue making weekly updates >_<

This game is simply 20 questions. The person to guess correctly, starts the next round. If after 20 guesses the right answer isn't posted, the second person who guessed starts the next round. 
Rules:1) You need to give a good clue of the answer (e.g. you might say ""an animal"")2) You must include a picture of something related to your thing (e.g. the picture of a tire, if you want people to guess car)3) The original poster (OP) can only post twice: The first being to start the game, the second being to confirm someone's guess OR cede to the second guesser in the event 20 guesses have been exhausted. Don't give additional clues and don't say ""no, close"" etc... keep guessing until OP confirms or cedes!
